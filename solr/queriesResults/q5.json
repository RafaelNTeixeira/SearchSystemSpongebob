  "synopsis": [
   "There is a large mob of angry customers in the Krusty Krab, leaving Mr. Krabs confused. He goes into the kitchen to see SpongeBob's mother, Margaret, making Krabby Patties with love and care. SpongeBob explains that it is Bring Your Mom to Work Day. Krabs and Squidward's moms show up, with the former lecturing her son about how he could be even cheaper to save money, while the latter nags Squidward as he tries to take orders.Margaret serves Old Man Jenkins' food, and the taste of it makes Old Man Jenkins remember his own childhood. The customers no longer want SpongeBob's food because it is produced fast and without love, making them riot. The mothers decide they should run the restaurant, and sentence their sons to the \"shame corner.\" Mr. Krabs' mother renovates the restaurant, saving money using things that Margaret had in her car. Krabs decides he can reclaim the Krusty Krab once their moms get exhausted, and Bubble Bass shows up.Mr. Krabs' mother serves Bubble Bass and Mama Bass. Mama Bass babies her son, and Margaret serves the food. SpongeBob realizes that everyone is liking the restaurant more. Squidward feels guilty seeing the moms do all the work, but Bubble Bass claims they need to embrace their mothers' love more. He takes them to the Krusty Krab basement and turns it into a hangout. He explains that they can do whatever they want while having their mothers serving them snacks. Bubble Bass leaves to get ice cream with his mother.SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward hang out in the basement, acting as slackers and demanding things from their mothers. After a sleepover, they wake up to find a bunch of dads in the restaurant. Their own dads are there too, and SpongeBob realizes it's Bring Your Dad to Work Day. When their dads make requests, they collapse and cry out for their mommies."

   "[The episode begins with a far shot of the Krusty Krab. Inside, many angry customers have gathered around the register.] Customers: [angry clamoring] Mr. Krabs: [comes out of his office] Huh? [sees everyone, Squidward is reading a magazine with headphones on; he pushes the customers away and takes his headphones off] What's the meaning of this, Mr. Squidward? Squidward: [puts magazine down] Don't ask me. [points at  kitchen window] Ask SpongeBob. [In the kitchen, SpongeBob's mother, Margaret, is cutting the crusts off a Krabby Patty.] Margaret: [humming] SpongeBob: Hey, um, Mom, you don't need to cut the crust off the Krabby Patty. Ha, we are making fast food. Margaret: [turns to him] Love takes time, darling. Now hand me a tomato so I can [waves hand] carve it into a rose garnish. Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [opens door, angry customers are outside] What in blue blazes is going on in-- [notices, politely] oh, hello, Mrs. SquarePants. Margaret: Well, hello, Eugene! [holds out patty] I'm learning how to make Krabby Patties. [Close-up of a patty, which has ketchup eyes and a smile, and a pickle bowtie.] Mr. Krabs: Oh, how lovely. Uh, may I borrow your son for just a moment? [takes Squidward to the other side of the kitchen, quieter] What is going on here, boy-o? Why is your mother in the kitchen? [shoves SpongeBob into the window] Just take a look at that crowd! [SpongeBob looks outside. The customers are eating the restaurant, a fish with a torch is burning the floor, and Scooter chases a kid with a knife and fork.] Fish: This is why I never go out to eat anymore! Mr. Krabs: [pulls SpongeBob in] Your mommy has no business at [points to her] my business. Send her home. SpongeBob: Oh, but Mr. Krabs, [pulls down calendar] the official employee calendar says it's... [the 8th day is circled, and a heart with \"Mom Day\" written in it and an arrow sticking through it is written on] Bring Your Mom to Work Day. Squidward: Ha, too bad I forgot. [waves hand] Boy, that would have been awful. Mr. Krabs: [shivers] Oh, it shivers me timbers to think what a disaster my mom would make if she was here. [both laugh] Squidward and Mr. Krabs: [laughing] Betsy and Mrs. Tentacles: [off-screen] Ahem! [Mr. Krabs' mother, Betsy, and Mrs. Tentacles are standing next to Margaret.] SpongeBob: [walks next to Margaret] Don't you worry, fellas. I invited your moms too. Mr. Krabs: What? [strained] How thoughtful of you, SpongeBob. Mrs. Tentacles: Well, we're here, [grabs Squidward's head] so stop your horseplay and show me what you do. [walks him out] Squidward: Mother, you're embarrassing me. Ow, ow, ow, ow! Mr. Krabs: [laughs, Betsy grabs his head and spins him around, then grabs him] Betsy: I don't know what you're chuckling about, Eugene. There's wasted money everywhere I look! [sticks her finger in the deep fryer and tastes it] When was the last time you changed the oil in this fryer? SpongeBob: We change it every day, ma'am. Betsy: [points at him] Waste! Should be but once a year. [tastes ketchup, spits it back in] Real tomato ketchup. Waste! I bet in your latrine you use two-ply toilet paper. Mr. Krabs: Ha, we use [holds up one finger] one -ply. Betsy: As if it grows on trees. Waste! It should be half -ply. Your profits would be much higher if you stopped spending willy-nilly. Mr. Krabs: [looks down] Yes, Mama. [Cut to Squidward at the register boat. His mom comes up to him.] Mrs. Tentacles: Remember to smile, son. Squidward: [growls, forces a smile] Old Man Jenkins: [walks to register] Where's my food? Squidward: [still smiling] I'm sorry for the delay, sir. Your order will be up soon. Mrs. Tentacles: I didn't say lose your disdain. Squidward: [growls, leans forward] Mrs. Tentacles: And don't slouch. You'll ruin your spine. Squidward: I'm an invertebrate, Mother! Mrs. Tentacles: [duct tapes his back to a board] And no back talk. Squidward: [forced smile, unhappy] Yes, Mother. Mrs. Tentacles: Nice disdain. But save it for the customers. Squidward: [sighs] [Margaret comes out of the kitchen with a tray that has a potted flower, Krabby Patty, and fries with lettuce.] Margaret: [humming] Order up for Old Man Jenkins. One Krabby Patty with crust removed and one side salad. Old Man Jenkins: I ordered fries, not a salad! Margaret: The fries are in the salad. Old Man Jenkins: Okay, I'll try it. [takes it] But only 'cause I'm so hungry. [tastes it, spins around and is now wearing a kid outfit] Aha! Customers: Ooh! Old Man Jenkins: It reminds me of my mother's cooking when I was but a boy. I'm filled with childish glee! [giggles and skips away] Margaret: Mm! [smiles, walks away, revealing SpongeBob behind her back with a tray of Krabby Patties] SpongeBob: I made everyone's orders! [spins the tray to send Krabby Patties into customers' mouths] Customers: [catch food] SpongeBob: My mom doesn't understand fast food--not the way I do. Her cooking takes forever, because she adds love. Brown fish: [eating patty, then stops and tears up] You mean there's no love in this Krabby Patty? Now all I taste is the fast. [stands up on table, throws patty at Old Man Walker] I demand a refund! Customers: [hold up signs, angry clamoring] We want a refund! Mr. Krabs: [exits kitchen] Okay, that's enough. There'll be no refunds. You see, there is love here. My love for your money! [heart thumps, kisses dollar bill] Mwah. [holds bill closer] You don't want to break us up, do ya? Customers: No, we don't! / Where's the love? / Give me my money back! / No love, no purchase! [Mrs. Tentacles scratches her fingernail against a blackboard to get everyone's attention.] Mrs. Tentacles: Clearly, our sons aren't working hard enough. Believe me when I say no one is more disappointed than we, their mothers. Margaret: We thought we taught them better. Betsy: To avert this disaster, we're going to take over the restaurant and show our boys how it's done! [shakes fist] Mr. Krabs: But Mama! Betsy: Zip it! [points] And to the shame corner with you three. SpongeBob, Squidward, Krabs: Aww... [they walk under a sign labeled \"Shame Corner\".] Mrs. Tentacles: Now, time to spruce this place up! [Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab sign, which now reads \"Mama Krabs Home-Style Cooking\" with an illustration of Betsy holding a pie.] Mr. Krabs: \"Mama Krabs Home-style Cooking\"? [looking out window] This is gonna be a disaster. Look at what they did to me restaurant! [the interior is decorated with tiled floors, fancy curtains, and general homey decorations] SpongeBob: I think the place looks [hugs self] homey. Mr. Krabs: If I wanted [makes air quotes] \"homey,\" [points backwards] I'd stay at home! [despairingly] This is costing me a fortune. [cash register dings] [Margaret comes in carrying two large stacks of plates as Betsy holds the door open.] Betsy: Actually, Mrs. SquarePants had all this stuff in the trunk of her boat. Margaret: [moves plates] A mother is always prepared! Mr. Krabs: [sneakily] Eventually, our moms will crash and burn. And then we'll reclaim the Krusty Krab. Squidward: [smiles] Looks like it's gonna happen sooner than later. Look who just [squishes SpongeBob down and points] arrived! [Bubble Bass knocks the door open with his stomach.] Squidward: Bubble Bass! Mr. Krabs: Every mom's nightmare! Mama Bass: [holds out a Mermaid Man action figure] Bubby, you forgot your doll on the boat. Bubble Bass: Mom! It's an [takes it back] action figure, not a doll! Mr. Krabs: We're doomed. Betsy: [seating Mama Bass and Bubble Bass] Welcome to Mama Krabs'. Right this way. [Bubble Bass puts the Mermaid Man figure on the other open chair.] Betsy: [gives them menus] Here's your menus. Bubble Bass: Interesting. [looks at menu] We shall see if this new management can stand up to [points to self] my scrutiny. [closes eyes, holds up finger] I will have one of every-- [Mama Bass slaps his menu out of his hands] huh? Ow! Mama Bass: We'll both have the early-bird special. Bubble Bass: Mother, I'm going to get a soda. [slams fist on table and runs to soda machine, fills soda and hums happily, puts a straw in it, gets caught by a grabber] Hmm? [yelps, gets pulled back to Mama Bass with a leash, exasperated] Mooom! Mama Bass: [drops Bubble Bass in his seat, picks up straw] Soda straws are dangerous. You'll put your [pokes his eye with it] eye out. [puts a rubber baby bottle cap on the soda cup] Use this instead. Bubble Bass: [excited, gasps] Ooh! Ba-ba! [hides it] I mean, uh, so embarrassing. [burps, leans against table] Margaret: [walking up, holding food] Here you go! Bubble Bass: Ooh! Margaret: Two Krabby Patty casseroles. [places them, Bubble Bass and Mama Bass smile] I even cut it into bite-sized pieces. Mama Bass: That's just how my boy likes it. Margaret: Enjoy! [walks away, they start eating] Squidward: Of course that mama's boy would like it here. SpongeBob: [nervously] Uh, guys? [happy] Look! [Many happy customers are in the restaurant, either seated or waiting in line.] SpongeBob: It seems like everyone is liking it here! Customers: [contented chatter] [A man trips and spills his food, which Margaret vacuums up and gives him a new one. Mrs. Tentacles, at the register, has a half-full tip jar and spits on a napkin, then wipes a customer's cheek.] Mrs. Tentacles: You've got some smudge. Brown fish: Danke! [puts lots of money in the tip jar] Mr. Krabs: I don't believe it. They're a success! SpongeBob: Well, of course they are. Look how hard they're working. Squidward: I actually feel kind of guilty seeing them do all the work. Bubble Bass: [drinking soda from lid] How pathetic. You three clearly don't know how to appreciate the [hugs soda cup] smothering embrace of motherly love. Squidward: [leans forward, grumpy] And what do you suggest? Bubble Bass: Are these premises equipped with a basement? [SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, Squidward, and Bubble Bass go down to the basement.] Mr. Krabs: All right, here we are. [turns on lights, shows a bunch of junk in the room] Bubble Bass: Gentlemen, I present, [grabs SpongeBob and Squidward] the fortress of solitude for [leans towards them] adult children. [jumps over the stair railing] Squidward: It's a junk-filled basement. Bubble Bass: Oh, you see \"junk.\" I see-- [drapes sheet over some crates and a chest, pushes up a chair] SpongeBob: [gasps, bounces off couch and onto chair] A hangout lounge! Bubble Bass: Correct. Mr. Krabs: Well, it's better than the shame corner. Squidward: I guess. Bubble Bass: [relaxes on sacks] Down here, you can spend your time doing whatever you want. Reading comics, playing video games, [mimes typing something and sending it] complaining on the Internet. [dolphin chirps] Squidward: Your life choices are lame, but I like the overall concept. [Squidward and Mr. Krabs sit down] Bubble Bass: And with your mother upstairs, snacks are just a holler away. SpongeBob: Ooh, my mom loves to make snacks. What else can you teach us, oh [makes \"OK\" signs with fingers] wise sage of the [relaxes] slacker ways? Bubble Bass: [sits up] Alas, my time with you is at an end. [points to self] I have been a good boy, and my mother is taking me for ice cream in three, two, one... [yelps, gets pulled back by the leash] I'm ready for my ice cream, Mommy! Mama Bass: [leaves] Bye, girls! Betsy: Come back soon, you hear! [Cut back to SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs and Squidward in the basement.] Mr. Krabs: Well, I guess we can give it a try. [clears throat] Mo-om! [Live-action nachos fall down the screen to show SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs playing a video game. Mrs. Tentacles comes in and puts a bowl of popcorn downstairs.] Squidward: [groans, moves controller] [Squidward throws his controller and Mr. Krabs celebrates.] Mr. Krabs: [laughs] [Transition to Krabs and Squidward playing darts. Krabs throws one. SpongeBob is taped up to a dartboard with an apple on his head, and he moves his legs to avoid the dart. Transition to them all playing a fantasy board game.] Mr. Krabs: [calling out] Mom! Nachos! [Betsy comes in and brings them nachos, to their delight. Transition to SpongeBob and Mr.  Krabs having a pillow fight. SpongeBob's pillow flies and hits a pillow fort, which Squidward comes out of.] Squidward: Hey, watch the fort! [Betsy, Margaret, and Mrs. Tentacles come down and up the stairs with various snacks as their sons call out for them.] SpongeBob: Mom! Mr. Krabs: Ma! Squidward: Mom! SpongeBob: Mom! Mr. Krabs: Mom! Squidward: Mom! SpongeBob: Mom! [Margaret puts a plate of toaster pastries on a crate. Mrs. Tentacles puts a bowl of popcorn on a barrel. The moms fill cups of lemonade and put baby bottle caps over them.] Mr. Krabs: Mom! Squidward: Hey, Ma! [A clock fades from evening to morning. SpongeBob is sleeping on a barrel, Mr. Krabs is asleep on the couch and Squidward, who has drawings on his face, is in a sleeping bag.] SpongeBob: [snoring] Mom. Mr. Krabs: [snoring] Mommy, Mommy, Mommy. Squidward: [snoring] Mommy, Mommy. [They all wake up.] Mr. Krabs: I've never slept better in me life. Last night made me feel like a kid again. Squidward: [exhales] So that's what it's like to have a childhood. SpongeBob: Aww, you guys are the best buddies a kid could ever have. Mr. Krabs: [stomach rumbles] I'm hungry. [calling out] Mom, breakfast! [Shot of the stairwell. It's empty, as crickets chirp.] SpongeBob: Guys, I think something's wrong. Mr. Krabs: Agreed, lad. We better go check. [They open the kitchen door to see a bunch of dads: fixing the clock, playing football, playing cards, napping on a recliner, carving a canoe, grilling, and hanging out with a pickup truck. One dad throws a football at his son, and a buff guy tackles him.] Tackled guy: [teeth fall out, raises fist] Booyah! Mr. Krabs: What in tarnation? Who are all these bums? Harold: Hey, kids! [SpongeBob's, Squidward's and Mr. Krabs' dads are sitting in chairs and watching TV.] Krabs Senior: Oh, there you are, Eugene. Go fix me one of those Krabbity Patties you're always going on about. SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Dad? SpongeBob: Oh! [pulls up calendar] That's right! [on the calendar, Mom Day is crossed off and Dad Day is circled on the 9th, with an illustration of a car on it] Today is Bring Your Dad to Work Day. Harold: [holds out drink] Oh, uh, while you're up, son, could you refill my drink? Jeff Tentacles: [holds out bowl] And more chips for me, kid. Krabs Senior: Any time you're ready with that Krabbity Patty, son. Mr. Krabs: I want my mommy! [Mr. Krabs' eyes retract into his shell, SpongeBob sucks his thumb while whimpering, and Squidward assumes a fetal position as the episode concludes.]"
