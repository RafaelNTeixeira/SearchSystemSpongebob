  "synopsis": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob goes over to Patrick's house so they can play a game of golf. However, before their game can begin, it starts to rain. Patrick tries to tell the rain to stop, but he winds up getting struck by lightning and screams. While hearing the noise outside, Squidward opens his window and tells them to keep it at a low rumble. While it is raining outside, SpongeBob and Patrick decide to build a golf course in SpongeBob's house. While they are building, the noise wakes Squidward up. Squidward tells SpongeBob and Patrick to not make any more noise \"Or else.\" Patrick does everything he can to distract SpongeBob and make him lose. SpongeBob and Patrick's golf balls smash through SpongeBob's window after they hit them too hard and land right in Squidward's window.SpongeBob decides to end the game, but Patrick ignores him and enters Squidward's house to look for his ball. While searching, Patrick stops to rummage through Squidward's fridge and eats most of his food including some kelp salad, only to discover he has also eaten SpongeBob's ball, which was hiding in it. SpongeBob offers to get the ball out, but he declines and tells Patrick he has to \"play the ball where it lands.\" After hitting his ball out of Patrick's body, Patrick finds his ball stuck in his bum, SpongeBob reminds him again that he must \"play it where it lands.\" Patrick gets a hole in one and SpongeBob tells him he could do it blindfolded, so Patrick hands him a blindfold. Patrick helps SpongeBob find his ball by playing hot or cold, but since SpongeBob cannot see, he accidentally breaks Squidward's furniture and paintings. It turns out Patrick also took a shower in Squidward's bathroom while accidentally giving SpongeBob bad directions. Finally annoyed with Patrick's laziness, SpongeBob drags him out and they go off to search the house.They soon find both balls have landed in Squidward's room, Patrick's golf ball is on Squidward's head and SpongeBob's golf ball is in his mouth. Just as they are about to hit their balls, Squidward wakes up and screams as SpongeBob hits his golf ball out along with Squidward's dentures. SpongeBob and Patrick both get a hole in one and leave Squidward's house, planning to have a rematch next Saturday. The episode ends with Squidward's house collapsing and falling apart to the ground, while crushing him.",

  "transcript": "[SpongeBob's alarm rings, his house blows toward Squidward's house, Squidward wakes up in dread, sand hands then cover the house's ears, then SpongeBob, in brown plaid, poses for one second then runs to Patrick's house.] SpongeBob: Patrick! Tee time, Patrick! Patrick! [cuts to Squidward] Tee time, Patrick! [cuts to Patrick's house] Patrick! Wake up! Patrick: [laughs] Ready to lose? Weather permitting, of course. [There is a rumbling sound then storm clouds move in and start rain and thunder] SpongeBob: Aw, how are we supposed to golf in this this downpour? Our putters are getting waterlogged. [twists his putter] Patrick: Dumb rain! Doesn't it know I'm the sheriff in these parts? [points to sky with his putter] Hey, rain! You better stop that! [gets shocked by lightning then screams. Cuts to Squidward grumbling and covers his head with a blanket] Patrick: [continues screaming then gets burned to ashes] Aah! Squidward: [opens the window] If you two don't mind, could you keep it down to a low rumble? SpongeBob and Patrick: Sorry, Squidward. SpongeBob: I guess we were just too upset about the rain and how... Squidward: Don't care. [closes the window, cuts to SpongeBob's house] SpongeBob: [sighs] I was really looking forward to a day of sportsmanship and male bonding. Thanks a lot, rain! [slams his fist onto the table and makes his golf ball ricochet off of the door then Gary into Gary's food bowl] Hey, [raises his finger] That gives me an idea. [A Brief Construction Montage time card appears] French Narrator: What follows is a brief construction montage. [The montage shows SpongeBob and Patrick hammering on boards, ripping a sofa, pouring sand, drilling holes, filling holes with water, making holes, and taking Gary's shell off. The Brief Construction Montage time card reappears.] French Narrator: We hope you enjoyed this brief construction montage. [Cuts to outside of house, with sounds and SpongeBob's house shaking. Cuts to inside of Squidward's house.] Squidward: [grumbles, then gets so angry his sleep mask burns off, puts three pillows on a desk, ties them to his face with a rope, still hears them, then rips the pillows off and screams. He walks to SpongeBob's house with umbrella, cuts to inside, where SpongeBob and Patrick are constructing] Hey! Hello? Nitwit, morons. [Patrick accidentally hits Squidward with a hammer, Squidward screams] SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Squidward. Up from your slumber, I see. Well, you're just in time to endure in a friendly game of [shows course] indoor miniature golf! Squidward: I will not indulge in anything friendly or otherwise with the likes of you two. And presently, I am heading to enjoy a well-deserved morning nap. Patrick: But we sculpted your likeness out of butter on hole five. [cuts to sculpture] Squidward: I don't care! Listen up, I will not be woken from my nap again, and if I am, I'm gonna... Patrick: Join us on the back nine? Squidward: Just don't let it happen again! Or else. [leaves] SpongeBob: Let's get this game teed off. [balls come out of his head, he catches them, places a ball and tee on grass] You're up first, my good man. [Patrick stretches, yawns, stomps, ululates] Squidward: I am warning you two, keep it down! SpongeBob: Better tone down the calisthenics, Patrick. Don't wanna upset Squidward. Patrick: Can't wait to lose, huh? [aims, pulls back, and shoots. Ball rolls back to tee] No! Ooh. If you would just let me finish my stretches, I wouldn't have missed my first shot! SpongeBob: Oh, don't worry, Patrick, I'm sure you'll get the hang of it. [places ball on tee] Besides, we're just playin' for fun, right? And back, and- [makes it] Patrick: Nice shot. [moves his ball] SpongeBob: What are you doing? Patrick: Moving my ball. SpongeBob: Patrick, you have to play it where it lands. Patrick: Fine. Have it your way. [moves the ball back to original place, shoots, makes it] Ready to give up? [cuts to a hole] Patrick: Ha! Let's see how you do against the windmill. You haven't got a chance. SpongeBob: You know, Patrick, this is just a game. Patrick: Oh, it is just a game, which I am gonna win. SpongeBob: I think you're missing the point. [aims, practice shots] Patrick: Speaking of m-m-missing! [SpongeBob shoots by accident, startled by Patrick] Ha! Gotta play it where it lands. Watch and learn, SquarePants. Watch and learn. [shoots and makes it] Yes! See if you can top that! SpongeBob: [uneasily] Okay. Patrick: [with microphone and headphones] SpongeBob readies the approach shot. He's gotta be very careful he doesn't hook the shot here, because this would certainly be an inopportune time for a bogey. [SpongeBob swings but stops] A pressure-packed shot to be sure. [leaves] [SpongeBob sweats and wipes his forehead, shoots, ball stops right before it's about to go in] Bikini Bottomites: Aw. [all whisper] [cuts to hole] Patrick: Looks like we're tied, three shots to three. SpongeBob: Shots. [chuckles] They're called strokes in golf, Patrick. Not shots. Patrick: Whatever. [shoots and makes it] And he sinks another hole in one! That's two in a row! SpongeBob: All right. You wanna play competitive, eh? Observe. [shoots and makes it] Right between the old wickets. Come on bally, don't fail me now. Patrick: Watch out for the water hazard. SpongeBob: Patrick, the only hazard I can see is you standing in my shot. Patrick: I have no idea what you're talking about. SpongeBob: Fine. Be that way. I'll just go around you. [shoots the ball an ball ricochets off of a picture, through the head of the Squidward butter sculpture and out the window] Oops. Patrick: Show-off. I can do that. [shoots, SpongeBob ducks and goes out the window] SpongeBob: Oh, where did our balls go? Patrick: Well, how do I know? I was just copying you. SpongeBob: [shows the side of Squidward's house and broken window] Uh-oh. Oh well, I guess that's game point. Patrick: Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho, hold on there, fella. It's not over yet. SpongeBob: But remember what Squidward said? We can't make any noise! Patrick: Who said anything about noise? We're just gonna get outta the rough and back to the course! SpongeBob: Hey! Patrick. [Patrick is shown eating Squidward's kelp salad] Patrick! What's the big idea? I thought we were in here to play golf, remember? Patrick: Okay, okay! SpongeBob: Now where is that darn ball? Patrick: Oh! SpongeBob: Patrick, have you seen by ball? Patrick: Was it a red one? SpongeBob: Mm-hmm. Patrick: It might have been in the kelp salad. SpongeBob: Patrick, you ate my ball? Patrick: Don't worry, I'll get it. SpongeBob: Patrick, no! Patrick: No? SpongeBob: I have to play the ball where it lies. [goes inside Patrick and opens his mouth] You'll need to leave this open. [goes back inside] Now, let's see, if I was a golf ball, where would I-oh! Next to the gallbladder, of course. Fore! [the ball goes through wall and hits the lamp] Where's your ball? Patrick: I don't know. Gotta be around here somewhere. [the ball is seen on Patrick's butt on the outside of his pants] SpongeBob: There it is! Patrick: Uh-oh. SpongeBob: Play it where it lies. Patrick: [angrily grumbling. Cuts to him shooting it and ricocheting off a cabinet to a overhead desk lamp, picture, and through a wall] Hole in one! Top that! SpongeBob: I could do that blindfolded. [Patrick hands him a blindfold] [cuts to blind SpongeBob. He hits a door. Feels around to identify it and slams the door] Patrick: Wait up! Warmer. Warmer. Red hot! SpongeBob: [slams a door] Aha! Patrick: Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hotter. Red hot! Red hot! [SpongeBob splits a table] Wait, My mistake. You're ice cold. Oh, Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hot. Red hot. Red hot! Smoking hot! [kills a plant] Wrong again. SpongeBob: Patrick... [peeks out] Patrick: Stop peeking! Hotter. [wrecks Squidward's house along the way] Colder! Hotter! Hot! Cold. Hot! Cold. Hot! Cool. Hot! Cold. SpongeBob: Patrick! [takes the blindfold off] This is ridi- [sees Squidward's wrecked house] -culous. Wow. Squidward's really let this place go. Patrick! Patrick: [in shower] Aah! SpongeBob: What are you doing? Patrick: I was just freshening up. These fancy fixtures are touchy. [turns fixture] [steam builds up around Patrick] Hot! Red hot! Ah! Cold! Cold! SpongeBob: Would you please get back in the game? Patrick: But I wanted to try his loofah. SpongeBob: Those balls have gotta be around here somewhere. Oh, Patrick. Patrick: Uhh, look a little closer, buddy. SpongeBob: [uneasily] Play it where it lies? Patrick: Play it where it lies. SpongeBob: But how are we gonna hit our balls back to my house from here? Patrick: All it takes is a little finesse, SpongeBob. All it takes is a little finesse. SpongeBob: Okay, you're good to go. Patrick: Fore! [wrecks top front of house] It's all yours. SpongeBob: This one's for all the marbles. Patrick: But I thought we weren't betting. SpongeBob: No, I mean whoever wins this hole wins the game. [Squidward wakes up and takes off his blindfold to see SpongeBob and Patrick talking] Squidward: [muffled] What's going on here? [screams] [SpongeBob and Patrick shoot, landing Gary's food bowl, spilling on him] SpongeBob and Patrick: Hole in one! [Squidward sits up] SpongeBob: [softly] Good morning. Patrick: Sorry we woke you. Squidward: [muffled and stammering] Wha-What? [his mouth is shown, with no dentures] SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, what happened to your dentures? [Cuts to Gary, with dentures in his bowl.] Patrick: Good game, pal. SpongeBob: Rematch next Saturday? Patrick: Rain or shine, SpongeBob. Rain or shine. [stops raining, focusing on Squidward's house, which collapses.] Squidward: [muffled] SpongeBob?!",

  "transcript": "[The episode begins with a morning at Conch Street. Squidward is coming out of his house with a bunch of stuff.] Squidward: [sighs] One glorious week [pulls out his keys] without those two... [Suddenly, SpongeBob and Patrick appear under the RV.] SpongeBob: Hey! [Squidward steps on SpongeBob and Patrick and twirls until he, SpongeBob, and Patrick fly into the air.] Squidward: [yelling] ...Idiots! SpongeBob and Patrick: Hi, Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick land safely on the ground, but Squidward injures himself and his stuff falls on him. SpongeBob walks towards Squidward.] SpongeBob: Hold on, Squidward! [SpongeBob pulls Squidward out by grabbing his head. Eventually, SpongeBob manages to get Squidward, then SpongeBob gets tangled on Squidward's tentacles. Patrick walks to SpongeBob and Squidward as he pulls one of Squidward's tentacles to get SpongeBob out.] You should be more careful. Patrick: Tisk, tisk, tisk! Squidward: Would you two go away and stop ruining my vacation?! SpongeBob: Vacation? Gee, I didn't think Mr. Krabs gave us any vacations. [Squidward pushes SpongeBob and Patrick away from him.] Squidward: I found someone to cover for me. [We cut to the inside of the Krusty Krab where Old Man Walker is at register boat for taking Squidward's side.] Old Man Walker: One Krabby Patty coming up, sir. [Old Man Walker tries to work the cash register. He presses the button that opens and sends himself straight through the window to the kitchen. Cut back at Conch Street where Squidward is putting his case and sack on the top of his RV.] SpongeBob: Where are you going on your vacation, Squidward? Squidward: If you must know, I'm going to Porpoise Peak to bask in the melodious sounds of the Warbling Water Lily. [A cloud appears and shows the Warbling Water Lily. Imagination SpongeBob and Patrick appear and whiteness the Warbling Water Lily. A clock appears in the sky and the big hand points at the 500.] Which only blooms once every five hundred years. [The cloud pops and Imagination SpongeBob and Patrick come out small. Squidward grabs them.] And I'm going alone. [He smacks the mini SpongeBob and Patrick together and the mini Patrick runs up to SpongeBob and Patrick as Patrick puts the mini Patrick in his pocket.] SpongeBob: I know! [quickly runs back with a different outfit and a case] Patrick and I will come along, and we can all be alone together. Squidward: Oh no, you're not messing up my vacation. [picks up SpongeBob's case and slams it on him] Now beat it! If I don't get moving, I'm gonna miss it. [walks to get himself packed and ready] SpongeBob: [pops out of the case with Squidward's shirt on] Oh, we'll help you pack. Squidward: No way, you idiots will just break... [But SpongeBob and Patrick didn't break anything. They got Squidward's stuff packed.] ...everything? [impressed] Oh. Patrick: Hold it! [steps off the RV and falls] We forgot to pack this. [points at the ramp] [Patrick uses his mouth to pull the ramp off of the RV. SpongeBob hops off the RV and helps Patrick to pull the ramp off. They both pull it off until it hits Patrick's face. Patrick then laughs.] Squidward: What? No, don't! Stop! [Suddenly, the RV drives off. Squidward screams in terror as he watches his RV drive off in the distance. He runs off after it and pushes SpongeBob and Patrick over. Squidward then stops and watches the RV drive off. SpongeBob and Patrick shows up and watch it too. The RV drives off through traffic, then it hits a sign that reads \"Bridge Out.\" The RV then drives through two rings of fire and passes by an octopus' arm. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward worry that the RV would crash until it finally stops.] SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Phew. [But as soon as they are relieved that the RV stopped, an anchor smashes the RV, causing it to explode. Squidward becomes utter shocked that his RV is destroyed thanks to SpongeBob and Patrick. Now he can't see the warbling water lily.] Patrick: You could buff that out. [Squidward gets angry and ink splatters out of his head.] Squidward: [to Patrick] How could?!... [to SpongeBob] Why would?!... [stutters] I can't believe it! [Squidward has angered out words until he turns sad. A tire is on fire and starts wheeling towards SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward.] I'll never see the warbling water-lily bloom now. [Squidward then walks to his house and bangs his head on the door to open it. Squidward then enters his house all sad and closes his door, now that his chances of seeing the warbling water lily are shattered. SpongeBob and Patrick feel ashamed of themselves of what they have done: They ruined Squidward's hopes of seeing the warbling water lily. SpongeBob and Patrick begin to feel bad for Squidward as he walks to his house.] SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh. Poor Squidward. SpongeBob: [gets an idea] Oh! I have an idea. Patrick: Really? What's that like? [Inside Squidward's bedroom, Squidward is getting ready for bed. He is still angry at SpongeBob and Patrick for ruining his hopes on seeing the warbling water lily.] Squidward: Little monsters. They oughta be locked up. Throw away the key and then... [snores] Locked up and throw them away. [Squidward dreams that he is at Porpoise Peak seeing the warbling water lily. Squidward drives his RV, then sings and dances to two warbling water lilies. He smells them until the warbling water lilies open and reveals to be SpongeBob and Patrick. They start laughing, a purple shadow background shows. Squidward wakes up from his sleep and screams in horror. He is now in SpongeBob's house.] Oh, oh, phew. It was only a nightmare. [The camera zooms out revealing SpongeBob and Patrick. Squidward looks at SpongeBob and screams, he then looks at Patrick then screams as well. SpongeBob and Patrick both scream as Squidward screams. Squidward grabs their mouths.] SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward. Squidward: [pulls them over] Would you get out of my bedroom?! SpongeBob: [laughs] We're not in your bedroom, silly. [Squidward notices his bed is in SpongeBob's living room. He quickly jumps off of his bed.] Squidward: What? How did I get here? SpongeBob: Patrick and I mo- Squidward: [covers SpongeBob's mouth] Actually, I don't care. [leaves to get out of SpongeBob's house] Goodbye, SpongeB- [Just as Squidward was about to leave, he falls out of SpongeBob's door, which his house is now an RV. Squidward quickly gets back inside SpongeBob's house, he then notices two-passenger seats and a steering wheel. Squidward notices SpongeBob's house is an RV.] SpongeBob, why is your house... [screaming] driving on the road?! Patrick: Because we turned it into a RV! SpongeBob: We didn't want you to miss that flower blooming. Squidward: Okay. Hold on. Who's driving? Patrick: It's on autosnail. [Gary is shown driving and is being distracted by his toy.] Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Come on, let's get breakfast. [takes Squidward's hand] [Bubble transition to the kitchen where Patrick and Squidward are sitting. Patrick is laughing while he has a knife and fork in his hand. SpongeBob tosses three coffee mugs, three plates, and coffee on the table. He then walks to the table with two stacks of pancakes. Squidward smells them.] Squidward: Hey, this looks pretty good. [All of a sudden, unbeknownst to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward, the RV drives over a wobbly damaged bridge. Squidward is about to eat his pancakes, but the plates slide off due to the RV on the bridge. Squidward tries to eat his pancakes again but misses again. The RV wobbles onto the bridge. Finally, Squidward reaches his pancakes with his fork. Squidward is about to eat his pancakes, but the RV drives into a bump on the bridge. Squidward accidentally eats all the pancakes at once and chokes on them. He then spits the pancakes out in front of Patrick.] Patrick: [points at the pancakes] Are you gonna eat that? [The RV is off the bridge, which causes it to break. Gary is shown tired from driving so much.] SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, let's give Gary a break. Patrick: Disengaging autosnail! [presses a button to give the toy to Gary] [Gary starts chewing on his toy while Patrick takes his place.] Gary: [chewing on his toy] Meow, meow, meow, meow. Patrick: Let's see what this pineapple can do! [Patrick presses on the brakes and drives faster, which it follows him running over a \"Road Closed\" sign and drives to the mountain. Squidward notices how high they are and sees a bunch of boats all damaged.] On the road! Squidward: [gulps] We gotta get off this road! Patrick: No problem. [Patrick then press a button which activates rocket boosters from the back of the RV. He drives off very fast on five roads. Patrick is driving so fast it sends Squidward off his seat and slams on the wall. He then notices SpongeBob next to him.] SpongeBob: Oh! Hi, Squidward. Squidward: [screams] I'm not here! This isn't happening! [Suddenly, the RV drives on the steepest hill and up a ramp. It then flies in mid-air. Inside the RV, Squidward floating in mid-air as the RV is flying. Squidward grabs onto a door and accidentally opens it. A bunch of SpongeBob's stuff comes out of his door. Squidward misses it, but gets hit by a safe. SpongeBob is watching TV, which is floating along with his couch and chair. Gary is still chewing on his toy while floating as well. Patrick begins to float too. The RV lands on the road which they arrive at Porpoise Peak. Squidward hits through the sign. SpongeBob exits out of his house.] SpongeBob: [laughs cheerfully] We're here! Squidward: [shakes his head] Huh? [Squidward gasps as he sees the warbling water lily.] The warbling water lily! [pulls out his camera and runs towards the flower] Oh, so beautiful! And I have it all to my... [Suddenly, a group of people show up to see the flower and start taking pictures.] Ow! My back! [Squidward moves a few people out of his way, so he can take a picture of the flower, but it suddenly disappears.] Huh? Where is it? [Patrick comes up with the warbling water lily.] Patrick: Is this that babbling buttercup you were looking for? [Patrick gives Squidward the flower as everyone looks in surprise. The flower then sprouts out, a light glows right before Squidward's eyes and starts playing music. But all of a sudden, the flower starts to dry out. Everyone gasps in complete shocked. Squidward is shocked to see that the flower as dried out as well. Everyone gets angry at Squidward and starts attacking him. SpongeBob walks towards the flower and notices how dry out it is. The fishes take Squidward and bury him into the ground and leave. Monroe comes up with a watering can and waters Squidward out of the ground like a flower. SpongeBob and Patrick come up to Squidward and SpongeBob smell his head. Squidward comes out and gets rid of the dirt.] Squidward: Well, that's one more vacation down the drain. May as well go home. SpongeBob: [laughs] Well, we got a long drive ahead of us. [pulls toilet paper out of his pore] We better go before go if you know what I mean-o. Patrick: [laughs] Not really. SpongeBob: Now, Squidward, don't leave without us. [laughs and leaves] Squidward: [gets an idea] Huh? Of course not! Only a monster would leave you behind. [Squidward grins evilly and eventually, he leaves them behind, driving the RV.] So I'm a monster. [whistles] They'll be fine. Alone. [begins to sweat] On top of a mountain. In the middle of nowhere. [But Squidward stops the RV, realizing that he can't leave SpongeBob and Patrick behind.] D'oh, I can't do it! [Squidward reverses back to get SpongeBob and Patrick. We cut back to the woods where SpongeBob and Patrick are finished using the bathroom. Patrick has toilet paper all over him.] SpongeBob: Hey, you're really getting the hang of using toilet paper, Patrick. Patrick: And next week, I'm starting on two-ply. SpongeBob: I'll get another roll from the RV. [SpongeBob walks towards to the RV, but to find that it's gone, due to Squidward leaving them behind.] Hey, where is the RV? Patrick: [points] Well, maybe those guys have seen it. Hey, hey! Have you seen our pineapple? [A group of sea bears, like the ones from \"The Camping Episode,\" show up and growl at Patrick. We cut back to Squidward still driving the RV to get SpongeBob and Patrick. He then parks the RV and looks for SpongeBob and Patrick. All of a sudden, SpongeBob and Patrick\u2019s screams are heard.] Squidward: Oh no, I'm too late! [Squidward runs to a cave and karate chops one of the sea bears.] Don't you dare eat those morons! [But instead of hearing screaming, SpongeBob and Patrick were laughing and tickling the sea bears.] SpongeBob: Squidward, they weren't eating us. Patrick: We were just having a tickle fight. [laughs] SpongeBob: Sea bears love it when you tickle their bellies. Patrick: [laughs] But they hate it when you karate chop their hineys. Squidward: [realizing what he has done while the sea bears growl at him] Uh, tickle, tickle? [The sea bears begin to attack and maul Squidward.] SpongeBob: Squidward, they'll leave you alone if you play dead! Patrick: [pulls out a tombstone that says \"RIP Squidward\" and throws it at Squidward] This will help! Catch! [The tombstone hits Squidward's head while he is being mauled to death. The sea bears stop mauling Squidward and leaves.] SpongeBob: Bye. Call me. You got my number. [Bubble transition to Conch Street where the RV bumps into Squidward's house and parks. SpongeBob kicks open the door.] Wow! Was that a fun road trip or was that a fun road trip? [Patrick comes out of the RV and spins in the air of excitement.] Patrick: The funnerest! [Squidward walks up out of the RV with bandages on him after being attacked by sea bears.] Squidward: More like the worst road trip. My one chance to hear the warbling water lily, and you ruined it! [falls out of the RV] SpongeBob: [chuckles] Are you sure about that, Squidward? [pulls out the flower] Ohh, poor thing just needs some love. [pours water into the pot and kisses it] Squidward: [gasps] The warbling water lily! [The warbling water lily begins to play.] So beautiful. [pulls out his clarinet and plays] SpongeBob: Oh, my ears! My ears! It hurts! It hurts! [SpongeBob breaks apart and Patrick's head explodes and screams.] We're so happy for you, Squidward! [They run back into the RV to escape from the racket.] Patrick: Engage autosnail! [The episode ends with SpongeBob and Patrick drive off as Squidward plays his clarinet with the warbling water lily.]",

  "synopsis": "It is Valentine's Day and SpongeBob is busy giving Valentines to all his friends. He is also working with Sandy to give Patrick a very special present - a hot-air balloon made of chocolate. SpongeBob tells Patrick he has a present prepared for him and Patrick is desperate to know what it is, but SpongeBob will not tell him to avoid ruining the surprise before Sandy arrives with it.SpongeBob takes Patrick to a Valentine's Day Carnival and Patrick thinks that this is the present, only to realize that it is not. As he tries to figure out what the present is, SpongeBob calls Sandy, who is flying the chocolate balloon to the carnival, and tells her about his curiousness. Unfortunately, a flock of ferocious chocolate-eating scallops attack her and she tells SpongeBob that she is going to be a little late. She tells him to bring Patrick up to the Ferris wheel and that she will meet him there.SpongeBob tells Patrick his present is on the Ferris wheel, and they position themselves at the top as planned. But Sandy is still not here yet so SpongeBob calls her; meanwhile at that moment, the scallops cause the balloon to lose air and derail her off-course, so she tells SpongeBob to switch to plan B. Therefore, SpongeBob is forced to lie about the gift and Patrick's present is limited to a \"friendly handshake,\" and he is grumpy for the rest of the day at the carnival. Later, the two are sitting on a bench, when everybody thanks SpongeBob for giving them presents. Consumed by anger and jealousy that a handshake is not the same as the others, Patrick goes berserk and wreaks havoc across the Valentine's Day Carnival.He ends up cornering several citizens, including SpongeBob, at a dead-end at the Goo Lagoon dock; while SpongeBob agrees he deserves it rather than the others, Patrick still claims he never got a gift from them and won't take it when they toss him valentines of their own. Just as he is about to attack everybody and the frightened SpongeBob braces for the inevitable, Sandy comes down just in time with the repaired chocolate balloon, having gotten the scallops to help her bring it to him. SpongeBob and the citizens desperately tell Patrick to turn around, but he does not budge. When Sandy greets him, he finally turns around and notices the chocolate balloon, recognizing it as his real valentine as SpongeBob presents it. He gets excited and jumps on the balloon, only to pop it when he eats it as it was a bubble. As the episode ends, Patrick gently tells SpongeBob that he didn't have to get him anything.",

  "transcript": "[The episode opens with a distant view of Patrick's, Squidward's, and SpongeBob's houses on Conch Street in front of the pink sky surrounded by a heart-shaped coral nearby.] SpongeBob: [opens his house door with a bunch of hearts in his arms] Happy Valentine's Day, Bikini Bottom! [throws hearts everywhere] [The hearts transition to SpongeBob handing a heart to Squidward, but he rudely tears it up. Another transition shows SpongeBob giving one to Mrs. Puff who likes the heart, but her boat runs into a fire hydrant. Another transition to a dejected Plankton walking into one of SpongeBob's shoes. SpongeBob gives him a tiny heart using tweezers, who seems surprised at the heart. Another transition shows SpongeBob leaping over to Sandy's treedome.] Sandy: Happy Valentine's Day, SpongeBob. I'm nuts for you. [gets out an heart-shaped acorn nut with an arrow stuck through it] SpongeBob: [puts the acorn away and takes out a bottle of chocolate syrup] Well, I'm bubbles for you, Sandy. [blows a chocolate heart bubble] Sandy: [opens a door on her helmet for the chocolate heart to go into, sticks her tongue out and closes her eyes, the chocolate heart lands and pops on her tongue as she eats it, and she licks her lips] Mmmm, chocolate. Mighty tasty. Patrick's gonna love the one you made for him. [A giant chocolate hot air balloon with a simple Patrick drawing on it is shown. SpongeBob and Sandy run over to the balloon. Sandy gets into the basket] Sandy: Take me through the plan again. SpongeBob: Okay. [blows a chocolate carnival] Step one: [manly voice] Patrick and I get to the Valentine's Day carnival. [a chocolate SpongeBob and Patrick fly in and hop onto the carnival] [regular voice] Step two: [manly voice] I position Patrick and myself on top of the Ferris wheel. [both of them hop over to the Ferris wheel where it rides up to the top. Blows a chocolate hot air balloon] [regular voice] Step three: [manly voice] You arrive at designated checkpoint for maximum visual contact. [the balloon floats over above the carnival] [regular voice] Step four: [manly voice] Patrick is thrilled. Mission accomplished. [Chocolate bursts all over the screen and transitions to Patrick with a Valentine's Day shirt and putting a big rock on the ground and pounds the rock into the shape of a heart and picks it up] SpongeBob: [walks up behind Patrick] Hi, Patrick. Patrick: [imagines the heart is talking to him] Hello? SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob. Patrick: SpongeBob, what are you doing in there? SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick: Oh, my gosh! Sponge...SpongeBob is stuck inside this rock! [screams] Hold on, buddy, I'll get you out! [smashes the rock into a pile of dirt] SpongeBob? SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Patrick... Patrick: SpongeBob! [cries and rubs the pile of dirt against the side of his face] SpongeBob...! SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm right behind you! [Patrick turns around] Patrick: There you are. [holds the pile of dirt in his hands] Happy Valentine's Day! Here's your present. SpongeBob: And I have a present for you! Patrick: You do? SpongeBob: It's the greatest... [Patrick gets excited] ...the bestest... [Patrick gets more excited] ...the most fantabulous... [Patrick gets even more excited] ...present ever! [bounces and rolls all around all excited and overjoyed] But you can't have it yet. [Patrick stops rolling and bouncing around] Patrick: Huh? Why not? SpongeBob: Because it's not ready yet. Patrick: Is it ready now? SpongeBob: Not yet. Patrick: How about now? SpongeBob: Do you want to ruin the surprise? Patrick: Yes! SpongeBob: Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh! Patrick: Oh, come on, please! SpongeBob: Hmmm...nope, sorry. Patrick: [grabs on to SpongeBob's legs and feet] You gotta tell me! SpongeBob: No can do! [laughs] You'll just have to wait! [walks off with Patrick still hanging on his legs and feet] Patrick: Please. Oh please... [still hanging on his legs we see SpongeBob walking through the middle of nowhere] ...please-please-please-please. Tell me-tell me-tell me. Please?! SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, here we are. Patrick: [gasps as he sees the carnival] You got me a carnival? Mine! All mine, mine, mine, mine. [runs inside the carnival and SpongeBob runs in behind him] Mine, mine, mine! All right, everybody out! This is my carnival! SpongeBob: It's not the carnival. Patrick: Oh. SpongeBob: [takes a quarter out of his pocket] Here, why don't you take this quarter and... Patrick: [snatches it from SpongeBob] Oh my gosh, a quarter! I've always wanted a quarter! SpongeBob: It's not the quarter. Patrick: Oh. SpongeBob: Now, take that quarter and buy some cotton candy... [Patrick interrupts and SpongeBob's finger deflates] Patrick: Cotton candy! I can't believe it! [chases the cotton candy seller] Cotton candy! Cotton Candy Seller: Hey, get away! Hey! Sandy: Sandy to SpongeBob. [SpongeBob takes out a walkie-talkie where Sandy's voice is coming from] Sandy to SpongeBob. Come in, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Ten-four, Sandy, SpongeBob here. [we see Sandy closing in with the balloon on the carnival] Sandy: [floating toward the carnival in the balloon] I got a visual on the carnival. You want me to bring her in? SpongeBob: Ohh, not yet, Sandy. Patrick's still trying to guess what his Valentine is. Sandy: [chuckles] You are such a kidder. Sandy out. That SpongeBob... [a group of orange flying oysters are heading toward the balloon] Scallops...chocolate-eating scallops! Patrick: So if it's not cotton candy, then what is it? I can't take it! SpongeBob: You'll have to guess! Patrick: [points at a tent] This tent? SpongeBob: No. Patrick: [holds up Incidental 111 who is waiting in line for Heart-A-Whirl] This guy? SpongeBob: No. [we see micro-organisms crawling around; it's Patrick's view through a microscope] Patrick: This paramecium? SpongeBob: [laughs] Nope. Patrick: [giggles] Heh, you're a sly one. I can't find here in the carnival...because it's on top of Mount 'Climb Up and Fall Off'. [runs up the mountain and falls off then runs back to SpongeBob] It wasn't there either! SpongeBob: Are you sure? [runs up the mountain and falls off again; SpongeBob uses his walkie-talkie to tell Sandy something] SpongeBob to Sandy, you can bring it in now. [Sandy is using a whip to shoo the scallops away] Sandy: Uhh, SpongeBob, we got ourselves a little problem. I got a pack of chocolate-eating scallops trying to rustle the balloon! Hi-yah! Get away, you sweet-toothed varmints! Hi-yah! I'm going to be a little late! SpongeBob: [gets worried] Late? But what about... [Patrick still jumping on and off mountain] ...Patrick? Sandy: Hing-ya! Take him up to the Ferris wheel and I'll meet you there! Sandy out! SpongeBob: [puts away the walkie-talkie] If Patrick doesn't get his valentine... [screams] Patrick: [suddenly appears from behind, all bruised] I'm pretty sure it's not up there, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Patrick! Uhh, actually it's on the Ferris... Patrick: Ferris wheel! [Patrick grabs SpongeBob and runs toward the Ferris wheel. Bubble transition to the two on the Ferris wheel being brought to the top.] Patrick: I'm ready for the greatest Valentine's present in the whole world now, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Well, this is where you're gonna get it...I hope. Just keep looking out there, pal. [SpongeBob talks to Sandy again on the walkie-talkie] SpongeBob to Sandy, SpongeBob to Sandy, come in, Sandy! [Sandy is still fighting the chocolate eating scallops] Sandy: Sandy to SpongeBob, I got my ox in a ditch here! I'm way off course! The scallops are eating the balloon! They're everywhere! [One scallop bites the balloon and the air goes out and it floats down] Aw, shoot! We're going down, SpongeBob! Switch to plan B! SpongeBob: [shocked] No, no, B, Sandy! \"[but his walkie-talkie goes static]\" No, B! Noooo! D'oh! [Patrick is smiling big waiting for his surprise] Uh, Patrick, you know how sometimes you plan something special and things don't just work out? Patrick: No...no...eh-gee! Holy mackerel! Is it hot up here or what?! [rips off his shirt and moves the ferries wheel seats back and forth and then up and down. Next, the Ferris wheel is jumping up and down and then SpongeBob puts out his hand/arm] SpongeBob: Patrick, here it is! [Patrick stares at SpongeBob's hand/arm] Patrick: What's that? SpongeBob: It's a handshake... a friendly handshake. Patrick: A handshake? That's the big gift? You got me a handshake? SpongeBob: A friendly handshake. Happy Valentine's Day! [Patrick pauses then shakes SpongeBob's hand, stares at it, and makes a grumpy looking face. SpongeBob laughs and the Ferris wheel descends. Montage: At the Buddy Bounce, SpongeBob is happily jumping while Patrick is still looking at his hand with the same grumpy look. At the roller coaster, SpongeBob is happily raising his hands while Patrick is still looking at his hand with the same grumpy look. At the fun house, SpongeBob is happily jumping as the air blows his head upwards separate from his pants while Patrick is simply grumpily walking as the air just blows his pants. Bubble transition to them sitting in the bench.] Patrick: [sighs and stops grumpily looking at his hand] I've been thinking. At first, a handshake doesn't seem like much, but really it's the thought that counts\u2026 [Incidental 8 walks up with a box shaped like a heart full of chocolates in her arms] Incidental 8: Hey, SpongeBob, I just wanted to thank you for this box of chocolates. SpongeBob: Uh, no problem, Fran. [Incidental 8 walks off] Patrick: And even though I was expecting more... [Dave walks up with roses] Incidental 42: Thanks for the roses, SpongeBob. Happy Valentine's Day. SpongeBob: You too, Dave. [Incidental 42 walks off] Patrick: And not that it matters that we've been friends for so long... [Incidental 49 walks by with a bike] Incidental 49: Hey, SpongeBob, thanks for the bike! [talking to Patrick] Can you believe this guy? I just met him this morning! [Incidental 49 walks away, and Patrick begins to fume] Patrick: So as I was saying... Incidental 27: Uh, excuse me, do you guys have the time? Patrick: [turns red in anger, snaps and yells with rage, which is followed by him picking up and throwing Incidental 27 across the screen, shocking SpongeBob] Patrick needs love, too! [Patrick goes psycho freaky. A crashing sound is heard. He furiously bangs his stomach like a gorilla, grunts angrily as he runs closer towards the screen, angrily approaches a balloon cart, then furiously cuts the balloon strings from a salesman and furiously smashes the balloon cart with his buttocks. Cut to scene where children play with a guy in a heart suit; the children run off as Patrick approaches] I defy you, heart man! [angrily rips the suit in half and continues his rampage] P.A. System: Attention, everyone, there's a chubby pink starfish on the loose! [everyone runs screaming; Patrick sees a twirl-around ride that has hearts on it and goes mad over it] Patrick: \"Heart on stick must die! [goes to the pole and tries to pick it up; gives up eventually in tiredness; Patrick sees Incidental 141 eating a heart-shaped lollipop and turns red in anger] Heart on stick must die! [grabs it, breaks it, and stuffs it in his mouth. Incidental 141 screams as Patrick takes the lollipop.] SpongeBob: [gasps; gets mad] Patrick! Patrick: [turns around with an evil look on his face; angrily grumbles gibberish in a barbaric manner, making everyone scared and run to a dead-end at the Goo Lagoon dock; Patrick roars with rage] [Everyone gets scared.] Patrick: Give me SpongeBob! [SpongeBob is thrown in front of the group of citizens] SpongeBob: [laughs nervously] Patrick: You broke my heart! Now I'm gonna break something of yours! SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, I know I deserve this. [notes the crowd] But, do they? Patrick: They didn't get me anything either! [They throw a pile of gifts at Patrick's feet] Nope, it's too late for that now... for all of you! [He menacingly walks towards the crowd. The citizens take a step back and SpongeBob is scared; Patrick's shadow looms over SpongeBob's horrified face as he prepares to face the inevitable as Patrick roars and growls maniacally. Suddenly, Sandy arrives just in time behind Patrick with the repaired balloon and whipping at the scallops] Sandy: Yee-haw! Get along, little shellfish! Gallop, you scallops! [whipping the scallops as she lands in the carnival with the balloon right behind Patrick and letting the scallops go] SpongeBob: [smiles, relieved] Yeah! Sandy's here! Woo-hoo! Look, Patrick, it's here! It's here! The best Valentine in the whole wide world is right behind you! [jumping up and down pointing behind Patrick] Patrick: [ignores SpongeBob] Sure it is. SpongeBob: [jumping] I'm telling you, it's right there! Turn around! Patrick: Uh-uh. SpongeBob: [desperately] Patrick, just turn around! [Patrick still wouldn't listen. Everyone is yelling at Patrick to turn around, but he doesn't] Crowd: Turn around! You nincompoop! Why you! Patrick: You must think I'm pretty dumb, huh?! Crowd: Yes! Turn around! Patrick: No! Crowd: [chanting] Turn around! Turn around! Patrick: Nuh-uh! I'm gonna say this once and I'm not going to say it again, so pay attention! I am not, I repeat, not going to turn around for any reason... ever! Sandy: Howdy, Patrick! Patrick: [turns around] Hi, Sandy! [notices the chocolate balloon, then is confused and speaks gibberish] SpongeBob: Happy Valentine's Day, Patrick! [Patrick jumps for joy and jumps on the balloon] Patrick: Yay! My valentine! Hey, is this solid chocolate? SpongeBob: Patrick, no! [Patrick bites the balloon and chocolate explodes everywhere. SpongeBob and Patrick are in the mess] Patrick: Aw, SpongeBob... You didn't have to get me anything. [Fade to black as the episode ends.]",

  "synopsis": "After watching an episode of The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, SpongeBob and Patrick see a commercial for the new book saying that Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy will be signing the book starting at 8 o'clock. SpongeBob is unhappy due to the fact that he has to go to boating school. Patrick suggests calling in sick, but SpongeBob does not want his perfect attendance record to end. They then decide that SpongeBob will wait until he has to go to the bathroom, and then sneak to the comic book store when Mrs. Puff gives him the bathroom key.The next day in boating school, SpongeBob has to go to the bathroom. Mrs. Puff gives him the bathroom key and tells him to return it to her desk, and with that, SpongeBob exits the school. He and Patrick get to the store and get their books signed and walk through Jellyfish Fields. The jellyfish start to lift up Patrick and let him sit on them, with Patrick stating they are \"friendly.\" They then throw themselves into SpongeBob's net, then leave. SpongeBob and Patrick continue ending up buying ice cream. Incidental 49 congratulates SpongeBob on being her 100th customer and tells him he can come back for free ice cream anytime.The two pursuit into Goo Lagoon where they get into a Badminton match with Sandy and a friend named Dale. SpongeBob and Patrick end Sandy's unbeatable streak and are convinced by their fans to play another round. The cops come and arrest Dale, who is an ex-con on probation, for eating gummy fish. A fish tells SpongeBob that he and Dale were classmates back at Boating School and he was a nice guy until he started cutting class and ever since then, he became a criminal. With this, SpongeBob, who fears that he will meet the same fate as Dale if he kept ditching class, started to head back to school.SpongeBob has to race through the Bikini Bottom hug fest where a woman grabs him. He forces her to let go and continues. He ends up in a pit of tar and starts to drown, remembering the last words that Mrs. Puff said to him. Realizing he never returned the bathroom key, SpongeBob then fights his way out with a crowd cheering him on. He makes it back to the school with Mrs. Puff at the door and she becomes infuriated. He explains what he did, with her not knowing what he is talking about and does not have time for it since she has her own problems. The police are arresting her for ditching jury duty. The car pulls off with her telling SpongeBob to never ditch. SpongeBob adheres and says he will never ditch again, leaving her furious and confused with him wondering what \"again\" meant.",

Our molecular bubble is impenetrable! Man Ray: That's exactly what I was hoping for. [Laughs evilly] Mermaid Man: Whoa! [Man Ray knocks the two heroes over with the bubble] Man Ray: [Laughs evilly] Mermaid Man: Stop!

Patrick and SpongeBob: [hug each other and gasp] Narrator: For the first time, we learn about these legendary superheroes' origins, and their rise to stardom. Tomorrow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy will appear in the flesh signing their new books! [Patrick and SpongeBob bite their nails, and speak gibberish] Narrator: Don't delay! Arrive early to make sure you get your copy signed! Doors open at 8 a.m. Patrick: Oh, boy! We're gonna get our books signed and then we're gonna meet Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and then we're gonna shake their hands and then they're gonna sign our books! SpongeBob: There's only one problem! ...I can't. Patrick: What do you mean? [Drops SpongeBob] SpongeBob: I'll be in boating school at 8 a.m. tomorrow. Patrick: Oh, well, can't you just skip a day? Just call in sick. Always worked for Squidward. SpongeBob: And tarnish my reputation of never missing one day of school? I couldn't. Besides, that would be lying. And lying is wrong. Patrick: Okay. Hmm... oh, I know! What are those things you use when... after you eat, you need to take a... SpongeBob: Oh! Take a... take a bathroom break! Patrick: That's the one! Why don't you take a bathroom break tomorrow, sneak out the window, get your book signed, and sneak back into class! It wouldn't take long at all! SpongeBob: But what if I don't need to use the bathroom? Patrick: Oh! There's always the catch. [Speaks gibberish, and walks into the kitchen] I need brain fuel! Ah! SpongeBob, how am I gonna feed my brain when all you have is your fancy bubbly water? Well, it'll have to do. [Takes a bottle, and chugs it down, takes two other bottles] SpongeBob: Patrick, is this really neces\u2014 Patrick: \u2014sary?! Yes, it is! [Drinks the two bottles he took, camera cuts to Patrick's insides, and shows the water filling up his body as he drinks] SpongeBob: Patrick? Patrick: Yeah? SpongeBob: You feeling all right? Patrick: [Turns to see he is completely fattened] Uh-huh. [Burps] Why? SpongeBob: Nothing. Nothing. [Light bulb pops by his head] That's it! Patrick: What? [Burps] SpongeBob: I won't go to the bathroom \u2018til tomorrow. And when I have to go, I'll really have to... [changes position like he needs to go to the bathroom] ...go. [Laughs. Bubble transition to boating school] Mrs. Puff: Can anyone tell me what the hand signal is for a left turn? [Sees SpongeBob, who is groaning and holding his pee and even curling up his legs] Something the matter, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Nneee just a little... woo! Woo! I gotta, nnnnn, gotta go to the... Mrs. Puff: I'd say so. [Holds up the bathroom key] Here. [Close up to the bathroom key] SpongeBob: The bathroom key! Mrs. Puff: And make sure you return that bathroom key to my desk, or you're in big trouble, mister! SpongeBob: Nnnnn, thank you, Mrs. Puff. Nnnnn... [Squirms toward Mrs. Puff] Mrs. Puff: And hurry back! No dilly-dallying! SpongeBob: [Grabs the key] Thanks. Will do. Nnnnn... [Exits boating school. Bubble transition to Near Mint Comic Books] Barnacle Boy: [Finishing up signing a book for a young fish] There you are, young man. Fish: Oh, boy. Signed by Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Now I shall be the envy of the Superhero Fan Club! Ohhh... [walks away] Barnacle Boy: Next. Mermaid Man: Boy, I sure do like signing books. What's this for again? SpongeBob: Hi, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, will you sign our books? Barnacle Boy: Of course. [Takes books. Patrick and SpongeBob excitedly speak gibberish together] Barnacle Boy: There you go. Patrick and SpongeBob: Thank you! Barnacle Boy: Anytime, boys. Mermaid Man: And remember, stay on the path of evil! Barnacle Boy: It's stay away from the path of evil. Mermaid Man: Oh. Wh-what is evil? Barnacle Boy: Oh. [Speaks gibberish. Bubble transition to Jellyfish Fields] SpongeBob: Okay, that was fun. Well, I should really start heading back to class. Patrick: SpongeBob, look! [Cuts to a jellyfish] Let's go catch it! [Runs after the jellyfish] SpongeBob: But what about my class? Patrick: This is a shortcut. SpongeBob: Wait up! You don't even have a net! Patrick! [gasps, camera cuts to numerous jellyfish] Wow. Neptune's scepter, I don't believe this! Patrick: Pretty cool, huh? [Cuts to Patrick in midair] SpongeBob: How'd you do that? Patrick: I didn't do it. They did. [Camera pans out to show Patrick actually sitting on some jellyfish, pats one] They're friendly. SpongeBob: Wow! [Looks up, a jellyfish sees SpongeBob's net, smiles, and goes inside of it] Oh boy, you weren't kidding! [Laughs and runs along with Patrick. Camera cuts to SpongeBob catching one jellyfish, then two, then four] SpongeBob: [Shown having caught all the jellyfish] You're free to go, guys. [Jellyfish exit net. Bubble transition to the street] Patrick: [Stops SpongeBob] Ice cream! [Runs toward stand] SpongeBob: Oh, come on, I don't have time for this. Patrick: Yeah, four scoops. [Sadie scoops a final vanilla scoop onto Patrick's cone] SpongeBob: Patrick, have you forgotten I gotta go? Patrick: Oh don't be such a sourpuss. [Gets out a dollar and hands it to Sadie] Here, I'll buy you a cone. [Confetti falls] Sadie: [Uses a noise maker] Congratulations! You're my 100th customer! [Pulls down sheet saying '100TH CUSTOMER!'] From now on, you can come back and have all the free ice cream you want! SpongeBob: [Laughs. Bubble transition to Goo Lagoon] Patrick: [Picks up ice cream with his tooth, gulps it down, shivers, and lets out a breath of cold air] SpongeBob: [Slides ice cream into his mouth with his tongue, gulps it down, shivers, and lets out a breath of cold air] SpongeBob: [Eats cone along with Patrick] Well, this certainly has been a glorious day, but I better get back to class. Patrick: [Speaks muffledly] SpongeBob: Oh, you said it buddy. Sandy: Where do you think you're going, SquarePants? You just got here. SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Sandy, but I just gotta get back to class. Sandy: Sure you can't stay for just a short spell, SpongeBob? I mean, it's such a nice day, everyone's having a good time. Every Fish at Goo Lagoon: Hi, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: No! I gave Mrs. Puff my word, and I shall not betray her! Sandy: Not even for a game of badminton with me and Dale here? SpongeBob: Okay, maybe just one game. [Bubble transition to the badminton game] Sandy: I'm serving it up, SpongeBob! Ready or not! [Throws up birdie] SpongeBob: Patrick, you know how to play this game? Patrick: [shrugs] Sandy: [serves birdie] SpongeBob: Is this the one when the lowest score wins? [Sets racquet outward, birdie bounces off it, Sandy tries to save, but birdie lands right by her racquet] Sandy: Nice job SpongeBob, your serve! SpongeBob: Here it comes! [Throws up birdie, but cannot hit it with the racquet, falls, and ends up serving with his foot. Birdie flies past Sandy and Dale, and lands in the sand] SpongeBob: Hey, I'm getting pretty good at this game! Patrick: [Hits birdie] Sandy: [Spikes birdie down, and makes a hole in Patrick's head] SpongeBob: [squirms, the racquet hits the birdie and lands directly where Sandy and Dale's area started] Gus: He's about to beat the undefeated Sandy Cheeks at her own game! Crowd: SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [Continue chanting] SpongeBob: [serves birdie] Dale: [hits birdie back] SpongeBob: [Lightly hits birdie back] Sandy: [Hits birdie back] SpongeBob: [Screams, jumps in the air, and hits birdie. Sandy and Dale tried to hit it back, but almost barely succeed, the birdie landing in the sand] Crowd: Yay! SpongeBob: [Walking away] Well I better be off now. Crowd: No! Gus: Don't go SpongeBob, think about your fans! SpongeBob: Well if it's for the fans, well maybe I can play one game more. Orange police fish: [off-screen] Not today, yellow. Light teal police fish: You've been playing with a convicted felon, and we know he's violated his parole somehow. You might as well confess Dale. [A crowd begins to gather around the scene] Dale: Hey man, I haven't done nothing! Officer John: Oh yeah? What have you got in there? [Police pulls out candy from Dale's shirt pocket] Quasi-Gummy Chewy Candy Fish. Is this how you have fun? By eating your own kind? Scum like you make me sick. Cuff him! [Another police fish approaches Dale and clutches handcuffs around Dale's wrists, which are now behind his back. Dale is escorted away from the scene] Gus: That's a shame what happened to Dale. We were classmates back in boating school. He used to be a good student, until he started cutting class. Ever since then, he's led the lonely life of a criminal. SpongeBob: C-c-c-c... [pulls his bottom eyelids down] ...criminal!? [A woman's scream is heard off-screen in horror of this. Lets go of eyelids] I gotta go back to class! [Runs in circles, and runs away upside down] I can't be a ditcher! [Runs into volleyball game, is accidentally involved as the volleyball, ends up in the road and is run over by an old roller blader, he struggles to find his body, until only his legs are missing, he sees his legs running, pants to catch up with them and jumps into them] Almost there. Just have to get past the... [skids to a halt] ...Bikini Bottom Hug Fest? Sadie: Aww... does someone need a hug? SpongeBob: No, no, no, no... Sadie: [Hugs SpongeBob] Don't fight the love, kid. SpongeBob: Miss, if you don't let me go right now, I might have to turn into a criminal! [Squeezes out of Sadie's grip, and rolls away] Whaaa! Sadie: [gasps] That sounded like a threat! Harold: I am so sorry. [Hugs Sadie as she may begin weeping. Cut to SpongeBob, still rolling] SpongeBob: [speaks gibberish, and falls off a cliff] Whoa! [lands in blue gunk, camera pans out to show surroundings, as well as the sign to show where he is] The tar pits? [sinks] Ah! I'm sinking! [spits out tar] Well, I guess this is the end, SquarePants. But like the old saying goes, \"Better to end up sinking into a prehistoric lake of tar, then to turn to a life of crime!\" Goodbye, world. Goodbye, Mrs. Puff. I'll always cherish those last kind words that you said to me. [thinks] Mrs. Puff: Make sure you return that bathroom key to my desk or you're in big trouble mister! SpongeBob: [sinks all the way in. Camera stays at tar pits for a while, before SpongeBob's tar-covered hand pops up with the bathroom key, also covered in tar] SpongeBob: [walks up from the tar, losing the tar from where he pops up] Ohh I never returned Mrs. Puff's bathroom key! I can't give up now! Crowd: SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob: [pulls onto a prehistoric animal's tusk, and is flung face-first into the wall. Camera cuts to cliff, which SpongeBob climbs] SpongeBob: [Runs for boating school] I made it! And a minute before the final bell. I am home free. [Tries walking through the door, but ends up running into Mrs. Puff] Mrs. Puff... I'm really sorry! Please forgive me! I don't know what happened! Everything just got away from me! [Holds up bathroom key] I brought back your bathroom key, though! Mrs. Puff: I haven't the foggiest idea of what you're carrying on about SpongeBob, but I don't have time for it. I've got my own problems. [Two police officers show up behind her, and cuff her] Johnny Law finally caught up to me for ditching jury duty. Let this be a lesson to you, son...never ditch! SpongeBob: Okay Mrs. Puff, I'll never ditch again! Mrs. Puff: That's a good boy, SpongeBob. Good... Again?! What do you mean, again?!? [Bus drives away]",

  "synopsis": "The episode begins in the Krusty Krab, with Bubble Bass ordering food to add to his account. Then Mr. Krabs tells Bubble Bass that he will not get any more food until he pays his tab. Bubble Bass tosses a coin, which Mr. Krabs takes. Bubble Bass tries to negotiate another way and invites Mr. Krabs to a friendly game of three deadly challenges of a tabulation game (of castles). SpongeBob is thrilled with the idea, but Mr. Krabs rejects the board game, causing Bubble Bass to run away. Squidward says Bubble Bass is gone because in his own words, they would never see that game geek again. A voice is heard through the drive-thru speaker saying he wants 50 Krabby Patties with extra pickles. This voice is from Bubble Bass, and SpongeBob is about to give him the Krabby Patties, but Mr. Krabs finds out. Bubble Bass provokes Mr. Krabs by dancing at the drive-thru window until a car honks at him. Mr. Krabs sends Squidward and SpongeBob to Bubble Bass's house to collect his tab.Squidward opens a door to Bubble Bass's house, which SpongeBob is surprised by and praises by saying that he is very strong. SpongeBob and Squidward decide to look for Bubble Bass, but they cannot find him, so they decide to sell the furniture in the house. Bubble Bass tells them to stop destroying his mother's furniture, and they can work it out in the basement. Bubble Bass tells them that if they want him to pay, they need to play the 3 deadly challenges. SpongeBob looks for the game and, upon finding it, tells Bubble Bass that they will play his game. The two enter through the hatch and realize that there is a real version of the 3 Deadly Challenges (made of boxes). The first challenge begins: they both attack Bubble Bass and try to tap him out. Squidward tries to land a blow and hits Bubble Bass, but his belly blocks the attack. The boxes collapse and SpongeBob and Squidward fall, decapitating Bubble Bass, revealing that the Bubble Bass that Squidward tried to attack was not the real Bubble Bass, but a doll (made with Bubble Bass' mom's sofa cushions and sleeping bag). Bubble Bass starts insulting them after SpongeBob does the same, then the second challenge begins: fighting a bull. They both go to the Duel Arena, find a box and a red scarf, and the box starts making bull noises. Bubble Bass' mother comes out of the box and rages like a bull (because Bubble Bass told his mother that the furniture in the house was chipped by SpongeBob and Squidward), so the two try to hide behind the cloth, but Bubble Bass' mother still attacks them. In the middle of the fight, Mama Bass and Squidward begin to dance the tango, while SpongeBob is fond of it, but suddenly Mama Bass's watch beeps and she tells Squidward that she has to go to a bake sale and to call her. Bubble Bass, when he sees that his mother left, yells \"Why?!\" as the cardboard stage collapses.Then follows the third and final challenge: the joust. Bubble Bass prepares to fight Squidward. When SpongeBob is about to give Squidward his shield, Squidward tells him that he does not need it, while SpongeBob says \"My hero!.\" Bubble Bass and Squidward charge to attack each other. Squidward uses his spear and uses so much force that he thrusts it into Bubble Bass's belly button, defeating him. Squidward and SpongeBob approach Bubble Bass and tell him that now he must pay his bill, but Bubble Bass tells them that he spent all his money on the cardboard boxes, so Squidward tells him that Sir Krabs (Mr. Krabs) will know how to fix this.In the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs puts Bubble Bass to work to pay his bill, but Bubble Bass keeps complaining about work, annoying customers in different ways. The clients, angered by Bubble Bass, go directly to Mr. Krabs' office to pay him everything that Bubble Bass owes so that he can leave immediately. Mr. Krabs, already with the Bubble Bass account paid, goes to Bubble Bass, who was washing the dishes in the toilet, and tells him that his bill is already paid and that he can leave, Bubble Bass comes out of the bathroom happily. To Mr. Krabs' surprise and dismay, Bubble Bass does not leave, but instead orders a bunch more food and tells Mr. Krabs that he just opened a new account and goes on top of his cardboard horse, so Mr. Krabs furiously chases after Bubble Bass. Suddenly, SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen with a rose in his mouth and dances the tango with Squidward, but suddenly Mama Bass asks him if she can dance too, to which Squidward says yes. The episode ends with Mama Bass and Squidward dancing the tango and leaving the Krusty Krab.",

  "transcript": "[The episode starts at the Krusty Krab.] Squidward: One large Flatsom fries. Extra jetsam. [drops it on the tray] Four orders of duckweed. [drops it on the tray] Bubble Bass: Hmm. Methinks thou forgot my gravy, thou lumpish clay-brained flap dragon. SpongeBob: [laughs] Flap dragon. [giggles] Squidward: [sighs] Oh, and finally, one Deep Sea Donut. [drops it on the tray] That comes to a total of- Bubble Bass: Whatever the measure, squire, put it on my account. Mr. Krabs: [peeks in from tray] Oh, no, you don't. No more food for you until you pay your tab. [rolls out a long check] Bubble Bass: P-p-p-ay t-t-t-t-tab? [reaches into his pocket and grabs a coin] I'll flip you for it. [flips the coin] Mr. Krabs: [grabs the coin] I'll take that. Bubble Bass: [pulls a game from his pants] How about a friendly game of Three Deadly Challenges? SpongeBob: Oh, castle! Pick castle! Mr. Krabs: Oh... [slaps the game out of Bubble Bass' hands] Bubble Bass: [runs out of building] Squidward: [laughs] I bet we'll never see that game geek again. Bubble Bass: [through the drive thru speaker] 50 Krabby Patties, please. Extra pickles. [at the drive thru window] Put it on my tab. SpongeBob: [walks up to the drive thru window to deliver food to Bubble Bass] Coming right up! Mr. Krabs: [yelling] Bubble Bass! You... Bubble Bass: [singing/taunting] Hey, nonny nonny! You look pretty funny! You won't get my money! [starts rubbing his butt on drive thru window] Nah nah nah nah nah! [A dad in his car covers his kid's eyes and honks his horn, causing Bubble Bass to run away.] Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward! I want you and SpongeBob to go after Bubble Bass, and collect his tab! [gives the tab to Squidward] SpongeBob: [squeals] Squidward: Blech. [Bubble transition to Bubble Bass' house, where SpongeBob and Squidward are about to arrive at.] SpongeBob: [singing] Hey, nonny nonny! You look pretty funny! You won't get my money! [stops singing] I can't help it. It's catchy. Squidward: Look, I just want to collect the money as soon as possible and go. Bubble Bass, we're here to collect your tab! [kicks down the door] SpongeBob: Squidward, that was so masculine. Squidward: Heh. Well, I... Let's go. [he and SpongeBob walk into Bubble Bass' house] I know you're in here. Come out! SpongeBob: [sniffs] Hmm. Smells funny in here. [Bubble Bass appears as a moose head on the wall before popping back into the wall.] Squidward: Smells like deadbeat. Hmm. [shouting] If you don't pay up, we'll... sell this furniture. [holds up a nearby chair and drops it, damaging the corner; SpongeBob gasps] Whoops. How much do you think this is worth? I just chipped it. SpongeBob: Oh, it was the chip that sold me! [holds out a dollar bill] I'll give you ten bucks. Bubble Bass: [from basement] Hey! Don't touch mother's things! I'll pay the tab! Come downstairs, and we'll work it out. [he pulls the carpet, causing SpongeBob and Squidward to painfully fall down the stairs into the basement] SpongeBob: [lands in Squidward's lap] My savior. Squidward: [rolls SpongeBob off his lap] Alright, where is he? Bubble Bass: [from underground room; hatch opens] If you want me to pay, you'll have to play the Three Deadly Challenges! SpongeBob: [jumps into the air] Oh! The Three Deadly Challenges! I got this game! [opens up his body, revealing a shelf of board games] Where is it? Game of Strife, Chutes and Bladders... Oh, here it is! [pulls out Three Deadly Challenges and closes his body] Ah! The Three Deadly Challenges! Squidward: A board game. Whoopee. SpongeBob: [shouting] Okay, Bubble Bass! We accept the challenge! Squidward: Why are you giving him the upper hand? He owes us money! SpongeBob: Oh. But I wanna pway the Thwee Deadwy Chawenges. Squidward: Oh, all wight al- [clears throat] -alright already! Let's get this over with! SpongeBob: Oh yeah! [Squidward kicks him into underground cellar as SpongeBob laughs] Squidward: Oh, boy. [climbs ladder into cellar] [in the cellar] SpongeBob: Wow. A life-size version of the Three Deadly Challenges. Beautiful. Squidward: Looks like a hobo campground. SpongeBob: No, Squidward. You have to look with your imagination. [waves his hand across the screen, revealing a more fantasy-like landscape] Squidward: What the? No! [ruins the fantasy landscape with his tentacles] It's a dump! Bubble Bass: Thou art two oozing cysts on the hind side of a plague dog's nose. Squidward: What did he say? SpongeBob: The colorful insults are the best part of the game. Squidward: That figures. Hmm. [walks to where Bubble Bass is along with SpongeBob] So how do you win this goofball game, anyway? SpongeBob: Since Bubble Bass challenged us, all we have to do is get close enough to tag him out. We get three chances, or should I say three challenges. Squidward: Oh. [grunts] SpongeBob: Oh, boy! [he and Squidward grab a sword] Look, Squidward! [slashes with a cardboard sword a few times] Squidward: Oh, this feels stupid. [sighs] SpongeBob and Squidward: Charge! [SpongeBob and Squidward charge up the cardboard mountain. Squidward yells as he hit Bubble Bass' belly with the sword.] Squidward: Hmm? [the mountain starts shaking] Uh oh. [SpongeBob grabs onto Squidward as the structure falls down. They both scream as they crash to the ground. A crowd cheering sound effect plays from a speaker.] Squidward: [tags what he assumes to be Bubble Bass] Tag, you lose! [laughs along with SpongeBob, but accidentally rips apart the decoy. SpongeBob screams] SpongeBob: We decapitated him! Squidward: Oh, calm down. It's just a dummy he made from his mother's couch cushions and a sleeping bag. [sighs] All of this for a tab? SpongeBob: Oh! But you were magnificent, Squidward. So strong and courageous. Squidward: [pushing SpongeBob back] As always. Bubble Bass: Thy canker sore bottoms curdle seaweed and sour the ocean. Squidward: Oh, you- SpongeBob: [getting up] I got this one, Squidward. Oh, yeah? Well, your pillows are filled with urchins, [pulling on Squidward's shirt and letting go] and your shirts are inside out! Squidward: [rubbing his nose] Adding injury to insult. [Trumpet fanfare plays as SpongeBob and Squidward enter a cardboard arena.] Squidward: Oh... [the speaker plays a cheering sound effect again] Oh, look at all this junk. SpongeBob: [excitedly] I know. Isn't it great? Squidward: [pulls on his nose] Let's finish this. [grabs a red cloth] He's obviously in that bullpen. [The box makes huffing and growling noises. Mama Bass hops out like a bull, and roars at SpongeBob and Squidward, launching spit at their faces.] SpongeBob and Squidward: Bubble Bass' mom! Mama Bass: You! You chipped my furniture! [she growls as she gets ready to charge at them] Squidward: He tricked us. What do we do? SpongeBob: Hide! [he pulls the cloth over him and Squidward, both whimpering] Mama Bass: [close-up of her eyes turning into tablecloths] And that's my good tablecloth! [tire squealing is heard as she charges towards SpongeBob and Squidward, attacking them in a fighting cloud] [Mama Bass repeatedly jumps on top of the two of them, then starts crushing them with her individual buttocks. They get into another fighting cloud, and Mama Bass slams SpongeBob and Squidward together. The fighting cloud reappears, and she bites on Squidward's legs, making him scream. The fighting cloud reappears again, and this time she does a tango dance with Squidward. Mama Bass shoves a rose into Squidward's mouth.] SpongeBob: Aww! [Eventually, an alarm on Mama Bass' watch goes off.] Mama Bass: Huh? [lets go of Squidward] Sorry, sweetie. Gotta run. [walks off] I'm late for the bake sale. Call me! [Squidward pulls the collar of his shirt, sweating, and gulps.] Bubble Bass: [in the crowd] Mother! Why?! [Bubble Bass' screaming causes the cardboard crowd to fall down. Medieval fanfare plays from the speaker. Squidwars is reeled downward by SpongeBob by a crank. SpongeBob gets tired, and accidentally lets go of the crank causing Squidward to fall down onto a cardboard seahorse. SpongeBob slides over to give him a lance.] SpongeBob: Sir Squidward, you look magnificent upon your mighty steed. [he waves his hand across the screen again, recreating the fantasy landscape] Squidward: [gasps] Yes. Yes, I see it now! Bubble Bass: [lands on the ground] Any last words, Squid-wuss? Squidward: May thy fat head be set upon by sea spiders and torn asunder, leaving only thine eyes to witness the humiliation! Bubble Bass: Ooh, pretty good last words. SpongeBob: [handing Squidward a shield] Sir Squidward, thy shield. Squidward: Ha! Shield, shmield. [knocks the shield away with his lance] SpongeBob: My hero. [The speaker plays the cheering sound again, and Squidward and Bubble Bass look at each other, grunting as each of them get a cinematic close-up. SpongeBob blows into the giant horn and falls off the boxes. Squidward and Bubble Bass charge at each other, and SpongeBob covers his face with his costume.] SpongeBob: Oh, I can't look! [his eyes rip out of the costume] [Squidward and Bubble Bass continue charging at each other.] Bubble Bass: Mommy! [Squidward's lance deeply penetrates Bubble Bass' belly, sending him back and causing him to fall to the floor.] Squidward: [punches Bubble Bass' face with his lance] Alright, Bubble Bass. You're tagged. Pay your tab. [SpongeBob mocks Bubble Bass with the tab.] Bubble Bass: You bested me at Three Deadly Challenges. But I am broke! Verily, I spent all of my money on cardboard. [a piece of cardboard falls down] What are you going to do to me? Squidward: Nothing, but I am sure Mr. Krabs has some Deadly Challenges of his own for you. [The scene bubble transitions to the Krusty Krab, where Bubble Bass is mopping the floor.] Bubble Bass: This is torture! My arms are killing me. I can't feel my fingers. [letting go of the mop and clenching his right arm] I feel a cramp! I'm cramped! [leaps up, and his butt touches a customer's Krabby Patty] My back is breaking. [the patty's ketchup squirts into a child's face, making him cry, and the customer takes him away angrily. Bubble Bass faceplants into the mop bucket] Oh... [Several customers are complaining to Mr. Krabs.] Customers: That guy is terrible! [more overlapping dialogue] Mr. Krabs: Look, I sympathize. He's gotta work here until he pays off his tab. Fred: I've got some money. [lays money on Mr. Krabs' desk] Woman: I'll contribute to that. [The child from earlier grabs a hammer and breaks his piggy bank on the desk.] Mr. Krabs: What? That's not- I didn't really- oh- oh. [gasps as he sees several customers giving him money to pay off the tab] Old man: Just get that menace out of here! [Mr. Krabs walks over to the restroom with the money, humming. Bubble Bass is cleaning the restroom toilet, mumbling to himself as he flushes the toilet.] Bubble Bass: Hmm? Mr. Krabs: Alright, Bubble Bass. Your tab's been wiped clean. [rips apart the tab] You can go. [Bubble Bass stares at him] Well? Go already! Bubble Bass: [running past Mr. Krabs, making him spin] Verily, I am free-ith! [giggles] Mr. Krabs: [gets dizzy, and gets up. He giggles as he counts the money. He then hears the cash register ding] Huh? [walks out] [Mr. Krabs' jaw literally drops as he sees Squidward giving Bubble Bass four bags of Krusty Krab food.] Bubble Bass: [imitates a horse] Krabs! I thank thee, clapper-clawed barnacle, for forgiving my debt. And FYI, I just opened up a [close-up of his face] new tab. [squeals and laughs as he walks away] Hi-ya! Mr. Krabs: Oh, Bubble Bass! [runs toward Bubble Bass, who is laughing while running away] [Squidward laughs. SpongeBob exits the kitchen with a rose in his mouth.] SpongeBob: [takes the rose out of his mouth] Ole, Se\u00f1or Squidward? [Squidward jumps out the boat, and holds his arm out to SpongeBob.] Squidward: Ole, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob puts the rose back into his mouth, twirls, and then starts dancing with Squidward.] Squidward: I'll lead. Mama Bass: [pokes Squidward's arm] May I? [Mama Bass giggles whilst looking at Squidward.] Squidward: Eh, but of course. [he and Mama Bass dance. SpongeBob eats the rose, and the episode ends with Squidward and Mama Bass dancing out of the Krusty Krab]",

  "synopsis": "Squidward arrives at the Krusty Krab as happy as ever because of his upcoming clarinet recital. He  repeatedly gets pummeled, such as Incidental 64's morning breath punching him in the face, or getting the door slammed on him, but since his clarinet is safe in a suitcase, he is happy. But when Incidental 46 comes to the Krusty Krab, and her baby drools on the clarinet, Squidward becomes furious. He demands Mr. Krabs to give him a place to store his stuff, Mr. Krabs gives him his Navy locker, and SpongeBob single-handedly cleans it.He stores his toothbrush in the locker, while Squidward puts his clarinet in it, not risking it getting soiled before his presentation. While Squidward is going through his daily routines, he discovers SpongeBob is always doing something to the locker. In fear for his clarinet, he goes to see what happens, and leaves change on the floor when he was giving it to a customer. Just then, Mr. Krabs jumps out wildly and acts like a gorilla, scaring everyone away from the loose change.When Squidward crawls inside the locker, it is revealed that SpongeBob had converted it into a whole room, and the second time he visits it, he finds his clarinet gone, as SpongeBob relocated it elsewhere, and goes looking for it. He discovers a small door near the floor and crawls through it, only to enter a mysterious forest made of clarinets. He spots his clarinet just before he is picked up by a large eagle head, \"The Keeper\" of the Horned Forest, or Clarinetland, who tells him to learn respect, to grant peace to clarinets, and that a clarinet cannot be owned. Feeling intimidated, he claims he has learned respect and tries to escape, but \"The Keeper\u201d refuses to believe him and swallows him.Squidward then finds himself chasing SpongeBob for his clarinet into a giant pinball machine, where a gigantic Patrick finds Squidward as a prize. Patrick later says it is a giant vacuum cleaner called \"The Pressure\" that is doing all of this. Suddenly, the vacuum sucks up Squidward and explodes. Squidward is now finding himself chasing SpongeBob literally through space, finally grabs him, and returns to inside the locker. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob return to the kitchen, and Squidward realizes that it was just a dream. SpongeBob reveals to Squidward that he had the clarinet the whole time after seeing Squidward upset. Before Squidward goes to the presentation, he locks SpongeBob into the locker as payback for stealing his clarinet. However, at the presentation, he finds SpongeBob in his case, and runs from the stage right before the presentation, revealing that SpongeBob was just giving him the clarinet.",

  "transcript": "[A beautiful day in Bikini Bottom. A car leaves and pieces of asphalt fly into Squidward's face.] Squidward: [sighs] What a day! [Squidward singing and enters the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob accidentally hits Squidward with the door] SpongeBob: Good morning, Krusty Krab! [notices Squidward] Oh... Sorry, Squidward! Didn't see ya there! Squidward: [still smiling] Not a problem, SpongeBob, not a problem at all! Mr. Krabs: Specials? We don't have specials! [scratches the slateboard while people can't stand the screeching sound except Squidward] Squidward: Good morning, sir! Welcome to the Krusty Krab. Thaddeus: Uh... I'll think I'll have a Krabby Patty. [His bad breath punches Squidward, plugs his nose, and he is still happy.] Squidward: One Krabby Patty coming up! Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, you're in a chipper mood this morning, did you get an order of fancy decorative soaps in the mail or somethin'? Squidward: Even better, I have a clarinet recital immediately after work today! So ain't nothing gonna ruin my day. [Nazz's baby accidentally squirts her milk from his bottle onto Squidward's clarinet box.] Nazz: Oh, terribly sorry, sir. Squidward: No need! See? Not a drop! [Nazz's baby drools onto Squidward's clarinet.] Squidward: [finally snaps in extreme fury] Grrrrr... [shouts loudly] I can't take this anymore! Mr. Krabs: I told you, there's no early-bird special, now stop calling me here-- Mother! Squidward: This is unacceptable! Mr. Krabs: What? Squidward: This! [points to his clarinet] Mr. Krabs: Nice to have ya back, Squidward. Squidward: This is an outrage! I no longer tolerate my personal items being soiled by the ravels that crawls in this restaurant! I demand a place to put my stuff! Mr. Krabs: Hmm... okay, uhhh. I suppose you could put it with the nacho cheese, no one's got near that in years. Squidward: You ever read this? [hands out a book] Mr. Krabs: Bikini Bottom Labor Regulations? Eww! Gross! [grows hives] Get that thing away from me! It's giving me hives! Squidward: It specifically states that all employers must provide his or her employees with a secure, clean place to store personal property. Mr. Krabs: Gahh! Blast you, Squidward! You drive a hard bargain. I guess I could rustle something up for ya. [patties sizzling] SpongeBob: Yeah... sizzle those juices. [Mr. Krabs brings a rusty locker] Mr. Krabs: Oh! Here we go! Found it! SpongeBob: Wow, what is it? [Spiders eat away SpongeBob's arm] Mr. Krabs: It's me old navy locker. Good as new! [opens and shows bones of Corporal Sterling] SpongeBob: Who is that, Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs: [as he empties the locker] Uhh... Appears to be Corporal Sterling, lad. Heh...forgot all about that prank. [empties the locker] Squidward! Your locker is ready! SpongeBob: Ooh! Do we share our lockers like we share hairnets? Squidward: Not at a whale's age. Mr. Krabs: Now not so fast, Mr. Squidward, the law requires that all employees have a secure place for personal items. So you are required by law, to share. Squidward: Ohh, I suppose I can share but only since it requires by law. Hey! This thing is filthy! You don't expect me to clean it?! SpongeBob: [with a bucket of water and duster] No! He doesn't! And I don't either! [dusts the locker, Squidward and Mr. Krabs cough due to dust, opens the door, absorbs the water and blasts it onto the locker, the locker looks good as new.] Mr. Krabs: Blimey! She hasn't sparkled like this since boot camp! Carry on, boys. Squidward: Impressive indeed. Just keep your grubby little hands to your side. SpongeBob: You got it, Squidward. Finally, I have a clean place to store my toothbrush. Squidward: Just don't touch my clarinet! SpongeBob: I promise nothing untoward will happen. [shuts the locker and rings the bell] Squidward: Order up, SpongeBob! [walks towards SpongeBob] Squidward: SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing? You're supposed to be fry cooking. I told you not to touch my stuff! SpongeBob: I didn't! I wore protective gloves! And besides, don't you like how classy it look now? Squidward: Velvet.. SpongeBob: Now I'd like to stand by and idly chat with you, Squidward, But I must attend to my Krusty Krab duties! In the future, please keep your interruptions to a minimum, sir, please! [SpongeBob comes in with a load of appliances] Squidward: And here's your change, ma'am. Squidward: What is that idiot doing now?! [throws his change on the ground] Customer: Loose change! [the people start to collect as Mr. Krabs bursts out and yells like a gorilla to scare them away] Squidward: I hope you're not trying to shove the boxes into that locker! SpongeBob: Too late! It's already done. Squidward: If you smashed my clarinet-- so help me, Neptune-- I will- [opens the locker] SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward, there's plenty of room! SpongeBob: I... expanded a bit. Squidward: Well, it's all fine and dandy, but where's my clarinet? SpongeBob: Well, that's simple. SpongeBob: We just simply consult the card catalog and find... Squidward's Clarinet drawer 36.8-B. [opens the cabinet and reveals Squidward's clarinet] SpongeBob: See? Squidward: Fine. But remember, It's vitally important that nothing happens to it. SpongeBob: Don't worry, buddy! [slams the drawer shut] SpongeBob: You're in good hands. [Squidward places order onto Scooter's table when appliance noises come from the locker. Squidward checks the locker.] Squidward: What's he doing?! Customer 2: May I order, please? Squidward: Alright what do you want? [appliance noise] Customer 2: I'll have- [jackhammer running] Customer 2: Is everything okay back there? Squidward: Yeah, Just a bit of a... renovation. [saw noises gets louder, locker flips] Squidward: [freaking out] My clarinet! SpongeBob! [opens the locker door and reveals a grand locker room] Squidward: SpongeBob? Squidward: There. 36.8-B. Squidward: [gasps] A note?! SpongeBob: Item has temporarily moved during reconstruction. Relocated to shelf 1,018.2-E. Squidward: SpongeBob?! Squidward: 1,018.2-E. Squidward: Another note?! SpongeBob: Oops! Did I say 1,018.2-E? I meant 2,019.3-M! Sorry! [Squidward grasps the note in anger] Squidward: SpongeBob?! SpongeBob?! [SpongeBob laughing and running] Squidward: SpongeBob, Wait! Squidward: What have you done to my...? [ends up in the corner, discovers a small hole and crawls in] Squidward: SpongeBob, I do not play games! [Opens the curtain. Finding himself in a forest of clarinets.] Squidward: [gasps] Where am I? What is this place? [A clarinet jumping in front of him] Squidward: My clarinet! [The clarinet escapes in SpongeBob's hands] Squidward: What the\u2026? [SpongeBob starts to laugh] Hey, come back, I need my clarinet, come back! Where are you? SpongeBo- [bumps into an eagle head] Eagle: I am the keeper of the horned forest. State your business here. Squidward: Uhh... I'm... trying to find my clarinet. Eagle: Your clarinet? Squidward: Yes, my clarinet! Which I am the proud owner. Eagle: [laughs] A clarinet is not owned. Why don't you tell me why you're really here? Squidward: You calling me a liar?! [the eagle grabs Squidward with his tongue and Squidward yells] Eagle: I don't appreciate your tone. Squidward: I-I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to offend you. Eagle: This is a sacred place where clarinets live without persecution. [the eagle squeezes Squidward tightly] You need to learn respect. Squidward: I've learned... [loosely] I've learned respect. Eagle: I don't believe you. [the eagle then swallows Squidward. Squidward screams and ends up in the stomach. He coughs and sees SpongeBob laughing.] Squidward: Stand still, you idiot! [SpongeBob continues laughing] Squidward: I got you now! [grabs SpongeBob and falls in a strange room, without Spongebob] Squidward: Haa, haa! What the...? SpongeBob? SpongeBob?! [SpongeBob laughs as he hangs down from a hole. As he disappears again, the hole vanishes. In a mirror, Squidward laughs wickedly, gets his clarinet, sniffs, laughs wickedly again, and shoves it in his mouth. Two Squidward's in two mirrors with clarinets in their mouths began to play and plays a high pitched note at Squidward's ears, causing Squidward to scream. Squidward runs on a clarinet while five clarinets were playing above. Then he chases SpongeBob and falls into a clarinet hole and is sent into a pinball machine.] Patrick: I win! I win! [the \"prize\" is Squidward and he grabs him] Patrick: Hey, what are you doing here? Squidward: You tell me what in the wide world of sports is this place? And how did you get so big? Patrick: Must be all the pressure. Squidward: What are you talking about? Patrick: It must be... the pressure. [the ground starts shaking] Patrick: I gotta get outta here! [runs off] Squidward: Where are you going, you imbecile?! [SpongeBob continues on laughing as he runs past Squidward. Just then, Squidward gets sucked in the vacuum and it explodes into space where SpongeBob keeps on laughing as Squidward chases him.] Squidward: Almost... gotcha! [shouts as he crashes] [The locker opens and Squidward melts] Mr. Krabs: [laughing] I just sweet talked an old lady out of $20 for a Krabby Patty! [laughs again] [Squidward groans] SpongeBob: Squidward, are you okay? Squidward: [muttering] Such a nightmare! SpongeBob: Squidward, what are you trying to say, buddy? Squidward: [coughs] I tried to get my clarinet in there... [sobs] Impossible! SpongeBob: Clari- Oh! You mean this! [hands out his clarinet] Squidward: Where did you get that?! SpongeBob: Well, with all the ruckus you were making over it, I kept it with me, just to make sure it was safe. [Squidward growls in fury] SpongeBob: Call it a friendly gesture! Squidward: I'll show you a friendly gesture! Do you know the horror I've endured?! [throws SpongeBob into the locker] Let's see how you like it! [locks it, tugs it out, and throws it into a bus going to Far Far Away] [the bus leaves and he sighs with relief] Judge: Are you ready, Mr. Squidward? Squidward: Yes, yes I am; as a matter of fact, you wouldn't believe what I had to go through to get\u2026 [screams when SpongeBob pops out of Squidward's clarinet case] SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! You wouldn't believe what I had to go through to get here. Squidward: [screams again and runs out] SpongeBob: Huh. I was just going to bring him his clarinet. [the episode then ends]",

  "synopsis": "After four days in Jellyfish Fields, SpongeBob and Patrick are still silently waiting for the jellyfish to move. Finally, they swim away and they chase it. The plan is for SpongeBob to take one side and Patrick then takes the other. However, as both approach the jellyfish, they end up colliding, letting the jellyfish escape.They continue chasing the jellyfish. They do not watch where they are going and accidentally fall off a cliff, falling way down to a county-like village and landing on a port-a-potty. Many of the trenchbillies gang up on SpongeBob and Patrick and capture them with a rope. They take them to Ma Angler, who says that they are \"awful purdy.\" Ma Angler orders them to an initiation. SpongeBob and Patrick question them and Ma Angler sentences them to a series of challenges, being: a banjo contest, a \"hootin' and hollerin'\" contest, and a wrestling match. SpongeBob and Patrick win the first two competitions but decline to the wrestling match, claiming that they do not like to wrestle.Ma Angler is surprised and asks them what they like to do for fun. SpongeBob claims that they like to play jellyfishing. They show the trenchbillies how to jellyfish and collide, once again. Ma Angler enjoys this. The trenchbillies laugh at them and call them dumb. Ma Angler certifies them as official honorary trenchbillies and gives the pair sets of novelty teeth.SpongeBob gives a short speech before he and Patrick attempt to leave, however, they are stopped by a group of trenchbillies. Cletus Junior of the trenchbillies says that they have to take care of Ma Angler for the rest of their lives. SpongeBob and Patrick try to convince them to let them leave but the trenchbillies will not let them. As a result, Patrick stalls them long enough for him and SpongeBob to escape.Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs and Squidward lightly chat about business and then SpongeBob and Patrick burst through the door. They tell the pair of what occurred but Mr. Krabs is unconcerned until they reveal that the trenchbillies followed them. SpongeBob and his friends hide while the trenchbillies destroy the restaurant out of anger. They soon demand the group reveal themselves before Mr. Krabs nervously asks them for their orders. They all order something to eat. Afterwards, Mr. Krabs is pleased by the business and tells SpongeBob to keep cooking. He soon sees that Ma Angler, who is eating a lot of Krabby Patties, remarking will make Customer of the Week. However, he is confronted by Cletus Junior and one of the trenchbillies who sees Mr. Krabs making \"goo-goo eyes at the Ma Angler\" and as the episode ends, Mr. Krabs is forced to get \"hitched\" (married) to Ma Angler. Mr. Krabs screams at this unfortunate fate while his friends congratulate him.",

Ma Angler: Jellyfishin'. What kinda tomfoolery is jellyfishin'? SpongeBob: Well, it goes something like this: [SpongeBob and Patrick pull out their nets and start running around and dancing] Cletus: What-the? Ma Angler: That's disgustin'. SpongeBob: Now, Patrick!

  "synopsis": "One day, SpongeBob and Patrick are playing leapfrog, when they land in a bush. They destroy it, and the two find a worm that lived in the bush, and they name it Mr. Wormsley. SpongeBob takes it home and introduces him to Gary, who takes an immediate dislike to it. They fight, and SpongeBob pulls them apart. Later that night, SpongeBob lets his new pet stay where Gary usually sleeps, and Gary is sent to the guest room, which he does not like.The next morning, SpongeBob wakes up and sees the worm is in a type of pain. He runs to Patrick because he does not know what to do. They go back to SpongeBob's house and see that the worm has given birth to baby worms. SpongeBob and Patrick try and put Gary and Mrs. Wormsley together, but she attacks Gary again, and Gary chases Mrs. Wormsley out of town on a bus, so SpongeBob is left to take care of the worm babies. Because Patrick is not willing to help with this situation, SpongeBob tries to find a person who will adopt the baby worms.He first takes the worms to Squidward's house. Squidward is disgusted by them for vomiting a type of acid at his face. He then takes it to Mrs. Puff, in which she is shocked by them and puffs, damaging her house. SpongeBob then proceeds to go to a grocery store, stumbling upon Larry the Lobster. He decides to take them, but only to eat them alive due to raw protein, in which SpongeBob knocks them out of Larry's hand. The worms land in the middle of the road right in front of a moving truck, in which SpongeBob reacts. He goes inside the truck to pull out the connections to the engine, and unscrews and gets rid of the engine, forcing the truck to halt.SpongeBob then scoops up the meadow worms and puts them in the box that they were in. After this, SpongeBob tries to sell them to Mr. Krabs, in which he declines because the worms spit up on his face as well, and forces him to take the worms out of his restaurant. SpongeBob puts them by the garbage, but the babies spit on him too. Garbage men come up and they are about to take the garbage away when they see the acid on SpongeBob's face. They see that it is a very rare type of worm, and Mr. Krabs comes out, hearing how it is rare and they would bring a lot of money. As the episode ends, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs sell the worms to the people of Bikini Bottom.",

  "transcript": "Patrick: Okay, SpongeBob! It's your turn! I'm ready! SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick! Here I come! [runs and leaps over Patrick] Patrick: Nice landing! [rolls, leaps and lands on his head and hands] Darn, I missed. SpongeBob, look out for my body! [They both fall off a mountain and land on a nest.] SpongeBob: Patrick, maybe we should play something that involves less thinking. Patrick: Okay. SpongeBob: Hey! Maybe we can play a game with this ball that was buried under here! Patrick: Ball! Let me see it! [a ball turns itself into a worm] What a weird ball. SpongeBob: Well, who knows how long it... Ah! Mother of Neptune! Get away from me! Get away from me! Patrick: There's nothing to be afraid of, SpongeBob. It's just a little worm. See? SpongeBob: You're right, Patrick. I'm sorry we destroyed your nest, little worm. I promise it won't happen again. [Mrs. Wormsley rubs her head on SpongeBob's hand] Look, Patrick! Patrick: Looks like he's taking a fancy to you. SpongeBob: Yeah. Hey! Why don't we invite Mr. Wormsley to stay at my place? At least until his nest grows back. Patrick: That sounds delightful! [cuts to scene where SpongeBob and Patrick arrive at SpongeBob's place.] SpongeBob: Gary! [knocks the door] Make yourself descent. [laughs] You have a visitor. [Gary went to sleep, then wakes up.] Gary, wake up. [opens the door, whispered] That's right, just bring in here. Careful, careful now. That's right. Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Gary, are you ready to meet your new friend? Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: That's right, say hello to Mr. Wormsley. [shows Mrs. Wormsley, then Gary hissed at her and Mrs. Wormsley barks at him, they start to growl at each other.] Patrick: Something tells me they don't like each other. SpongeBob: Come on, now. Guys, come on. Let's touch soft spots in a friendly manner. See? You're just saying hi. That's right. There you go, that's it. Oh, I knew you could get along. There, there you go. See? Friends. [Gary sticks to SpongeBob in fright and meows scaredly.] Oh, my goodness! Patrick, oh! Oh, Patrick, please do something! [screams] Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob, I gotta get going. See you later now. SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, see you later then. [SpongeBob resumes screaming] Oh, get it off me! Somebody, please! Please! [Cut to the scene tonight] SpongeBob: All right, Gary, just so there isn't more upset, I'm gonna ask that you sleep on the guest newspaper tonight, and Mr. Wormsley is going to be sleeping in here with me. [Gary growls at Mrs. Wormsley. SpongeBob picks him up.] Now, now, Gary, there's no need for protest. [SpongeBob opens the door. And turns on the lights.] See? I set it all nice just for you. There you are. [SpongeBob leaves.] Night, Gare. [SpongeBob closes the door.] Gary: Meow. [Cut to the scene next morning. SpongeBob is seen sleeping. Then, he wakes up because of some howling.] SpongeBob: Oh, sounds like Patrick is having one of his night fits again. I'll just close the window. [still hears some howling] Mr. Wormsley! [SpongeBob takes off the newspaper revealing Mrs. Wormsley howling, and a big belly, meaning she's giving birth.] Whoa! I'm gonna go get help. Whatever's wrong with you, don't move! Just, uh, read the sports section or something. [Cut to the scene later with Patrick.] SpongeBob: He's in here. [Patrick enters the door] No, I can't look! Patrick: SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Yes? Patrick: Something tells me Mr. Wormsley is actually a Mrs. Wormsley. [SpongeBob stares in a shocked silence and Patrick shows baby worms] SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, it\u2019s a miracle! Patrick: That it is. SpongeBob: Wait 'til Gary sees. Patrick: Yeah! Wait 'til... SpongeBob: See, Gare? Right in here. They're gone asleep. [Mrs. Wormley and Gary are growling at each other again.] Patrick: Looks like they still aren't quite used to each other. SpongeBob: Well, these things take time. [Gary and Mrs. Wormsley get into a fight very quickly.] SpongeBob and Patrick: Duck and cover! [They both hide behind the bed. SpongeBob pops his head up a little bit, as well as Patrick, until Gary and Mrs. Wormsley both arrive close and they both duck behind the bed again. Gary and Mrs. Wormsley get outside of SpongeBob's house] Patrick: This town is getting too rough for me. [We're outside. Gary and Mrs. Wormsley are still having a fight, until they climb up on a hill.] Gary: [chases Mrs. Wormsley away furiously] Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow! [Mrs. Wormsley arrives at a bus stop. The bus comes and picks her up. Gary heads back.] SpongeBob: He's chased her away. Now who will care for her abandoned litter of adorable newborn infants? Patrick: Well, maybe you could take care of them. SpongeBob: Oh, no way, Patrick. I've never seen Gary that upset. Patrick: Ga... who? SpongeBob: Nope, you and I are just gonna have to find loving homes for each and every one of these little guys. Right, Patrick? [door slams] Patrick? [Patrick is gone. Cut to SpongeBob at Squidward's house] Don't worry, little guys. Squidward is a really good friend of mine, and he really likes pets. Squidward: [opens door, yawning] SpongeBob, what are you doing here? Don't you know that it's 7:00 in the morning? SpongeBob: Squidward, I came over with a very special surprise. Squidward: Don't you know that it's 7:00 in the morning? SpongeBob: How would you like to have your very own pet baby worms? Squidward: Don't you know that it's 7:00 in the... [interrupts himself] baby what? SpongeBob: Baby worms. See? Aren't they just adorable at that age? Squidward: [glances into the box holding the worms. One oozes green glistening slime on Squidward's face] SpongeBob: So, how many did you want? [Squidward shuts the door in SpongeBob's face. Cut to Mrs. Puff's house, where SpongeBob presses the doorbell] Mrs. Puff: Yes? Oh, it's you, SpongeBob. What are you, uh, doing here? [laughs] And not that the teacher's most enthusiastic student isn't welcome in her house. [notices SpongeBob still ringing the doorbell and sighs. SpongeBob looks down at the ground and finally lets go of the doorbell.] SpongeBob: Good morning, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: It almost was. SpongeBob: Would you like a baby worm? Mrs. Puff: A what? [screams. Inflates her body to break some of her house in pieces] SpongeBob: Uh, I'll just come back later, Mrs. Puff. Have a nice day! Mrs. Puff: [house collapses] I hate Mondays. SpongeBob: Don't worry, little worms. I know a place where we can find go to find homes for every single one of you. [cuts to supermarket] Good morning, ma'am. How are you today? Could I interest you in some... [lady just keeps walking] Ma'am? [Larry comes out of the Supermarket whistling] That whistling. It's Larry Lobster! Hi, Larry, what are you up to? Larry: Do I know you? SpongeBob: Probably not. Larry: I was just picking up some dietary supplements here at the supermarket. I've been working on my chest... and buns. SpongeBob: So I see. Larry: Well, catch you later. SpongeBob: Oh, Larry, wait. Larry: No time now. Somewhere, there's sand that needs kicking. SpongeBob: Okay. I was just gonna see if you wanted one of these poor, lonely baby worms. Larry: Baby worms? SpongeBob: Well, yeah! Larry: I'll take them off your hands. SpongeBob: Really? Larry: Sure, why not? That's just what the nutritionist ordered: raw protein! [is about to eat the worms] SpongeBob: Larry, no! [jumps into Larry's stomach, knocking him down and sending the box flying] Larry: Dude, nice hustle. [The box lands in the middle of an intersection, with an 18-wheeler headed straight for it. SpongeBob lets out a bloodcurdling scream, flails his arms and babbles incoherently. Larry launches SpongeBob into the air with his abs and he lands on the hood of the truck. He slides down, pulls the vent apart, and crawls inside. He pulls out three plugs, then peeks outside. The truck is still going. Then he notices a loose screw. He unscrews it completely with a wrench, causing the engine to fall out of the bottom of the truck and the truck to stop completely, in the nick of time.] SpongeBob: Oh, little wormies, I'm so glad you're safe. Now let's go see about finding you those homes I promised. [the phone rings] Hello? Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, it's Mr. Krabs. I've been looking all over for you. You're three hours late for work! [SpongeBob screams] Hello? SpongeBob: [runs into the Krusty Krab out of breath] I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, I came as fast as I could-- Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, are you sure you're feeling shipshape? SpongeBob: [pants] I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. My pet worm had babies and got chased away. Now I've got to find them all a place to live. Mr. Krabs: Babies? SpongeBob: Yeah. Mr. Krabs: Let me see. SpongeBob: Really? Mr. Krabs: Yeah, come on, let me see them. I like babies. SpongeBob: Well, okay. Mr. Krabs: [in baby talk] Hey there, little critters. [looks inside the box] Come to... [one of the worms spits green bile onto his face] SpongeBob: Oh, he likes you. Mr. Krabs: [very angry] Get that disgusting vermin out of me restaurant, pronto! [SpongeBob is shocked by this reaction, and runs out of the Krusty Krab sobbing] Blech! [bubble transition to the back of the Krusty Krab] SpongeBob: [inside a garbage can with the worms, depressed] Oh, well. At least I still have you guys. [gets sprayed on by the worms as a garbage truck drives up and stops] Garbage Fish #1: Hmm... [removes some goo from SpongeBob's face with two fingers and sniffs it] Garbage Fish #2: What is it? Garbage Fish #1: I'd recognize this goo anywhere. It comes from a baby spotted glistening meadow worm, the rarest of its species. Garbage Fish #2: Dude, those things are worth a fortune. Mr. Krabs: Did you say \"fortune?\" [His eyes show dollar symbols] [later, Mr. Krabs is talking through a megaphone and trying to sell worms] $5.99, that's right. Get them while they last. Don't be shy, folks. Female fish: These things are so cute! [hands some money to Mr. Krabs and receives back a worm] SpongeBob: Enjoy your new home, little guy. Female fish: Isn't he just adorable? [gets sprayed on by her new baby worm. She laughs, the crowd cheers] SpongeBob: That sure was a great idea you had, Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs: Well, it's like they always say back in the old country, lad. SpongeBob: What's that? Mr. Krabs: I don't know. I've never been to the old country! [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs both laugh, ending the episode]",

  "synopsis": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob is preparing popcorn for himself and Gary. The popcorn flies into his living room and he settles down to watch television, when a commercial comes on for a magic kit, which SpongeBob decides to order.4 to 6 weeks later, SpongeBob receives the kit in the mail and decides to show Squidward his skills in the magical arts. He tries to demonstrate a card trick to Squidward, but the latter escapes from under the former's nose. He then heads out of Bikini Bottom on a bus passing by. Meanwhile, a boatmobile passes by and Monroe is unhappy because his ice cream cone is pistachio. His father doesn't understand why he dislikes pistachio when he asked for it. Soon, the boatmobile hits a crack and the kid's pistachio ice cream cone flies out, which causes the kid to cry even more, and lands onto Squidward's chair. Because of this, SpongeBob thinks he has turned Squidward into an ice cream cone and promises him that he will still be able to live a normal life after he seems unable to change \"Squidward\" back to his normal self.Some time later at Goo Lagoon, SpongeBob notices the Squidward ice cream cone is melting in the sun, forcing SpongeBob to rush it home and put the Squidward ice cream cone in the freezer. Patrick then shows up, and SpongeBob explains what has happened to him. Patrick attempts to eat the Squidward ice cream cone, but the Squidward ice cream cone melts. Just then, SpongeBob realizes that Mr. Magic can help them, so he and Patrick pay him a visit along with the melted Squidward ice cream cone gathered inside a jar.The floating fish head tells them that he cannot help SpongeBob, and then Patrick notices a leg sticking out from behind a curtain. Behind the curtain, a fish is talking into a microphone, and saying exactly what Mr. Magic is saying. The fish claims he is technically Mr. Magic, but he cannot help SpongeBob as he is only a businessman and not a real wizard. SpongeBob is furious because of this and exclaims loudly that his faith in the magical arts is ruined, before Mr. Magic gets security to kick SpongeBob and Patrick out.Back in the neighborhood, SpongeBob is still grieving while yelling out random magic words, when Squidward shows up and throws the jar of melted ice cream away; Patrick witnesses this. SpongeBob sees Squidward and believes his magic words turned him back to normal and that he really is magic. He then offers to transform Squidward into something else, but he runs away, yet again. In the end, Patrick later requests SpongeBob to turn him into a jar of mayonnaise. SpongeBob does so, and amazingly, it works.",

Squidward: Magic? Can you make yourself disappear, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: [laughs] Silly Squidward. I won't learn vanishing spells until I become a level 10 wizard. [Squidward's eye twitches] No, I better start with something simpler. [gets out a deck of cards] Say card conjuring. [Squidward is now very sad] Here, hold this simple, playing card while I transform it into a magic playing card before your very eyes. Let's see... [reads his book of spells] step 1... Squidward: [sighs] This can't possibly end soon. SpongeBob: Which brings us to... step three. Juggle something. Well, if you insist, Mister Magic. [juggles the three balls in and out of his holes on his body] Squidward: [steps onto the bus that just pulled up] I don't care where I'm going, just take me away from here. [bus drives off] SpongeBob: Then take one card and shove it in your ear. [does so. A car drives by with Tom in the driver's seat and his son Monroe in the passenger seat bawling] Monroe: But I don't like pistachio! Tom: Then why did you ask for it? [drives into a bump, which causes the ice cream to fly out the car and into Squidward's lawn chair. Monroe briefly stops crying and then starts crying loudly again] [The pistachio ice cream cone lands in Squidward's sunbathing chair] SpongeBob: And finally, say the words \"Hobris-Pobris.\" [gasps] Squidward! My simple card-trick has turned you into an ice cream cone. Which means... I am a level ten wizard! I suppose I should change you back to squid form. [looks at his book of spells] Presto! [nothing happens] Uh, let's see. Umm... A-ha! Alakazam! [gasps] Abracadabra. [gasps] Okilee-dokilee. Hobra-cobra. Oh! Open sesame. Change-o back-o to Squidward-o, please-o? Oh, I am so sorry, Squidward. [sniffs, tears up] I've transformed you into a delicious dairy dessert and I can't change you back! There, there, Squidward. There is no need to cry. I promise you will continue your normal life despite the fact that you are now edible. [Cut to \"The Reef\" where SpongeBob and Squidward, as an ice cream cone, are watching a movie. Ice cream cone tilts over into SpongeBob's arm and makes him smile. Cut to SpongeBob reading Squidward a story. Cut to the beach where SpongeBob and Squidward are lying on a towel trying to get a tan. SpongeBob looks over and notices the ice cream cone that is melting from the sun] SpongeBob: Whoa-oh! [the sunglasses fall off of the ice cream, SpongeBob couldn't open the ice until a beach goer, who is trying to catch a Frisbee, slips in the ice cream cone. SpongeBob screams, then runs over to Squidward] Squidward! Speak to me! Speak! [breathes heavily as he runs to his house and puts the cone in the freezer] Hey, Squid, are you okay? [closes freezer door then reopens it] Hey, Squid, are you still okay? [winks, then closes door, reopens it again screaming then laughing] Hey, Squidward, I got something for ya! Someone to keep you company in that drab ol' freezer. [set a pink ice cream cone next to Squidward] Oh, aren't they cute? I promise to stand by as an eternal guard over my buddy. Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob, whatcha doing? SpongeBob: I have turned poor Squidward into a frozen dessert. Patrick: That's awful. How tragic. Poor Squidward. SpongeBob: It's all my fault. Patrick: Did you say frozen dessert? [takes the green ice cream cone out of the freezer] SpongeBob: Yeah. I turned him into a tasty soft-serve with a waffle cone. [cries] Patrick: Oh...soft serve. [licks ice cream cone] SpongeBob: [yells as he points to the ice cream] Patrick! Stop eating Squidward! Patrick: Oh, sorry. [licks it a few more times] SpongeBob: Patrick! [Patrick licks it again] Pat...! Patrick: [frantically] But he's so tasty! [licks it more faster. SpongeBob screams, then he snatches the cone away from Patrick] SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! Don't you understand!? [calmly] This isn't just your ordinary ice cream cone. Patrick: It's pistachio. SpongeBob: [frustrated] No! It's Squidward! [ice cream begins to melt as SpongeBob is unaware] And no matter what happens, I promised him that I would watch over him to ensure his soft, frozen life is unchanged. [Patrick is licking the melted ice cream off the floor. SpongeBob screams again, believing that his friend was deceased.] Patrick! Squidward has melted! Quick, call the police. What am I going to do?! Oh, Neptune, it's all my fault! What have I done?! What have I done?! [screams and hits himself in the face with the magic kit each time] It's all your fault! [throws the magic kit on the ground and stomps on it] Curse you, Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit! Curse you! Hey, that's it! That's the answer to our problems! Patrick: [examines the torn box] Warning: From ages 9 to 99. SpongeBob: No, Patrick, the one mystic being that can help us: Mister Magic! [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick walking down a brown tileroad] Just follow the brown-tiled road to the most mysterious mystic of them all! No one's ever seen him in person. Deep male voice: Enter! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to a floating hat] Who dares to see Mister Magic?! [SpongeBob and Patrick are screaming] Speak up! SpongeBob: It is I, SpongeBob of the SquarePants, Magician Level 1. And I have turned my friend into ice cream. [he shows him the cone floating in the melted green goo inside a jar, which is his \"deceased friend\"] Mister Magic: [proudly] Good job. SpongeBob: Well, thank you, but well, I can't change him back. Mister Magic: Hmmm, um, well, have you ever thought of a different hobby? SpongeBob: I need your help to change him back. Mister Magic: My help? [sheepishly] Uh, no thank you. SpongeBob: [still concerned] But if you don't, my friend will be a cone forever. Mister Magic: Sorry, I... umm... I'm out to lunch, that's it. SpongeBob: I'll wait. Mister Magic: I'm on a two-year lunch. SpongeBob: [still showing the jar] Oh, please. Mister Magic: Silence! [Patrick notices something near the wall and walks to it] SpongeBob: But, sir, no one else has your power of sorcery. [Patrick opens the curtain to reveal someone behind it making Mister Magic talk] Mister Magic: Thank... you. Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, there's a guy over here talking into a tubey thing. Horace: Uhh, ignore your friend. The fish you see is only an illusion. Mister Magic: [simultaneously with Horace] Uhh, ignore your friend. The fish you see is only an illusion. Patrick: Why's he saying the same thing Mister Magic's saying? SpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick. Who are you, good sir? Horace: Well, I... uh... I'm Horace B. Magic. SpongeBob: Are you Mister Magic? Horace: [chuckles] Technically, yes. But the only magic around here is the magic of business. [shows a bunch of dollar bills] SpongeBob: Does that mean you can't change my friend back? Horace: [chuckles] I'm, I'm afraid not. So sorry about that, laddie. Your refund check is in the mail. SpongeBob: I don't need a refund, I want my friend back! This isn't about money. You're nothing but a fake--just a lying, corporate businessman, tainting the purity of magic with your corrupt commercial ways! [his eyes tear up] You have ruined my faith in the magical arts. [screaming, crying] Horace: [frowns] Security. [SpongeBob and Patrick are booted out. Cut to both of them by Squidward's lawn chair with SpongeBob still crying over the \"funeral\" held for \"Squidward\"] SpongeBob: [tears roll down his cheeks] What are we going to do about Squidward? Patrick: We could always eat him. I'm kind of hungry. [stomach growls] SpongeBob: Mister Magic was a fake and all his magic stuff is fake! All those magic words, they were fake. Yacky, shmacky, bappy, dappy, doppy, blabby, flabby, murkery, fool, magic of bloob-jiggacacies!... [continues to speak gibberish as a bus drives up and Squidward steps off, grinning in a friendly manner. He walks over to the lawn chair with the jar and the melted green ice cream, much to his disgust] Squidward: Ew. [throws the jar with the cone in it away. The jar breaks] What are you doing, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: [stops crying] Squidward! You're back. The magic words worked. [puts on his magician hat] I really am magical after all. Can I turn you into something else, now? [motorcycle approaches] Squidward: Hey, stop! [motorcycle stops and Squidward jumps on it] Get me out of here! Patrick: [stomach growls] Hey, SpongeBob? I'm still hungry. Can you turn me into a jar of mayonnaise so I can eat myself? SpongeBob: Sure, buddy. Patrick-a mayonnaise-ica! [Patrick is now a giant jar of mayonnaise. The jar sparkles]",

  "synopsis": "Mr. Krabs, to increase profits and decrease costs, puts SpongeBob into a chef exchange program. SpongeBob goes to work for a restaurant named Fancy!, while the head chef, Le Schnook, works for the Krusty Krab.Things do not start well for SpongeBob, as the owner, Mr. Crustacean demands that he cook quality gourmet. Unfortunately, SpongeBob is quite literally incapable of cooking anything but Krabby Patties, to the degree where he cannot even fry an egg without it instantly transforming into a patty. Mr. Crustacean continues to yell at him until he actually tastes a patty. Realizing how good it tastes, he begins to sell them, which all the rich clienteles enjoy. Eventually, SpongeBob's time there is up and he is about to return to the Krusty Krab. Unfortunately, that is not what Mr. Crustacean or the customers want. They attach themselves to his ankles and beg him not to go. SpongeBob has to drag them out of the restaurant.Meanwhile, things are not going well at the Krusty Krab. Le Schnook is none too pleased by Mr. Krabs' cheap attempts of setting up a lavish establishment. He refuses to cook unless his demands for expensive furniture, ingredients, and real silverware are met. As a result, the Krusty Krab goes completely bankrupt and out of business.Mr. Krabs sells the decorations, his home possessions, his office desk, and his chair, along with Squidward to pay his debts and protect himself from the angry loan sharks. Pearl even calls him, thinking that their house has been infiltrated by burglars; Mr. Krabs assures his daughter that they are just repo men. Before returning to Fancy!, Le Schnook gives Mr. Krabs a long bill for his services. Mr. Krabs breaks down crying, realizing what giving away SpongeBob cost him. It is at this time that SpongeBob returns with a massive chain of customers still attached to his ankles. Mr. Krabs is delighted and apologizes for ever letting him go.The episode then concludes with the reopening of the Krusty Krab, followed by old, new, and rich clientele happily eating Krabby Patties off the floor. Squidward asks if they should even be eating on the floor. Mr. Krabs responds that the only thing they need is food and love.",

  "transcript": "SpongeBob: [Starts with scene of the Krusty Krab zooming in, then we see SpongeBob ringing the bell] Order up! Go now, and bless the taste buds of your lucky connoisseur. [blows a kiss then a heart pops up and Squidward accidentally swallows it and starts choking] Squidward: It went in my mouth! Choking on sentiment! I think I'm poisoned! SpongeBob: Well, okay, you sit this one out, Squidward, this will be a special delivery from the chef. [talking to customer] For your dining pleasure, two double Krabby Patties cooked to perfection complimented by a side of coral bits and a jumbo diet soda, topped off with a little extra love. [reaches into his chest and pulls out a heart and sprinkles some of it on the Krabby Patties. He then pants] Enjoy your meal! [sighs] It's the little details that they really appreciate, isn't it, Squidward? Squidward: [breathes] Oh, yeah, you really touched his life. [cuts to scene of customer eating his Krabby Patties like a pig] SpongeBob: Nothing beats making quality food for good people with discriminating tastes. Squidward: Quality food? SpongeBob: Yeah! Squidward: Good people? SpongeBob: Uh-huh. [nods] Squidward: Discriminating tastes? SpongeBob: Testify! Squidward: D'oh! [breathes angrily, then runs up to customer and takes the Krabby Patty from him] Only pathetic losers with horrible taste would eat this garbage! SpongeBob: [gasps in shock. The customer starts crying. SpongeBob runs up to him and starts cradling him.] Squidward! The Krusty client\u00e8le needs to be cuddled and treated with respect. [takes Krabby Patty from Squidward and puts it in customers mouth like a baby bottle] There, there. [to Squidward] Mr. Krabs will be ashamed! [Mr. Krabs walks in] Mr. Krabs: All right, you filthy bilge rats! SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs: You got three seconds to get out of me restaurant before I kick you out! Fine, have it your way! [goes around to the back of the Krusty Krab and starts tipping it and all the customers fall out and then puts it back and walks into the Krusty Krab] SpongeBob: What's happening, Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs: Ah, we don't need those losers anymore! I'm turning the restaurant in to one of those fancy froufrou places, where they charge big bucks for itsy-bitsy portions! Squidward: Fancy? Froufrou? Mr. Krabs: We're getting a gourmet chef from the chef exchange program and I'm going to raise me prices to the roof! [laughs] SpongeBob: Chef exchange program? Mr. Krabs: [stops laughing] Oh. Uh, yeah. Well, you'll be shipped off to some other restaurant somewhere far away from here! Uh details are kinda hazy, but I packed your bags and your bus leaves in five minutes! [bus arrives] Heh, looks like it's early. [kicks SpongeBob into the bus and it drives off] Squidward: It was that easy? All these years? [sniffles] I've underestimated the power of public transportation! [another bus arrives with Le Schnook on it] Mr. Krabs: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. Squidward: Does your middle name happen to be \"No SpongeBob within a thousand kilometers of here\"? [he and Mr. Krabs laugh] Le Schnook: I find you disgusting. [they stop laughing] However, my culture dictates zat I must kiss you regardless. [kisses Squidward on each cheek, then spits twice before doing the same with Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs: Well, he's just as affectionate as the boy. Squidward: But the surly attitude he has is a step in the right direction! [cuts to scene of the bus dropping off SpongeBob at the Fancy! restaurant. SpongeBob then walks into the kitchen] Mr. Crustacean: What is this rubbish?! I would not wipe my own bottom with this! [slaps Incidental 2 who is holding a steak] Start over! And this! [drinks boiled water, then spits it on Paco] I would not wash my own bottom with this after carefully wiping and wiping and wiping! [slaps Paco] Now go stand in the corner and think about what you have done! [Paco walks away sadly] And where is my exchange chef?! SpongeBob: Um, right here, sir. Mr. Crustacean: [laughs] There you are. Bonjour! [kisses SpongeBob two times, SpongeBob giggles and the chief slaps him] Now, get to your station and prepare me your best dish! [SpongeBob runs to a pot, puts some ingredients into it, then takes out a Krabby Patty and blows a kiss and a heart shows up. The chef then grabs it and crushes it] This is not funny! And I certainly did not exchange my top sous chef for a, how you say, comedian! [puts Krabby Patty in SpongeBob's mouth and then pulls is nose causing him to eat it] Prepare me a gourmet dish, NOW! [SpongeBob runs over to a counter with vegetables on it] SpongeBob: [starts chopping vegetables] I'm sure with all my years in the kitchen, I can make something other than... [chops vegetables into a Krabby Patty then laughs nervously] Just warming up. [Chief gets angry, he then screams than gets a tray of stuff and puts in in the oven] Come on, SpongeBob! [whistles and then takes out a Krabby Patty and throws it on the ground, Chief gets angry again, he then cracks an egg into a pan] Just one egg then... [egg turns into a Krabby Patty and SpongeBob gets mad and throws it on the ground along with many other Krabby Patties] No, that's not it either... Mr. Crustacean: You are making a mockery of my... [Krabby Patty accidentally lands in his mouth and he eats it] This taste is... is fantastic! What do you call it? [he then eats another one] SpongeBob: A Krabby Patty. Mr. Crustacean: [is eating more Krabby Patties] The whole world must taste this! French Narrator: Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab... [We see that the Krusty Krab is all decorated fancy] Mr. Krabs: Hey, Squidward, look at this! [holds up a plate with a small fruit on it] We're charging 52 smackeroos for this little guy. [laughs and then Squidward smells its horrible odor] Squidward: Oh! What is that?! Mr. Krabs: I don't know! Some kind of bean paste or something. Le Schnook: Wrong, monsieur! It is ze Rare Fruit of ze Kazook Tree. Mr. Krabs: So it's supposed to smell like a rotten gym socks? Le Schnook: Its naturally rancid odor can only be neutralized by shredded gold. Mr. Krabs: Shredded... [gulps] gold? [Le Schnook then starts shredding gold with a cheese grater. Mr. Krabs screams and takes it away from him] Couldn't we use less expensive ingredients? Le Schnook: Price can be no object when it comes to dealing with exquisite food like zis. It must be prepared with only the finest ingredients, and eaten with only the finest silverware, while sitting on the finest furniture! [Le Schnook tries to sit in one of the chair, but it is just a billboard] Zis... is not ze chair I ordered. Mr. Krabs: Yeah, well you see those were out of stock. Le Schnook: And zis fork of plastic... Spray painted to look silver, is it not? [Mr. Krabs starts to sweat, chuckling nervously. Le Schnook gets back up, dusting himself] I cannot prepare food UNDER ZESE CONDITIONS! [cuts back to the Fancy! restaurant where there is a big line and everybody is eating Krabby Patties] Mr. Crustacean: Monsieur SpongeBob, although it is in direct violation of our chef exchange program rules, let me assure you that these kisses are not merely a formality. They are genuine! [kisses SpongeBob twice] I am sure that this is only the beginning of a long and... [SpongeBob's alarm on his wrist watch rings] SpongeBob: Well, my time here is up. I am officially a Krusty Krab employee once again! [is about to walk out, but the chef stops him] Mr. Crustacean: I apologize, Monsieur SpongeBob, but you can see that my customers had grown rather fond of your Krabby Patties. SpongeBob: [gasps] The Krabby Patties, I almost forgot! These babies also belong to the Krusty Krab! [starts taking all the Krabby Patties and putting them in a sack and then puts it in his suitcase] So long! [customers gasp and SpongeBob begins to leave and one customer holds on to his leg] Customer: Wait, just one more? SpongeBob: I'm sorry, but I've got to go. [all customers hold on to his leg. However, he manages to get out. The scene switches to the Krusty Krab and it has a sign that reads \u201cout of business\u201d because it went bankrupt. Inside the restaurant, repo men are seen hauling away the fancy furniture. We then see Mr. Krabs crying in his office] Mr. Krabs: I'm ruined! Busted! [phone then rings and Mr. Krabs answers it] Hello? Pearl: [on phone] Daddy, the house is full of burglars. [Mr. Krabs laughs] Mr. Krabs: No, those aren't burglars, Pearl. Those are just friendly repo men. [Mr. Krabs hangs up and notices Squidward being held on to by his arms by two other repo men] Squidward: Mr. Krabs, tell these guys to let go of me! Mr. Krabs: Uh, well, you know, until I come up with the money I owe, I'm afraid you'll be staying with these nice gents. Squidward: You sold me?! Mr. Krabs: No! Bartered is more like it. They keep you, I keep my kneecaps. Repo Man: Come on, mac! [takes him away] Squidward: You're pathetic! [Le Schnook then walks in] Mr. Krabs: Oh, Mr. Le Schnook... I lost everything! I'm bankrupt! You and your fancy eats are all I got left now. Le Schnook: Not quite. My time in the chef's exchange program has expired. So my \"eats\" and I are leaving. [hands Mr. Krabs a bill] This is for you. Mr. Krabs: Is it money? Le Schnook: It is the bill for my services. [Mr. Krabs unfolds the bill. His eyes become bloodshot, and he is unable to move] Repo Man: One side, please. [Repo men take Mr. Krabs\u2019 desk and chair away while he is sitting in it, a repo man brings Mr. Krabs back into the restaurant lobby. He is set down on the floor. Mr. Krabs starts crying] Mr. Krabs: Oh, I've been such a fool! I turned away SpongeBob, the best fry cook I ever had, and it cost me everything! SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs: Oh, I can still hear his sweet little voice. SpongeBob: [High pitched] Mr. Kra-a-abs?! Mr. Krabs: Okay, now I'm scared. SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs: Darn his cursed mocking voice! I... [notices SpongeBob] SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Ahoy, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, me boy. [hugs SpongeBob] You came back! And you brought customers! [The scene cuts to all customers talking at once. We can hear some of them. Customer #1 says: \"Oh, please, we must have some Krabby Patties. We just adore...\" Customer #2 says: \"Please, Krabby Patties...\" Customer #3 says: \"Krabby Patties, please.\" Customer #4 says: \"Krabby Patties...\"] Mr. Krabs: [now talking to Squidward] Well, Mr. Squidward, all's well that end's well. I got me poor disgusting old client\u00e8le back, and rich disgusting new client\u00e8le to boot! [Rich woman burps] I'm back in business! Squidward: Couldn't you at least give them tables to eat on? Mr. Krabs: Oh, no way. See, I've learned that you can't buy customer loyalty with fancy tables, froufrou food, or even sanitary conditions. Hey, get back you, eat your own. [Mr. Krabs throws them a bucket of Krabby Patties, the customers squeal like pigs] Nope, just good food prepared with love. Ain't that right, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: You got it, Mr. Krabs. [Blows another kiss, Squidward swallows it and starts choking. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh]",
