  "synopsis": [
   "The episode starts at Bikini Bottom Boats, where SpongeBob is being suggested numerous boatmobiles by a boat salesperson. The one that catches his attention the most is the self-driving car, Coupe, which he then buys. He shows his brand-new boat to Squidward and Mrs. Puff, who are really surprised that SpongeBob had the ability to obtain such a fancy vehicle.At night, SpongeBob parks Coupe in his respective lot, but Coupe wants to be inside the house since it began raining, so SpongeBob carves a large quantity of his pineapple house to accommodate Coupe. The latter wants to sleep on SpongeBob's bed, leaving SpongeBob and Gary no choice but to sleep outside in the rain due to Coupe honking when he snores.The following day, SpongeBob uses Coupe to get to the Krusty Krab and picks up Patrick, but Coupe ejects him after the latter annoys him with pushing his buttons. Arriving at the restaurant, he disapproves of being seen around the restaurant since he thinks it is too disgusting for his fanciness. As a result, instead of letting SpongeBob go to work, he forces him to do what he wants, which involves being pampered at an auto repair shop. SpongeBob lyingly claims that he has to use the bathroom, so Coupe sets him free for a moment, unaware of his intentions.However, he suspects that SpongeBob is up to something harmful upon witnessing his buying a bag from the car store. When SpongeBob returns, he takes what is revealed to be a steering wheel out of the bag and installs it to Coupe to get to the Krusty Krab. Coupe prevents SpongeBob from getting to work by restraining him with his seatbelts. To escape from his manipulation, SpongeBob orders a triple Krabby Patty with five scoops of ice cream from the drive-thru and throws it onto Coupe, interfering with his operation. He is eventually lifted by Patrick, who wants the ice cream in which Coupe is covered.SpongeBob gives up his self-driving days. Coupe asks what he plans on doing with him, and ends up becoming a kiddie ride outside of the Krusty Krab. He is rode excessively by Patrick while the latter eats ice cream, much to his misery and suffering, as the episode ends."

   "[The episode begins with SpongeBob pretending to be a stunt driver in one of the boats at the Bikini Bottom Boat store.] SpongeBob: [imitates engine revving] I'm a stunt driver, and I'm making donuts! [screeches] Out of the way! [screeches] Look out! Where'd you learn to drive, buddy? Oh, Mrs. Puff's Boating School? Me too! [laughs] Ahh, the bridge is out! Ahhh! Boat salesperson: That's a sweet little boat. You're a smart shopper. SpongeBob: Oh, I'm not shopping. I'm playing. Boat salesperson: Playing, huh? Well, we have some very playful items here for a\u2014a\u2014 SpongeBob: [acts very goofy] Ehh-ehh. Boat salesperson: ...Sophisticated motorist like yourself. [grabs SpongeBob by the eyes] SpongeBob: Whoa! Boat salesperson: [shows SpongeBob the Nerdmobile] The Nerdmobile. It comes with pocket protectors, corrective lens windshield and seat wedgies. SpongeBob: [gets a wedgie from the Nerdmobile] Ah-ow! Wow. Boat salesperson: No, this isn't right. I got something more your style. [grabs SpongeBob] SpongeBob: Whee! [gets thrown into the Wimp Wagon] Boat salesperson: The Wimp Wagon. It includes unlimited tissues for crying, a security blanket, [a blanket pops out from the steering wheel and SpongeBob sucks his thumb] and a bumper bonnet for your [pushes the bumper bonnet down on SpongeBob] delicate fontanel. SpongeBob: Oh, these are very nice, but I don't have a driver's license. Boat salesperson: No license, huh? Well, you don't need a license to drive a self-driving boat. SpongeBob: Self-driving? [gets pulled out of the Wimp Wagon] Boat salesperson: [shows SpongeBob a platinum self-driving boat] Meet Coupe. It's very classy. Chrome-plated exterior, titanium hubcaps, turbine engine, and personal driver narration. SpongeBob: [wide-eyed] Ooh. Whaaa! [gives the boat salesperson money] Sold! Boat salesperson: Oh, thanks! [laughs as he flies away] SpongeBob: Ahhh! My very own boat. Ah! [jumps into the boat and goes to drive it, but he finds the steering wheel and the key ignition missing] Huh? But there's no key! And no steering wheel! [stammers as he pushes various buttons] Where is that\u2014I gotta\u2014 [a cat meows on the boat's DVD screen] How do you\u2014 [jumps on the seat, until a robot arm grabs him and sits him down] Coupe: Settle down, Mr. SquarePants. SpongeBob: Wow, you talk. How'd you know my name? Coupe: I can feel your square pants on my seat. Where to, Mr. SquarePants? SpongeBob: Oh, why don't we just go for a drive? Coupe: You've got it. SpongeBob: [Coupe fastens the seatbelt around SpongeBob and begins to drive out of the Bikini Bottom Boat store and onto the street] Whoa, careful! And stay in your lane! Stop sign! Stop sign! Truck, truck, truck, truck! [almost gets hit by a truck] Ah! Coupe: Relax, Mr. SquarePants. I'm an expert driver. Make yourself at home and leave everything to me. [pours a cup of tea while SpongeBob has a blanket on and his shoes off, relaxing] Squidward: [looking through the window at a clarinet store] Hmm? Huh? [sees SpongeBob riding Coupe and playing instruments along the way] SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! [blows a clarinet in Squidward's face] Squidward: [bewildered] Oh, I need to erase this from my mind. [pulls his nose to open his head, takes out his brain, erases it clean with a pencil, and puts his brain back in, making him dumb] Duh! What's a SpongeBob?! [drools] SpongeBob: [reads his book until he sees Mrs. Puff driving next to him] Oh, hi, Mrs. Puff. What do you think of my classy new boat? Mrs. Puff: Hello, SpongeBob. SpongeBob! Ah! You're not driving! SpongeBob: I know! Isn't it great? Mrs. Puff: [hears a truck horn honking] Ahhh! [Mrs. Puff swerves her boat and crashes into a junkyard. She then gets smooshed and crushed by the boat-smashing machine and then puffs up. She groans and pulls the boat off of her. Meanwhile, Coupe drives SpongeBob to his house.] SpongeBob: [jumps out] Oh, that was the best day of non-driving ever. Coupe, is there anything I can get you? Warm glass of oil? Triple-foam conditioner? Coupe: I'm fine. Good night, Mr. SquarePants. SpongeBob: Good night, Coupe. [kisses Coupe and goes in his house] [At night, thunder roars and it starts to rain. Coupe honks its horn.] SpongeBob: What's wrong, Coupe? Coupe: I'm getting wet. SpongeBob: [struggles to pull an umbrella from him pants, but it opens inside] Whoa! [pulls the umbrella out] Here, take this! [gives Coupe the umbrella and goes back inside; Coupe honks its horn again] What's up? Coupe: I'm cold. SpongeBob: Aww. [wraps Coupe with a blanket] There you go, my widdle self-driver. Nice and snuggy-wuggy. Coupe: I don't like it out here. I want to be inside. SpongeBob: Inside? [saws a hole big enough for Coupe to fit] All right, Coupe. Come on in. [Coupe drives inside the house and begins flipping the channels with the remote.] SpongeBob: Hey, you know what'd be fun? If I sat in you and we pretended we were in a drive-in movie. Coupe: No, it wouldn't. SpongeBob: Okay, so I guess you're just gonna click through the channels looking for a boat commercial all night, huh? Coupe: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I was a guest here. [shines its lights at SpongeBob's eyes] SpongeBob: Of course you are. [rubs his eyes] Well, I'm tired. You can stay up. I'm going to bed. [goes upstairs] Oh, Coupe? Good-night. I had a wonderful day. [Coupe doesn't listen to SpongeBob and continues flipping the channels. SpongeBob, feeling rejected, sulks upstairs to his room. Moments later while sleeping with Gary, SpongeBob hears a rumbling sound coming up the stairs.] SpongeBob: Ohh! Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Gary, what is that? [the door opens; SpongeBob and Gary hover together in fear; it turns out to be Coupe as it honks its horn; Coupe climbs into SpongeBob's bed, crushing it] Coupe: Sorry, Mr. SquarePants. I'm so... [yawns] SpongeBob: I know, Coupe. You're tired. We're all tired. [Coupe snores through its horn as SpongeBob and Gary go downstairs to sleep on the couch. A few steps crumble from the damage done by Coupe's wheels. A few hours later, SpongeBob and Gary sleep peacefully on the couch. But a loud sound from Coupe's horn startles them both, which resulted in Gary scratching SpongeBob's face.] SpongeBob: Ow. [Now totally feeling rejected and hurt, SpongeBob goes outside in the cold, rainy night with Gary and sleeps on the driveway while holding an umbrella. The next day, SpongeBob, who is extremely tired from such a long night, is making his way to the Krusty Krab. Suddenly, Coupe drives up to SpongeBob.] Coupe: Mr. SquarePants, I can drive you to work. Why are you walking? SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, well, I didn't want to wake you. You were sleeping like a baby. Heh. Baby buggy! [laughs] Baby buggy... [falls asleep] [Coupe grabs SpongeBob, puts him in the driver seat and begins to drive. Suddenly, Coupe accidentally bumps into Patrick.] Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, how about a ride? SpongeBob: Well, sure, Patrick. Hop in. Patrick: Yay! [hops into Coupe's passenger seat; Coupe's horn blares and resumes driving] Oh, oh boy! Buttons! [pushes various buttons with his hands, tongue, and buttocks like a crazy idiot] SpongeBob: [Coupe's wheels stretch out] Uh, Patrick, could you not\u2014 [Coupe spins around] I don't think he\u2014 [the trunk opens and knocks out extra wheels] Don't get your\u2014 Patrick: [laughs] Butt on buttons! SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick, I don't think Coupe likes that. Coupe: [grabs Patrick and sits him down] Passenger, settle down. [smacks Patrick's face with the seatbelt several times for his stupidity and fastens him, making him pop chocolate ice cream out from his bellybutton] SpongeBob: Hey, ice cream. Where's the cone? Patrick: Oh, don't worry. It's down there somewhere. Ahh. [puts ice cream on his tongue and resumes pushing various buttons with his ice cream-covered hands] Coupe: [groans and spits in disgust while Patrick plays with the buttons] Ugh, eww! All right, that's enough! [ejects Patrick out of the passenger seat] Patrick: Thanks for the ride! [Coupe stops at the Krusty Krab.] SpongeBob: Here we are. Coupe: Here we are, where? SpongeBob: Where I work, the Krusty Krab. Coupe: What? I can't be seen here. I'm a classy car. This place is tacky. [the chimney makes a flatulence sound] SpongeBob: [struggles to unhook the seatbelt and open the door, but to no avail] Coupe, open the door! I'll be late! [Coupe drives away] Yow! But I have to go to work! Ah. [sulks into his driver seat] Coupe: You obviously have no taste, so today we're going to do what I want to do. SpongeBob: But I have to go to work. [groans] [Coupe drives over to the boat wash where it is getting scrubbed and clean. SpongeBob is not too thrilled with what Coupe is doing as he is getting sprayed and scrubbed on in his face.] SpongeBob: I have to go to work. [Coupe is now at the garage getting itself waxed, its engine repaired, and its wheel pumped up.] SpongeBob: [growing impatient] But I have to go to work! [Coupe gets its finger nails on its robot hand filed, its wheels massaged and is offered a glass of oil. One of the mechanics gives SpongeBob the bill.] SpongeBob: Huh? [looks at the bill and pays the mechanic] Ugh. I have to go\u2014 Coupe: Go to work? SpongeBob: No, go to the bathroom. Coupe: You can hold it. SpongeBob: Or I could just go. [unzips his pants and Coupe unhooks the seatbelt in disgust] Coupe: Ugh. Make it snappy. [slaps SpongeBob with the seatbelt] SpongeBob: Ow! [groans] [SpongeBob heads out of the garage. But unbeknownst to him, Coupe's headlights turn red and starts scanning like a security camera.] Coupe: Hmm? Hmm. [sees SpongeBob going into the parts store and buying something there] Hmm. [becomes angry] Hmm. SpongeBob: [walks out of the store with a bag and sees Coupe spying on him] Eh? [hides the bag and whistles back into the garage; he goes to the driver seat, but Coupe drive away a few inches] Hmm. [stammers as he tries again, but Coupe drives away again; Coupe drives out of the garage and onto the street] Very funny, Coupe. Very funny. Coupe: What's in the bag? SpongeBob: Oh, nothing. [Coupe drives away] Hey, wait! [jumps into the driver seat] Coupe: What are you doing, SquarePants? SpongeBob: I'm going to work. [pulls out a steering wheel from his bag and jams it onto the control panel; then he jams an accelerator on the bottom and places a bobble-head on the windshield; he floors it and takes control of Coupe by turning it around] Coupe: Ooh. SpongeBob: Did that hurt? Coupe: Of course not. I'm a boat. I don't feel physical pain. SpongeBob: Good to know, [puts on a helmet] because I'm a stunt driver, and I'm making donuts! [SpongeBob spins Coupe around in circles and crashes into a fence.] Coupe: Oh, no you don't. Give me that! [grabs the steering wheel and turns around] [Coupe drives over a cliff and flies towards a first-class hotel.] SpongeBob: Yahh! Valet parking attendant: Ohh! [Coupe crashes through the doors and drives into the lobby.] Coupe: [laughs] Now this is where I should be living! [drives into the elevator] Penthouse parking lot, please. [the bellhop pushes the button on the elevator] Thank you. SpongeBob: Hi, how are you doing today? Good? [whistles] [The elevator reaches the penthouse parking lot on the rooftop. The penthouse parking lot consists of a bed, a gasoline pump, a smoker, palm trees, a stove, a radio stereo, and a pool.] SpongeBob: Well played, Coupe. Coupe: [shakes hands with SpongeBob] Indeed. [giggles] SpongeBob: Because now we can get to the Krusty Krab the fast way! [steers Coupe off the roof] Coupe: What? No! No! Noooo! [lands near the Krusty Krab] No, you don't! [SpongeBob tries to break free, but Coupe ties him up with the seatbelt] No, no, we're not going into the tacky Krusty Krab! SpongeBob: You're right, we're going through the drive-thru! [steers Coupe through the drive-thru with his tongue] Triple Krabby Patty with five scoops of ice cream, please. [strains as Coupe drives to the drive-thru window; Squidward gives SpongeBob his order while SpongeBob keeps fighting with Coupe] Squidward, you see me struggling with this boat, and you act like you don't care! Squidward: It's not an act. [closes the drive-thru window as Coupe drives away from the Krusty Krab] SpongeBob: [takes out his Triple Krabby Patty with ice cream] I hate to do this to you, Triple Krabby Patty with five scoops of ice cream, but I have no choice. [throws the ice cream-filled patty on the control panel] Coupe: No, no, stop! I don't like that! [screeches its tires as it drives out of control] Patrick: [appears on the road] Hey, SpongeBob! Coupe: Oh, not this idiot again! SpongeBob: Ahhh! [Patrick stops Coupe and lifts it up to lick the ice cream from the radiator] Patrick: Ah, I thought I smelled ice cream. [licks more ice cream] SpongeBob: My self-driving days are over. Coupe: What do you plan on doing with me, SquarePants? SpongeBob: Eh, I have an idea. [The scene changes to Patrick riding on Coupe at the Krusty Krab like a kiddie ride.] Patrick: These self-driving boats are real classy. [laughs until Coupe stops moving; Patrick grumbles and throws his ice cream on the hood] It stopped again. SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick. [gives him a bag of quarters] Here's a whole bag of quarters so you can ride forever. Patrick: Ohh! [puts a quarter through the slot and Coupe begins moving again] Coupe: Please, somebody, strip me, sell me for parts! Just put me out of my misery! [zoom out of the Krusty Krab, then the iris closes in on Coupe, ending the episode]"

  "synopsis": [
   "The episode starts off with a boating film named Safety At Sea: \"An Educational Boating Film.\" Mrs. Puff comes out and tells the audience that she will help student drivers learn the rules to earn their license.Lesson #1: \"The Five-Point Pre-Check.\" Squidward demonstrates checking his boat before driving: checking the tire buoyancy, ensures the propeller is oiled, confirms the horn works, tests his signals, and fastens his seatbelt. SpongeBob is used to demonstrate improper driving: he over-inflates his tires, dumps too much oil on the propeller and splashes it on Squidward, honks the horn too hard, and spins his signals fast enough that the boat takes flight. While putting his seatbelt on, he wraps it around the entire boat. Its tires pop and it falls onto Squidward's boat. SpongeBob asks if he can get his license now, and Mrs. Puff says no.Lesson #2: \"Entering Traffic.\" Squidward, still injured, inches forward and waits for traffic to clear up. When the roads are clear, he looks both ways and moves forward slightly. SpongeBob comes from the side and rams into him, sending Squidward's boat flying into a billboard. SpongeBob asks for his license again, and Mrs. Puff says no.Lesson #3: \"Spotting Pedestrians.\" Squidward watches out for pedestrians: he swerves around an old lady and a baby. When he is about to run into a fruit cart, he lifts his boat up to evade it. He then spots two workers carrying a pane of glass, but runs off two boards and a truck as a ramp to go over them. SpongeBob suddenly jumps into his way, bouncing on a pogo stick. Squidward almost runs into the old lady again, but she reveals her muscles and destroys his car, throwing it into a garbage truck. SpongeBob bounces into the camera, asking for his license.Due to a missing reel, the video skips ahead to Lesson #29: \"Navigation.\" Squidward, now heavily bandaged and with his boat damaged, first runs over some speed bumps. Next, he sees children crossing, but they are so slow that he drives around them. Overwhelmed by directions, Squidward checks his map and goes into the freeway -- only for Mrs. Puff to narrate that reading a map while driving is bad driving etiquette, to his embarrassment. SpongeBob shows up driving the wrong way, skidding against Squidward's boat and sending him out of control. Squidward's boat goes off an unfinished bridge and explodes.The reel skips ahead to Lesson #53: \"Proper Passenger Etiquette.\" An even more injured Squidward is driving with SpongeBob as his passenger. SpongeBob tells Squidward that he will earn his license, jumping on the dashboard and blocking his vision. Squidward pushes him away. When Mrs. Puff tells him not to be a \"backseat driver,\" he grabs hold of Squidward's brace and makes him drive out-of-control. Next, SpongeBob turns up the music too loud, then sets the AC too cold and too hot. He sets the car in reverse, almost crashing into the children until Squidward takes control again. Squidward shoves SpongeBob in the glove compartment.Lesson #54: \"Road Rage.\" Patrick passes Squidward, making him angry and leading him to speed up. Mrs. Puff narrates an acronym, \"RAGE: Relax And Go Elsewhere.\" SpongeBob comes out of the glove compartment and helps Squidward relax through deep breathing, drinking tea, and raking a small Zen garden. Just after Squidward is finally relaxed, it turns out that the car is completely stopped and there is a long line of traffic behind them. Squidward tries to start the car, but it sputters instead. A large trucker steps out and grabs Squidward. Before he can punch him, the film itself burns up and disintegrates.The episode switches format, with only the character's silhouettes being seen against the projector. SpongeBob tries to fix it, but gets caught in it himself. Mrs. Puff tells him to get out, and says that they cannot finish the film, walking off as the class cheers. SpongeBob still wants to finish class and get his license, so he tries to make the video himself.SpongeBob's \"film\" opens with a crudely-drawn prop of his driver's license. SpongeBob narrates that he was such a good driver that he got a ceremony in his honor. He then brings peace to the world by delivering Krabby Patties, catching criminals, and preventing the ice caps from melting. In the final shot, cutouts of Mrs. Puff and Squidward start kissing him.Mrs. Puff snaps and turns the lights on, revealing SpongeBob making the video himself using paper cut-outs in front of the projector screen. She dismisses the students, then throws SpongeBob's cut-outs into the fireplace. The students drive their desks out of class, but Mrs. Puff grabs SpongeBob and takes him back in. She confiscates his paper license, tears it up, then kicks him out of class and slams the door."

   "[The episode opens with the text \"PICTURE START\" written in white against a black screen, then inverting. An old-timey countdown plays. More text appears, reading \"Safety At Sea: 'An Educational Boating Film.'\" It flickers to a shot of the outside of Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Mrs. Puff comes out of the front door.] Mrs. Puff: Hello, student drivers! I'm Mrs. Penelope Puff, and, as per the court order, I will be your driving instructor in this educational film. By remembering these [takes out list] 138 simple rules of the road, [throws list away] every one of you will know all that you need to get your very own boating license. [Cut to SpongeBob having crashed a boat into a brick wall.] SpongeBob: [spaced out] Even me? Mrs. Puff: [shrugs, disappointed] Ugh. [Text appears saying \"#1 The Five Point Pre Check.\"] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] First lesson: the five point pre check [The text disappears to show Squidward standing next to a boat.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Here we have Mr. Good Driver. Before starting the vehicle, he always inspects five areas of his boat for safety. [Squidward nods.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] He checks his tire buoyancy... [Squidward kneels down to the boat's tires, points at a meter, and reads it.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Ensures his motor is properly oiled... [Squidward squeezes a small drop of oil onto the boat's motor, then flicks it.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Confirms his boat horn is functioning... [Squidward is inside the boat, and he honks his horn twice.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Reviews his signals... [Two flags come out of the boat and move in various directions.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] And most importantly, he fastens his seatbelt. [Squidward fastens his seatbelt and clasps his hands as a halo appears above him. The camera pans over to show SpongeBob standing at another boat.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] And here we have a bad driver, or, what I refer to as \"a SpongeBob.\" SpongeBob: Check tire pressure! [He inflates all the boat's tires to a large size.] Oil propeller: check! [He dumps a bucket of oil onto the propellor, which spins rapidly and splatters on Squidward, who grumbles.] Check horn: check! [He honks the horn very hard.] Horn: [screaming] Out of the way! [Squidward is blown back by the horn's noise, also spraying the oil off him.] SpongeBob: Check signals! Checkareeno! [SpongeBob twirls his signal flags so fast that the boat takes flight.] SpongeBob: Seatbelt! [stretches it and ties it around the entire boat] Belted! [The boat falls and the tires pop, sending it flipping backwards onto Squidward] Whoa! [comes out of the overturned boat and waves] Can I get my license now? [The word \"NO\" is stamped on the screen.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] No. [Text appears saying \"#2 Entering Traffic\"] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Now to our second lesson: entering traffic. [Cut to Squidward, who has a black eye and a bump on his head as stars circle around him.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] As he begins his journey, Mr. Good Driver makes sure to watch carefully for oncoming boats. [Squidward goes forward, and two lines of boats are in front of him. He looks to his sides, and the traffic clears up, leaving the road empty.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Only when the road is clear does he accelerate into traffic. [Squidward looks to his sides, and no boats are coming. He inches forward. Suddenly, SpongeBob drives in from the left and crashes into him.] SpongeBob: Beep beep! [Squidward's boat smashes into a billboard that says \"Yum! Dogs!\" with a fish eating a hot dog, with his boat covering the hot dog.] SpongeBob: [waving] Can I get my license now? [The word \"NO\" is stamped on the screen again.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] No! [Text appears saying \"#3 Spotting Pedestrians\"] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Lesson 3: spotting pedestrians. [Squidward is driving on the road, now with a bandaged head, a bandage on his nose, two black eyes, and a scratched boat.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] There are several types of pedestrians, so Mr. Good Driver always keeps careful watch. [Squidward puts on a safari hat and takes out binoculars, then starts looking around him. He sees an old lady doing acrobatics across the street.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Here we have the cunning little old lady. [Squidward screams in surprise, then drives around her. He looks ahead and sees a baby in a carraige.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Ah, and the babbling baby in a buggy. [The baby spits out its pacifier.] Baby: [angry gibberish] [Squidward swerves around the baby and continues driving. A starfish is seen with a cart of fruit.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] The common fruit vendor... [Squidward pulls his boat up, and it goes over the fruit cart. Two worker fish come out of the sewer holding a pane of glass. They notice Squidward and begin sidestepping to avoid him.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] And, naturally, we see some workmen carrying a large pane of glass. Squidward: How cliche! [He notices a truck with two wooden boards as ramps behind it. He drives off of it to go clear over the workers, who gasp and watch. Sunglasses fall onto Squidward's face.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Mr. Good Driver may think he can let his guard down, but there's still one pedestrian waiting to strike. [A trash can rumbles. SpongeBob's eyes peer out of it, and he jumps out onto the street with a pogo stick. He stops in front of Squidward, and the screen freezes with the caption \"Poriferous Aggravatus.\"] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] The rare Poriferous Aggravatus. Commonly known as \"a SpongeBob.\" SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! [Squidward screams and starts swerving, but SpongeBob keeps jumping in front of him.] SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! Hi, Squidward! Hi, Squidward! Hi, Squidward! [Squidward screams and notices the old lady from before. She flexes her muscles, and the boat crashes into her. She smashes it up and throws it into a garbage truck. SpongeBob gets off his pogo stick and jumps towards the screen.] SpongeBob: Hey! Can I get my license now? [Text appears saying \"REEL MISSING\". It switches to \"#29 Navigation\".] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Lesson 29: navigation. [Squidward now has a neck brace and bandaged arms, and his boat is in worse condition.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Mr. Good Driver must obey various road signs. Here are just a few. [a sign with a tire appears] Speed bumps... [Squidward drives over many speeds bumps in succession, sputtering as he does. A sign with three kids on it appears.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Slow children at play... [Squidward runs into three children crossing the street. They move in slow-motion. Squidward gets impatient waiting for them to pass and drives around them. As he keeps driving, he sees a massive amount of road signs.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Sometimes even Mr. Good Driver may be overwhelmed with directions. [Squidward panics and takes out a map as he heads onto the freeway.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Never read a road map while driving. That's something only a SpongeBob would do. [Squidward laughs nervously and packs up the map. SpongeBob is heading the opposite direction, reading an open map. Passengers scream and swerve around him.] SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! [Squidward screams and his boat collides with SpongeBob's. He is sent spinning out of control and slides off of an unfinished exit. His boat explodes, and the reel skips. Text displays \"#53 Proper Passenger Etiquette.\"] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Lesson 53: proper passenger etiquette. [Squidward now has his arm and head in a cast, with a blood drip hooked to his arm. His feet are bandaged. SpongeBob sits in the passenger seat.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Good driving also means being a good passenger. Never distract your driver. SpongeBob: Guess what, Squidward? I'm gonna get my license today! [slides onto the dashboard] Mrs. Puff said at the end of the film, I'm gonna get it! [Squidward can't see the road with SpongeBob blocking his view.] Squidward: Oh, you're gonna \"get it,\" alright! [shoves him into the backseat] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] It's also important not to be a backseat driver. SpongeBob: Ooh! I can drive from the backseat? [SpongeBob grabs Squidward's head brace and twists his neck, causing the boat to go out of control.] Squidward: That's it! You're driving me crazy! [The boat halts, and SpongeBob falls back into the passenger seat. Squidward starts driving again.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Finally, as a passenger, you must never play with the boat's control console. SpongeBob: Ah, let's get some tunes goin' here! [SpongeBob turns the radio on, and techno music plays, causing the boat to bump up and down and buildings' windows to break.] SpongeBob: How about some AC? [SpongeBob turns the AC to the left, causing a large blast of snow. He and Squidward look like snowmen.] SpongeBob: Brrr! Too cold! [He turns the AC to the right, causing a blast of flame that melts the snow. Squidward is burned, with three flames on his head brace.] SpongeBob: Ooh, let me help you with that! [As he goes to put out a flame, he grabs onto the gear stick and puts it into reverse. The boat speeds backwards. The children are still at play.] Children: [slow-motion] Oh no! [Squidward grabs the gear stick and puts the boat back into drive. SpongeBob giggles nervously, and Squidward growls and shoves him into the glove compartment.] [Text appears saying \"#54 Road Rage\"] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Lesson 54: road rage. [Squidward is driving angrily.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Even Mr. Good Driver may be tempted to take his anger out on a fellow motorist... [Patrick drives up and passes Squidward. Squidward gets angry, his head cast breaks off, his face goes red, and he slams on the gas pedal.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] In times like these, remember one simple word: RAGE. [the word appears as a caption] Relax And Go Elsewhere. [the rest of the text appears] SpongeBob: [in glove compartment] Oh, I know this one! [lets himself out, buckles his seatbelt, and rubs Squidward's head] Let me help you relax, friend. Just breathe in... and out. [Squidward does, and the redness from his face disappears.] SpongeBob: That's it. [takes out tea] Now how about a relaxing cup of kelp tea? [He pours the tea in Squidward's mouth. Squidward sighs and smiles.] SpongeBob: Refreshing, right? Squidward: Mmm-hmmm. SpongeBob: Now, let's rake some sand. [SpongeBob pours a bucket of sand on the dashboard. Squidward rakes a small spiral around a rock, then smile at each other.] SpongeBob: There. Relaxed... [Their boat is completely stopped. There is a long line of angry passengers behind it.] SpongeBob: Maybe it's time to go elsewhere? [Squidward tries to start the boat, but it sputters. A large trucker steps out of his truck and grabs Squidward, then winds up to punch him. Before he does, the film itself disintegrates, leaving nothing but a gray projector screen. Characters' shadows are seen as they talk.] Mrs. Puff: This darn projector! Just when we were getting to the good part! SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff! Let a good noodle handle that for ya! Mrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, that's okay! [SpongeBob walks up to the screen and tries to pull it open. He gets sucked in headfirst, and his entire body takes up the screen.] SpongeBob: Huh? Huh? [looks at screen] I'm ready for my close-up! [laughs] Mrs. Puff: Get out of there! SpongeBob: [nervously] Yes, ma'am! [SpongeBob detaches himself from the projector.] Mrs. Puff: Ugh! Well, I guess we can't finish the film... [walks off] [The students start cheering.] SpongeBob: B-b-but if we can't finish the film, we can't finish class! [The students cheer again.] SpongeBob: And if we can't finish class, then I can't get my license! [The students cheer again.] SpongeBob: I know! I'll finish the film myself! [The students boo.] [SpongeBob sticks his foot against the projector.] SpongeBob: [narrating] And now, the moment you've all been waiting for! [scatting] [SpongeBob holds up a poorly-made prop driver's license on a stick and waves it around.] SpongeBob: [narrating] SpongeBob's boating license! SpongeBob was such an exemplary driver... Mrs. Puff: [narrating, exasperated] Oh, please ... [The screen wraps up to show a City Hall backdrop. A cutout of SpongeBob sits on a throne.] SpongeBob: [narrating] That a special ceremony was held in his honor at City Hall! It was a dream come true! [A cutout of Mrs. Puff descends, holding a license.] SpongeBob: [narrating] Mrs. Puff had deemed him worthy of the road! [A poorly constructed model of SpongeBob holds up the license.] SpongeBob: [narrating] He finally had a dazzling, genuine, full-sized boating license! [A cutout of SpongeBob drives on top of a rotating image of Earth.] SpongeBob: [narrating] Now, imbued with the power of good driving, [the Earth flips to reveal a peace sign] SpongeBob brought peace to the people of this troubled world! [A cutout of SpongeBob drives up to a house, then throws a giant Krabby Patty at the person inside. The person's frown flips upside down and hearts appear.] SpongeBob: [narrating] He delivered Krabby Patties to the hungry! [Cutouts of a robber stealing a purse from an old lady are shown. SpongeBob's boat drives up, opens its front as a mouth, and a tongue grabs and eats the robber. The lady holds up her purse.] SpongeBob: [narrating] He de-escalated petty crime! [A cutout of SpongeBob pushes a frowning iceberg into another one, making them smile and hug.] SpongeBob: [narrating] And he even kept the ice caps from melting! [A cutout of SpongeBob stands in front of a heart backdrop.] SpongeBob: [narrating] Yes, everyone loved SpongeBob more than ever now that he had his boating license! They all loved him sooo much! Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah! [Cutouts of Mrs. Puff and Squidward start kissing SpongeBob. In the classroom, Mrs. Puff seethes in anger.] Mrs. Puff: [angry] That is quite enough! [She slams her fist into the light switch, causing the lights to come on and the switch to fall off. Cut to SpongeBob, surrounded by craft supplies, making the movie in front of the projector screen.] Mrs. Puff: We'll resume the correct lesson next week. Class is dismissed. [clasps hands] Just remember what you learned today... [grabs cutouts] And no more of this nonsense! [She wads up the cutouts and throws them into a fireplace.] Students: Yes, Mrs. Puff. [They rev up their desks like boats and drive out. SpongeBob is the last, and Mrs. Puff grabs him before he can leave the school. Mrs. Puff holds out her hand, and SpongeBob laughs nervously. He gives her his prop license, which she tears apart. Mrs. Puff kicks him out of the school.] SpongeBob: Beep beep! [Mrs. Puff glares at him and then slams the door shut, ending the episode.]"

  "synopsis": [
   "The episode starts with SpongeBob recklessly driving. He suddenly thinks of blowing bubbles to relax after getting stressed. It soon backfires when the distraction of said bubbles causes his boat to eventually crash. Mrs. Puff loses her temper and she harshly yells at SpongeBob that he is hopeless at getting a driver's license, and he walks off sad. He then sees Larry, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick have their own boats. He only gets sadder each time he sees his friends with a boat.He sits behind his house blowing bubbles. He wishes that he could be as good as driving boats as he is for blowing bubbles. Suddenly, he has the idea of blowing a bubble boat to drive in. Everyone is pleased with the new boat type. A policeman notices and says that every vehicle requires a license, but SpongeBob replies that no license is required for driving a bubble. The policeman then agrees. SpongeBob gets home to tell Gary all the good news on his new bubble boat experience, though Gary just ignores him.Soon, everyone is desperately wanting bubble boats, so SpongeBob gets a giant container of bubble mix into a tub. Afterward, SpongeBob makes a bubble boat for everyone.Meanwhile, Mrs. Puff notices everyone has a bubble boat. She is trying to drive home with her normal boat, but this angers many of the bubble boat drivers, as well as the police towing away her normal boat. Puff then has to go to Bubble Boating School, a temporary boating school run by SpongeBob.At Bubble Boating School, SpongeBob teaches Mrs. Puff about how to drive a bubble boat. She eventually understands how to ride a bubble boat, after going through mastering multiple dangerous obstacle courses. She then does her final test, being on the real road.During her final bubble-boating test, she is happily talking to SpongeBob about the bubble boats, but soon gets distracted and goes to the highway instead of continuing on the small roads. She ends up crashing, leading her to involuntarily expand, which makes her cause further mayhem to the bubble boaters. SpongeBob ends up saving all of them just in time.Soon, the police come to tell everyone, including SpongeBob, that bubble boats are now outlawed and normal boats have been re-legalized. SpongeBob then tells Mrs. Puff that he will see her again at boating school the next day. At the end of the episode, Mrs. Puff expands and sighs before she pops herself."

   "[The episode begins with SpongeBob once again trying to pass his boating test. SpongeBob is driving out of control.] Mrs. Puff: Look out! Oh! [SpongeBob hits the boat against the fence and the boat bounces back on the road. The boat swerves around in circles and a passing driver crash into the fence.] Driver 1: Learn how to drive! SpongeBob: I'm trying! Mrs. Puff: Calm down, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff! [SpongeBob comes up with an idea as a bottle of bubble soap appears above his head.] SpongeBob: Nothing soothes one's frazzled nerves like blowing bubbles! [blows lot of bubbles that covers the boat] Mrs. Puff: No blowing bubbles while driving! [SpongeBob's bubbles pops into the eyes of many drivers. SpongeBob's boat stops.] Mrs. Puff: Phew! [sighs] [The drivers appear out of the cloud of bubbles and crash into SpongeBob's boat, inflating Mrs. Puff in the process. SpongeBob laughs nervously as the drivers moan and groan in pain. Firefighters arrive to put out the fire.] Driver 2: I can't feel my big toe. SpongeBob: So, uh, how'd I do? Mrs. Puff: [deflates herself] Get out! You're never getting a boating license! SpongeBob: [whimpers as he goes to leave] But\u2014but\u2014 Mrs. Puff: [screams] Never! Never! [SpongeBob curls up and sulks away. A piece of debris falls on Mrs. Puff's head, inflating her again.] SpongeBob: I'll never pass my driver's test, I'll never get my license, and I'll never know the joys of boat ownership! [SpongeBob notices Larry's boat at his gym.] Nancy Suzy Fish: Ooh... Tina Fran: It's really nice. [The girls giggle.] Larry: Oh, yeah, it's a turbo jet. 390 sea horse power with 11-to-1 pop-up piston. [chest revs like a racecar engine] We're talking some serious muscle! [Larry turns on his boat and his engine roars.] Tina Fran: I love your boat, Larry! [hugs the tire] [SpongeBob murmurs as he sees Larry's boat. He sulks off as the girls continue to admire Larry and his boat. SpongeBob continues to sulk back to his house until he sees Mr. Krabs washing his boat.] Mr. Krabs: Oh, hey there, boyo! Lovely day for a boat wash! [wrings out his sponge] Isn't it? [SpongeBob runs away, crying.] Mr. Krabs: Whoa. Maybe I shouldn't have borrowed Pearl's shorts. [SpongeBob stops running and continues to cry. Then he notices Patrick.] SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, you want to hang out? Patrick: Wish I could, SpongeBob, but I'm kind of busy spending time with my boat right now. SpongeBob: Your boat. [shrinks] Sure, Patrick. See you later. [whimpers] [Patrick hums as he takes out a flying disc.] Patrick: Catch! [throws flying disc at the boat] [The scene changes to SpongeBob sulking behind his house. He blows a bubble version of Mrs. Puff.] Bubble Mrs. Puff: You're a very good driver, SpongeBob, and my favorite student. Here's your license. [The Bubble Mrs. Puff blows a bubble license and gives it to SpongeBob before she pops.] SpongeBob: Ooh! [bubble license pops] Aww! If only I was as good at driving as I am at blowing bubbles. [sulks down; gasps] Oh! That's it! [The scene changes to SpongeBob putting on some shades.] Abigail Marge: Whoa! Tom: What is that? [SpongeBob appears to be driving in a bubble-shaped boat. As he drives it, everyone seems to take notice of it. He stops at a stoplight.] Girls: Oh! SpongeBob: All right, all right. [SpongeBob bounces inside his bubble boat and makes it go faster. A boat in back of the girls' boat crashes at seeing SpongeBob's bubble boat. Just then, a motorcycle cop comes by.] SpongeBob: Pleasant day for a drive, hey, Officer? Motorcycle Cop: Sir, I'm going to need to see your license for that, um... SpongeBob: [laughs] You don't need a license to drive a bubble. Motorcycle Cop: Hmm, I suppose you're right. Carry on, citizen. [SpongeBob drives off with his bubble boat. The scene changes to SpongeBob coming home with his bubble boat. He enters his house and jumps in front of Gary, who is sleeping on his chair.] SpongeBob: Gary! Gary: [yowls] SpongeBob: You'll never believe it! I was out driving all day! Yes, driving! First, I drove down the street like this! [SpongeBob imitates his driving experience by floating around the house.] SpongeBob: Then I made a right turn on red like this. [SpongeBob imitates his right turn on red and floats around the living room. He lands on top of Gary.] SpongeBob: You should've been there, Gary! Oh, it was like a dream come true! Gary: [grumbling] Meow. [Gary goes back to sleep. SpongeBob hears a knock at the door.] SpongeBob: Hmm? [SpongeBob answers the door and sees various people.] Green Fish: I'm here for a bubble boat. Martin: Uh, yeah, me too! Dave: I want one! Various people: Uh, yeah, yeah, me too! Yes, please. One, please. SpongeBob: Oh, I'm not sure I have enough soap to make this many bubble boats. Green Fish: Please? SpongeBob: Well, I suppose I could tap into my rainy day reserves. [The scene changes to SpongeBob carrying a large bottle-full of bubble soap for everyone to have bubble boats. He pushes the bottle into the tub and fills it with soap. He kicks the bottle away. The green fish grunts in excitement. SpongeBob takes out his bubble wand from his mouth.] SpongeBob: One bubble boat coming right up! [SpongeBob dips his wand into the soap and blows the green fish a bubble boat.] Green Fish: Thank you! [The green fish drives off with his bubble boat.] Plankton: Down here, idiot! I want to strike fear in the hearts of other drivers. You got something terrifying in that wand for me, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: I sure do, Plankton! [SpongeBob dips his wand into the soap and blows Plankton a bubble boat that appears to be a killer robot. Plankton tries to get in, but he bounces off because the bubble is too big.] Plankton: Oof! [SpongeBob takes out a straw and sips the bubble boat down to Plankton's size. Plankton gets into his bubble boat.] Plankton: Ha-ha-ha, you fool! Now I will rule the streets! [cackles] [Plankton starts to drive his boat, but gets stepped on by Larry within seconds.] Plankton: Ouch! [SpongeBob looks on, disgusted, as Larry raises his foot, unsticking Plankton from his foot. Plankton, squished into a blob, crawls away.] Plankton: Strike fear... Larry: Hmm...blow me something that screams Larry, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: I'm on it, Larry! [SpongeBob pulls out a bigger wand, dips it in the soap, inhales and blows three huge bubbles until he shrivels. The three bubbles form into a bubble boat that has muscles like Larry.] Larry: Now, this is what I call a muscle car! [Larry jumps into his bubble boat as Tina drives by with her bubble boat.] Tina Fran: I love your boat, Larry! [Larry's bubble boat bulks up as they drive away. Just then, a huge line of people line up at SpongeBob's house.] SpongeBob: [sighs] I'll never blow enough bubble boats at this rate. Yahoo! [jumps into tub] [SpongeBob absorbs the bubble soap and blows a huge amount of bubble boats for everyone. The crowd cheers. Meanwhile at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, Mrs. Puff is preparing for class.] Mrs. Puff: [hums as she writes on the board] Greetings, class. My name is\u2014 [gasps] [No one is there.] Mrs. Puff: [startled stammer] Mrs. Puff. Oh, now that everyone's driving bubbles, they don't need licenses. [sighs] I guess there's just no place in this world for an old driving instructor. [Mrs. Puff puts her apple in her apples box. She drives away from her Boating School and drives into the street.] Mrs. Puff: Oh! Bah! Fred: Hey, watch it, lady! [Mrs. Puff swerves into a passing driver.] Mrs. Puff: Ah! Tom: I'm driving over here! [Mrs. Puff swerves into another passing driver.] Mable: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Mrs. Puff: Oh\u2014wah! [Mrs. Puff swerves into another passing driver.] Clay: Hey! Pick a lane, butter-brain! [A stoplight turns red as Mrs. Puff frantically tries to drive. As she drives, she runs through a stoplight, popping many bubble boats in the process. Just then, a motorcycle cop comes by on a bubble motorcycle.] Motorcycle Cop: I'm going to have to ask you to step out of the boat, ma'am. Do you know why I pulled you over? Mrs. Puff: You ran my plates and saw my rap sheet? Motorcycle Cop: What? No. Your vehicle has been outlawed, ma'am. [A truck driver tolls Mrs. Puff's boat with his bubble truck, throwing out her apples in the process.] Motorcycle Cop: Now that everyone drives bubble boats, real boats have been deemed too sharp and pointy to be street legal. [writes a ticket] Mrs. Puff: But I've never driven a bubble! [The motorcycle cop gives Mrs. Puff a ticket and leaves.] Mrs. Puff: Bubble boating school? [The scene changes to Mrs. Puff's Boating School now changed to Bubble Boating School. Mrs. Puff walks to the school, worried.] Mrs. Puff: Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. [opens door] Please don't be SpongeBob. [SpongeBob is seen at the desk.] SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [spins on the chair until he flies into the board] Hi, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: Of course. SpongeBob: You must be here for the bubble lessons. Don't worry, Mrs. P. [blows bubble] You'll be learning from a master. [SpongeBob bounces his bubble around. He puts his foot on it and pops it, making him fall over.] SpongeBob: Whoa! [belches out bubble and laughs] Mrs. Puff: Great. [The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff at the driving track in the bubble boat.] SpongeBob: Now, to get your bubble going, just pump your legs like this. [SpongeBob pumps his legs and makes the bubble boat move. He gives the steering wheel to Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff tries to do what SpongeBob did, but she loses her balance.] Mrs. Puff: Oh! Ooh! Oh! [Mrs. Puff inflates herself inside the bubble boat.] SpongeBob: Nice start. [The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff at the starting line again. Mrs. Puff pumps her legs and manages to control the bubble boat. She makes a left turn from the wall and turns where the safety cones are. SpongeBob is writing down her scores. Mrs. Puff avoids prickly cactuses. However, she did not notice the cactuses that are on fire.] Mrs. Puff: Oh! Fire! [Mrs. Puff makes the bubble boat run through the burning cactuses and swerves it into the school's lighthouse. The lighthouse is set on fire and firemen arrive in their bubble firetruck to put out the fire. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff at the starting line again. Mrs. Puff takes a deep breath and drives the bubble boat again. She goes over a hill, through a loop-de-loop hill, and drives past the flaming cactuses.] Mrs. Puff: Oh! Ah! Hmm. Hah. Eeh. [Mrs. Puff stops the bubble boat at the starting line.] Mrs. Puff: I did it. SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, you're ready. Mrs. Puff: Really? SpongeBob: Absolutely! You just need to pass your final test...out there. [points to people driving in their bubble boats] Mrs. Puff: [whimpering] Oh. [Mrs. Puff drives the bubble boat out of the boating school.] SpongeBob: Nice and easy. Doing great. [Mrs. Puff continues driving.] Harold: Hello! [Mrs. Puff waves to Harold.] Mrs. Puff: You know, this whole bubble boating thing isn't so bad. [laughs] Maybe I could\u2014 SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mrs. Puff! You got on the freeway by mistake! Look out! [Mrs. Puff frantically panics now that she is on the freeway.] SpongeBob: It's okay! Just calm down! [Mrs. Puff swerves the bubble boat to the left.] Mrs. Puff: Eeh! Oh! [A passing driver makes Mrs. Puff's bubble boat spin around. The bubble boat hits two other drivers and bounces off into another street. Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob are driving in a one-way street and almost get hit by other drivers.] Mrs. Puff: Ah! [SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff move around in the bubble boat in panic.] Mrs. Puff: Oh! [Mrs. Puff's bubble boat hits Nathiel Waters' bubble boat.] Mrs. Puff: Oh! [inflates herself and pops her bubble boat] [SpongeBob was sent flying into the ground. He pulls his head out of the sand.] SpongeBob: Ah! [Mrs. Puff's inflated body causes a pileup in the middle of the road. The bubble boats send Mrs. Puff and the other drivers flying to the surface.] SpongeBob: Oh no. What's gonna happen when they hit the surface? [The bubble boats reach the surface and they pop, sending everyone falling downward. SpongeBob quickly takes out his bubble soap and blows a lot of bubbles. SpongeBob's bubbles catches and saves everyone.] SpongeBob: Doh! [SpongeBob blows one last bubble to save Mrs. Puff.] Mrs. Puff: [wipes the soap off] No more bubbles. Get them off me! SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. Even though it was bubbles that caused all these problems, it was also bubbles that solved 'em. That's kind of a wash, I guess. Get it? Wash? Soap? Bubbles? [laughs] Motorcycle Cop: [takes bubble wand] Give me that! Bubble boats are too unstable. They've been declared illegal. Everyone back to your regular boats! [breaks the bubble wand and leaves] SpongeBob: Well, Mrs. Puff, looks like I have to get my boating license after all. See you tomorrow in class! \u266aLa-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la\u266a Mrs. Puff: [inflates herself] Oh, joy. [pops]"

  "synopsis": [
   "The episode begins with SpongeBob thinking everyone is welcoming him to Mrs. Puff's Boating School, but it turns out the son of Tony Fast has enrolled in the school. All of the students were crowding around asking for his autograph. Mrs. Puff tells them that he shall receive no special attention. Right after that, she asked him for his autograph. Tony Fast Jr. is shown to be excellent at driving, which gives Mrs. Puff the idea to have him teach SpongeBob how to drive. During the test, Tony Fast Jr. explains to SpongeBob that he should relax, and this advice allows SpongeBob to drive better. He softens his foot on the gas pedal and goes around a corner. He successfully finishes the course and Mrs. Puff is relieved that she may not have to deal with him for much longer.Tony Jr. is walking on the boardwalk when SpongeBob comes up to him because he is eager to learn more from him. Tony states that he won't be able to teach him at the Boating School, but invites him to his home so he can learn. SpongeBob is at the gates of the Fast family's house and presses the button on the speaker. He is let in and Tony is on a unicycle. Both of his parents aren't home so Tony offers to show him his father's vintage speedboat collection. SpongeBob is amazed by all of the shiny speedboats and Tony asks him to pick his favorite. He chooses a flaming red speedboat and Tony asks if he wants to go for a ride in it.SpongeBob is driving the boat as Tony is on a hang glider that is attached to the boat. SpongeBob is nervous about driving and Tony tries to keep him calm so he doesn't crash again. He almost runs over a fish as his nerves start kicking in. He lets go of the steering wheel as Tony tells him to go faster. He lets go of the brakes and they go even faster. SpongeBob spots a red light and immediately stops the boat. Three fish are in a speedboat right next to them as they challenge them to a race. SpongeBob checks his schedule for any conflicts, and then accepts the challenge. However, after considering safety concerns he decides to decline the challenge. Tony Jr. is frustrated and calls it an embarrassment if they don't accept the challenge. Both race teams get ready as the traffic light changes to green. They take off throughout the town and SpongeBob starts gaining the lead. He presses harder on the gas pedal to get past his opponent again and the boat catches in flames as they pass Larry the Lobster. Larry catches the flames and gets an instant tan. Their opponents quickly slow down when they notice police nearby. SpongeBob is still going fast as they pass the police and they start after them.SpongeBob is freaking out and is unsure what to do as the sirens make it so Tony Jr. can't hear him. A police helicopter starts following them as well. Tony Fast Sr. is in his speedboat listening to the radio as a news story about the car chase comes on. The chase goes right by him and he starts chasing after SpongeBob and Tony Jr. He is angry as SpongeBob and Tony Jr. are clueless as to what they should do. Tony Jr. tries to calm SpongeBob once again and he declines his advice this time due to where it has gotten them. He drives through the sign of the Boating school and runs into Mrs. Puff as she inflates. Back in the classroom, Mrs. Puff is in a wheelchair and informs the class that Tony Jr. is no longer with them, and was transferred to another school. She also says that SpongeBob should never be let to drive, as the episode ends."

   "[the episode begins with SpongeBob coming into Mrs. Puff's Boating School] SpongeBob: [singing and running] \u266aGoing on down to Boating School! Boating School! Boating School! Going on down to Boating School! Rea-de-de-la Mrs. Puff!\u266a [stops and notices a crowd cheering] For me? Well on behalf on yours truly, I would like to thank each of you for such a wonderful and warm welcome. [walks over and shakes a female fish's fin] Thank you. [walks over to Sandals and shakes his fin] Thank you, sir. Sandals: What'd I do? SpongeBob: [bumps into Mrs. Puff] Mrs. Puff, thank you most of all! [about to kiss Mrs. Puff's fin, but she pulls it away] Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, that warm welcome wasn't for you. SpongeBob: It wasn't? Mrs. Puff: No! SpongeBob: Well then, who was it for? Shubie: It's for him! [The crowd cheers as a green raceboat with the number 1 pulls up in front of the Driving School. A pit crew quickly changes its tires and smokes from the engines fog up then clear up revealing a fish with sunglasses, a hat, and a mustache] SpongeBob: [gasps] It's Tony Fast! The famous race boat driver! [camera points down to a smaller fish beside Tony Fast] And his first born son, Tony Fast Jr.! Mable-Monica: I can't believe it's him! Oh... [falls onto a random fish's arms] SpongeBob: I can't believe that I'm in the presence of such big celebrities. Tony Fast: [pats Tony Jr.'s shoulder] Good luck on your first day of school son! Tony Jr.: Yeah, whatever. Tony Fast: Don't show off too much! [chuckles] Show off and just enough! [Tony Fast drives away on his raceboat causing smoke to fill the air to which the crowd coughs but then cheers and gathers around Tony Jr.] Harold: Hey! Tony Jr., [takes out a lunch box] wanna sign my lunch box? Sandles: [takes out a steering wheel] You wanna sign my steering wheel? Shubie: Wanna sign my... Harold: Hey! I was here first! Shubie: No, you weren't! I was! Mrs. Puff: [blows on whistle panting and sweating and taking a deep breath, then coughs] Ahem! While Tony Jr. is a student here, he will receive no special attention! He will be treated just like the rest of us! No exceptions! Now, Tony, report to the obstacle course where I will access your abilities! Tony Jr.: Sure thing, Teach! [walks over] Mrs. Puff: Hold it! [takes out a lunch box] Not until you've signed my lunchbox! [laughs] Crowd: [cuts to next scene] Go, Tony Jr., Go! Go, Tony Jr., Go! [Tony Jr. drives by them] Yay! Tony Jr.: [driving] Looks like it's my turn! [turns though a zig-zag like road] What goes around comes around! [drives around a giant anchor] Over and out! [drives up a hill-like road then back down and to the finish] Crowd: Hooray! Mrs. Puff: [thinking] He is good... Gasp! If he's really that good, maybe there's a chance, just a chance, some of that good could rub off my incorrigible student, SpongeBob SquarePants! [chuckles and out of thoughts] Yes! SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: Yes, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: What does \"incorrigible\" mean? [cuts to Tony Jr. in the boat with SpongeBob] Tony Jr.: So, you just want me to ride around with this dude for awhile? Mrs. Puff: That's it. Tony Jr.: Whatever... Let's roll! SpongeBob: It's nice to finally meet you Tony Fast Jr! [pants happily] Tony Jr.: I said let's roll! SpongeBob: [sweating frantically] Okay! Uh, roll? Roll!? Roll!? Is there a button for that? [starts pushing random button on the front of the boat] I know I know this! It's around here somewhere! I- Tony Jr.: Just drive! SpongeBob: Just driving! [slams down on the gas pedal driving quickly in which both SpongeBob and Tony Jr. scream as SpongeBob tries to drive the boat] W-w-w-what do these dotted lines mean? Tony Jr.: Relax, man. You gotta relax. SpongeBob: Relax... relax? Mrs. Puff hasn't taught us that yet! Tony Jr.: No, I mean just relax man... SpongeBob: Okay... just relaxing... and... relaxing! Relaxing! So hard! [his eye lids shatter] Raw! I can't relax! Tony Jr.: No, no, no. Not like that. You just gotta let go. SpongeBob: Let go? Tony Jr.: Be... cool... SpongeBob: Be cool? Tony Jr.: Be... cool... SpongeBob: Be... cool... [softly has his foot on the gas pedal as he drives perfectly around the corner and around the anchor] Cool... [drives up and down the road hill and finishes the course] Tony Jr.: Not bad, dude, not bad. Suzy: Gasp! It's a miracle! Harold: [on his knees] Neptune be praised! Mrs. Puff: That went better than expected! Oh! If Tony Jr. can keep this up, then SpongeBob might even graduate and I'll be rid of him forever! Forever! [laughs] Forever! Tony Jr.: Okay Bro-Jangles! Catch you... [jumps and flips off of the boat landing perfectly on the ground] ...on the flipside! [snaps and then gets picked up by Mrs. Puff] What the? [Mrs. Puff kisses him on the cheek] [Cuts back to Tony Jr. walking on the boardwalk] Tony Jr.: [stops walking and notices SpongeBob] Yeah, what is it? Can't you see I'm walking here? SpongeBob: I can see that! And I'm eager to learn more from you! Tony Jr.: Eager? SpongeBob: Yeah! Tony Jr.: I can't teach you anything more at this square school, no offense, SquarePants. SpongeBob: None taken! Tony Jr.: Well, if you really wanna learn more, you can come by my house later! [walks off] SpongeBob: Oh! I'll be delighted to! [Cuts to SpongeBob outside of the gates of Tony Fast and Tony Jr.'s house] SpongeBob: [presses the button on the speaker] Tony Jr.: Who is it? SpongeBob: It's SpongeBob SquarePants! Tony Jr.: Who? SpongeBob: SpongeBob, SquarePants! [the gates open and Tony Jr. appears on a unicycle] Tony Fast Jr.! Tony Jr.: Guy from school! Come on in! SpongeBob: [inside the house] Nice place you got here, Tony Jr.! Tony Jr.: Thanks! Lived here all my life! My mom and dad are out. SpongeBob: Oh! Uh, what does that mean? Tony Jr.: It means... you wanna see my dad's vintage speedboat collection? SpongeBob: Oh, would I? [cuts to Tony Fast's gararge showing many speedboats] Tony Jr.: And he took first place in this beauty surpassing speed records held by both Francis Baconskin Jr. and Smitty Tailpipe Rockama! SpongeBob: Wow! They're so shiny! Tony Jr.: Pick your favorite! SpongeBob: My favorite? Oh, I couldn't! Tony Jr.: Why, sure you can! What's the big- SpongeBob: [points to a red speedboat with flames on the front and with the number 8 on it] This one! Tony Jr.: Huh? The Batonia Classic! Excellent choice! [grabs the keys to the Batonia Classic] Want to take her for a spin? SpongeBob: A spin? But we don't even have boating licenses! Tony Jr.: [in the speedboat] You don't need a boating license for a raceboat, SquarePants! [Bubble transition to SpongeBob driving the Batonia Classic] SpongeBob: Wow, Tony Jr.! She handles like a dream! It's like I'm floating air! Tony Jr.: [on a hanglider flying as a rope is keeping him tied to the speedboat] You're telling me! SpongeBob: Are you sure you're comfortable with me driving, though? I admit I'm feeling a little nervous... Tony Jr.: I wouldn't if I were you! Remember, it was your nerves that made us almost crash before! SpongeBob: Hah... my nerves! I almost forgot about... my nerves! [starts driving nervously almost running over a fish] Sorry sir! Tony Jr.: Just let go! [lets go of the hanglider but grabs back onto it] Phew... SpongeBob: Let go... got it! [lets go of the steering wheel and drives around a curve] Whee! Tony Jr.: Go faster, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Faster? Tony Jr.: Just let go! Of the brakes! SpongeBob: Eh... if you say so! [sticks up  his foot higher letting go of the brake and going even faster around more curves] Whee! [goes down the street] Whee! [goes over a loop] Whee! Tony Jr.: Now you're getting it! SpongeBob: Whee... red light! [notices the light turning red] Tony Jr.: Ah! SpongeBob: [instantly stops the boat] Tony Jr.: Real cool, SquarePants... [now beside SpongeBob in the boat] SpongeBob: Thanks, TFJ... [notices three fish in another speedboat beside them] Street Racer: That's quite a fancy speed boat you got right there! For a couple of squares! Female Passenger: What he said! [all three laugh] SpongeBob: Thank you! And may I say how lovely your speed boat is, too! For a bunch of circles! And by circles, I mean well-rounded individuals! [laughs] Street Racer: Well, wise guy, eh? Well then, how about you wise up to an unfriendly competition? Right here, right now! Female Passenger: Yeah! What he said! SpongeBob: Right here, right now? A little short notice... [takes out a small book] let me check my availability. [looks in the book] Let's see... right now... looks like I don't have anything scheduled for right now. Therefore, I would like to accept your challenge! Tony Jr.: Yes! SpongeBob: However! Certain safety concerns prevent me from doing so! Therefore, I must decline! Tony Jr.: SquarePants! I can't believe what I'm hearing here! SpongeBob: [tries to listen for something] I don't hear anything. Tony Jr.: [face-palm] Ah... look kid! Being cool includes accepting this challenge! Anything less would be an embarrassment! SpongeBob: I would never want to embarrass you, Tony Jr. Therefore, I accept your challenge! Street Racer: Oh, it's on! Female Passenger: What he said! Street Racer: Do you mind? [Both racers get ready as the red light changes to green and they both take off through the town. They pass fish in which they rip their clothes off and onto another. SpongeBob starts to get the lead.] Street Racer: Huh? [speeds up passed SpongeBob and Tony Jr.] Hah hah! Female Passenger: What he said! SpongeBob: Grr... Grr! [presses down harder on the gas pedal which starts to catch in flames as he speeds passed Larry the Lobster burning him] Larry: Sweet! Instant tannage! [SpongeBob catches up to the male race driver as they continue to drive beside each other] SpongeBob: [growls] Grr! Street Racer: [laughs until the female passenger points out to him, his eyes go through his glasses as there is a sign saying \"Click It or Ticket\" with police near by, then goes quick and slows down] SpongeBob: We're winning! We're winning! [SpongeBob and Tony Jr. laugh as they speed passed the police car] Policeman 1: Whoa! Did you see that? Policeman 2: That guy wasn't just going fast... Both: ...He was going Tony Fast! SpongeBob: [notices the police car] Huh? Oh, no! The cops are after us! What are we going to do? Tony Jr.: What? Sorry, I couldn't hear you over that siren. [A police helicopter now follows them] SpongeBob: Now there's a helicopter after us! Tony Jr.: What's that? I couldn't hear you over that helicopter! [Tony Fast is in his speedboat listening to the news on his radio] Newsman: And in other news, son of racing legend, Tony Fast is currently involved in a high speed chase, it is rumored that the... [SpongeBob and Tony Jr. drive passed Tony Fast with the police car and police helicopter still following them] Tony Fast: What the? SpongeBob: What're we going to do!? [notices Tony Fast in the mirror chasing them] Tony Fast: Tony Jr! When I get my hands on you, I'm gonna- SpongeBob: Now your dad is after us! Tony Jr.: Sorry, I couldn't hear you, my... my... my dad is after us?! What are we gonna do?! SpongeBob: How should I know? He's your dad! Tony Jr.: Well, just remember my advice, okay? All you got to do is let go... be cool... [the camera closely focus on SpongeBob's eyes] Let go... be cool... SpongeBob: [annoyed] Do you see where letting go has gotten us so far?! Huh?! Tony Jr?! [pants heavily] Tony Jr.: No, but I see where it's getting us next! SpongeBob: [notices quickly, screams, then drives through the sign of Mrs. Puff's Boating School and ends up on Mrs. Puff as she inflates] [Cuts to the inside of the classroom] Mrs. Puff: Well, class, I regret to inform you that Tony Jr. is no longer with us. Crowd: Gasp! Mrs. Puff: He was transferred to another school. However, I think maybe Tony Jr. taught us all a valuable lesson... SpongeBob: [on a hospital bed] Oh! Oh! Oh! Never argue and drive? Mrs. Puff: Close... the lesson is: [zoom out to reveal her injuries] Never let you drive!"

  "synopsis": [
   "The episode begins with a normal day at the Krusty Krab. The customers, however, are praising the Krabby Patties, which makes Mr. Krabs think they paid extra, but they did not. Mr. Krabs finds tears in a patty, patties without buns, and patties with only buns and no meat inside. Mr. Krabs asks why to Squidward, with him saying that SpongeBob failed his boating exam and that is why he is crying. Mr. Krabs goes to the kitchen to check. SpongeBob tells him everything that happened, so Mr. Krabs offers to give him lessons for more money and shorter time. He mentions teaching Pearl how to drive to make SpongeBob feel more comfortable.During the first attempt, they get in a boat outside the Krusty Krab, but SpongeBob reverses instead of going forward, causing them to crash. Mr. Krabs says it is a simple mistake.During the second attempt, Mr. Krabs takes SpongeBob to a massive parking lot to practice on, but SpongeBob reverses once again and crashes into the doors of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to drive forward slowly, but he ends up pulling the whole Krusty Krab wall off. Mr. Krabs checks the damage and totals up the cost in an upset manner. Mr. Krabs thinks for a moment and then gets an idea.During the third attempt, Mr. Krabs thinks that if SpongeBob is by his house, he will be more comfortable. His vocabulary puts him to sleep, only for SpongeBob to be woken up. SpongeBob cannot even drive to Patrick's house without crashing into the rock. Mr. Krabs then ends up flying into the Krusty Krab.During the fourth attempt, Mr. Krabs says he will give a signal, but as soon as he tells SpongeBob to put the boat into gear, he crashes into the Krusty Krab yet again.During the fifth attempt, Mr. Krabs is already exhausted, but before they start, SpongeBob gives Mr. Krabs an idea. In order to get the hang of it, they practice on a simulator arcade machine. SpongeBob thinks he has mastered it, but yet again, he manages to somehow destroy the Krusty Krab.During the sixth attempt, SpongeBob manages to crash into the Krusty Krab sign, knocking it over.During the seventh attempt, it starts off smoothly, but SpongeBob slides up a metal ramp and ends up hitting the backside of the sign. The sign bounces them back into the roof, destroying the Krusty Krab yet again.During the eighth attempt, they manage to go through the roof and out through the doors of the Krusty Krab. Then they appear out of nowhere, destroying the Krusty Krab yet again.During the ninth attempt, they crash into a sign. As they keep on driving, many Bikini Bottomites are swerving in and out so they can avoid SpongeBob's reckless driving. They spin out of control, almost about to crash into the Krusty Krab but strangely, they do not. However, the Bikini Bottomites do, causing the Krusty Krab to be once again destroyed completely.The scene transitions to Mr. Krabs looking very unhappy. He is holding the bill as SpongeBob crashes into the Krusty Krab for the tenth time. The repairman enters again to raise up the price on the bill.The scene transitions again as SpongeBob apologizes. Mr. Krabs says he is doing it all wrong and thinks that SpongeBob does better when there is a lot of damage potential, so he takes SpongeBob to the most dangerous road in Bikini Bottom: the Double Roundabout. SpongeBob is so nervous that he does not want to do it. Mr. Krabs literally proves that even Gary could do it by letting him drive a boat through the roundabout. A few seconds pass and he makes it with flying colors. Now it is SpongeBob's turn. He is just about to take the wheel when the police show up. Apparently, it is against the law to let a snail, or any other animal drive a boat, especially in dangerous places. But Mr. Krabs only makes it worse after he claims he taught Pearl to drive without permission or a license.Mr. Krabs thinks he is getting a ticket, but then realizes he is sentenced to be taught at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, as the episode ends."

   "[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab.] Mr. Krabs: [to Incidental 41] And how is everything for you today, sir? Incidental 41: [eating a different type of a Krabby Patty] Oh, it's great! Just great! Mr. Krabs: Fine, fine. Incidental 41: I just love this Krabby Patty! Mr. Krabs: Yeah, okay, always nice to hear. [starts walking away] Incidental 41: My Krabby Patty is a Krabby Patty and both buns are also Krabby Patties! [Krabs suddenly stops walking, eyes widen] So luxurious! Mr. Krabs: [runs back, takes the patty from Incidental 41, and looks at it as his pupil turn into dollar signs] You must've paid five times the price of a regular patty for that! Incidental 41: [off-screen] No extra. [on-screen] It's the same low price as a regular Krabby Patty. Mr. Krabs: [pupil dollar signs rip] Argh! [faints. Squidward sprinkles salt on him and he screams] Me eyes! What are you doing, Mr. Squidward?! [Squidward sprinkles more salt on him and he screams again] Squidward: I couldn't find a smelling salt, so I just used table salt. Fred: Hey, my Krabby Patty is just a bun! And the two buns... are also buns. Stale buns. Incidental 6: [teary-eyed] My patty tastes like sadness. Mr. Krabs: All right, that's enough. Patties with emotional flavors... [gets up, grunting] ...it's two bits extra. Now pay at the register. What in Davy Jones' locker is going on in here, Mr. Squidward?! Squidward: What do you think? SpongeBob's in one of his moods. He failed his boating exam...again. Mr. Krabs: Well, we can't have that. He's me best employee. Well, no offense. Squidward: None taken. Mr. Krabs: Melancholy and self-doubt are bad for business. Make a note of it. [walks to the kitchen] Squidward: Let me grab a pencil. [to himself] Ha, it's funny, cause I mean the opposite. Ha. [there are patties, covered in condiments, smushed in the window. SpongeBob is sobbing, lying on the floor] Mr. Krabs: [enters] Avast there, lad! [steps on SpongeBob's foot, causing him to stand up] You're wasting your valuable tears, salting me patties with grief. SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. [sniffles] Oh, I can't even cry right! [sobs] Mr. Krabs: There, there. Failing your driver's test is nothing to cry over. SpongeBob: Oh, I've been in driving school as long as I can remember, and I still don't have my license! Mr. Krabs: How much do they charge you at this driving school of yours? SpongeBob: [stops crying] Oh, about $100 a semester. Mr. Krabs: $100 a semester?! [pupils again turn into dollar signs] Well, I can do it for double the price and half the time! SpongeBob: [happily] Really? Mr. Krabs: Sure, I taught me own daughter Pearl how to drive like a little angel. [Pearl drives through the kitchen, moving the grill and the vat of grease from its spot, all while putting on makeup] Pearl: Hi, Daddy! I need money for shoes. Mr. Krabs: Sure, anything for me little angel Pearl. [gives Pearl money from his wallet] Pearl: Thanks, Daddy! [drives out of the kitchen, leaving a hole in the other wall] [Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs in a driving boat.] SpongeBob: Uh, are you sure about this, Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Why, I couldn't be sure, lad. You don't need a... [air quotes] \"professional\" to teach you how to drive. SpongeBob: You know, Mr. Krabs, at boating school, Mrs. Puff... Mr. Krabs: Wipe that boating school malarkey out of your mind, son! It's all a racket. SpongeBob: [gasps in shock] It is? Mr. Krabs: [points to SpongeBob] And that goes for every kind of schooling. Why, there ain't nothing truly important, you can't learn on the streets with half a jigger of common sense and your own two claws. Now, put 'er in gear! SpongeBob: [gives a thumbs-up] Okay! [starts the boat, but then accidentally reverses it, destroying the Krusty Krab sign] Mr. Krabs: [nervously chuckles] Well, rookie mistake, boy. It happens all the time. SpongeBob: It does? Mr. Krabs: No, but you got the right fire in your belly. SpongeBob: I do? Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Yeah. Well, you know, what we need is a change of venue. [Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs driving the boat in an empty parking lot.] Mr. Krabs: This empty parking lot is just the ticket. [parks the boat] Like every young person, the novice boater needs plenty of open, obstacle-free space and the freedom to make mistakes. [switches places with SpongeBob, making him the driver and Mr. Krabs the passenger] SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you're so wise. Mr. Krabs: [chuckles before putting his seatbelt on] Can't disagree with you there. All right, put 'er in gear! [SpongeBob again quickly reverses the boat, destroying the Krusty Krab entrance] Hmm. SpongeBob: Rookie mistake, right? Mr. Krabs: I suppose so. Now slowly inch forward and we'll check out the damage. SpongeBob: Inch, inch. Inch, inch, inch. Inch, inch. [does so, but doesn't notice an anchor in the back, destroying the whole front of the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs: [checks his mirrors] Oh, broken wall. That's about $15,000. Oh, kitchen fire. Oh, that'll be about 6 grand. [sees Squidward hitting a customer, Incidental 40, with a spatula] Ooh, lawsuit? Oh, that's a lot of zeroes! Ugh. [his eyes deflate, but they quickly return back to normal] [thinking in his head] All right, Krabs. Get a hold of yourself. You've been in worse fixes than this. Why, you've stared down the cannon's mouth, haven't ya? Look at that face. [sees SpongeBob's smile] Bleah! Is this the face of your final defeat? Is it, Krabs? [sees SpongeBob's smile more creepy, while also heavily breathing] [Bubble transition to the boat parked on SpongeBob's house driveway.] Mr. Krabs: Now, here's a place you should be comfortable with. SpongeBob: Oh, I'll say. Mr. Krabs: Just take a look around, boy-o: home sweet home. Nothing to make you twitchy and jumpy. Oh, just the opposite, in fact. A place so soothing and sweet, like a mother's gentle lullaby on a soft summer's night. [sees SpongeBob asleep with covers and Beary the teddy bear before waking him up with the horn] Oh, brother. Let's start with something simple: a little trip down the street to Patrick's house. [starts buckling his seatbelt, until...] SpongeBob: Patrick's house! [crashes into Patrick's rock, flipping Mr. Krabs off the boat and makes a crash landing into the Krusty Krab] Harv: [steps over Mr. Krabs] I'll have one Krabby Patty, please. Squidward: Okay. Mr. Krabs: [to Squidward] Upsell! Squidward: [sighs] [to Harv] Would you like fries with that? Harv: Yeah, sounds good. Mr. Krabs: [to Squidward] Better. [Bubble transition to the boat parked on SpongeBob's driveway.] Mr. Krabs: Okay, that was just fine, but next time, wait until I say, \"Put 'er into gear.\" [opens the passenger door, but after he said \"put 'er into gear,\" SpongeBob drives the car away from Mr. Krabs, causing the passenger door to come off the boat. SpongeBob then crashes into the Krusty Krab again. The boat is on top of a destroyed table] Squidward: You missed one. [the engine of the boat falls off it and destroys a before unbroken table] [Bubble transition again to the boat parked on SpongeBob's driveway.] Mr. Krabs: [sighs] A simple trip to Patrick's house: a line so straight and true. SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, let's just leave the boat here and walk. Mr. Krabs: Well, we, you know, we could do that. But you can't learn to drive without a boat. [gets an idea] Or can ye? [Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob at the arcade.] Mr. Krabs: You'll certainly learn the way of the boat with this here top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art technological simulator. [shot shows SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs standing in front of a driving arcade game] Mr. Krabs: Now hand me one of them tokens. [SpongeBob takes out a token. Mr. Krabs inserts it in the coin slot. The game turns on. SpongeBob sits in the seat] You'll need your protective headgear. [Mr. Krabs puts a helmet with goggles on SpongeBob] Computer on Screen: Ready? Drive! [the screen shows pixelated SpongeBob driving a boat to the Krusty Krab] SpongeBob: I'm doing it, Mr. Krabs! I'm driving the boat! [the screen shows The Krusty Krab approaching SpongeBob] Uh-oh. [brakes and a crash are heard. SpongeBob puts up his googles and sees that the arcade game has crashed into the top of the real-life Krusty Krab] Computer on Screen: Sixth place! [the arcade game falls in the Krusty Krab] [Bubble transition to the boat parked on the road again. A worker goes down a ladder while fixing the broken Krusty Krab, when SpongeBob drives into the Krusty Krab sign, breaking it. The worker climbs back up the ladder. Bubble transition to SpongeBob driving the boat yet again.] SpongeBob: Hey, look, Mr. Krabs. I'm driving! Mr. Krabs: Great job, boy. [gasps as the boat goes up a ramp and crashes into the Krusty Krab sign, which flips the boat into the Krusty Krab, destroying it yet again] [Bubble transition to the boat now going through a pipe on the roof of the Krusty Krab, then smashing its doors, while the worker hammers the roof.] Worker: Phew. [the boat crashes on the worker] [Bubble transition to the boat breaking a \"One Way\" sign as Mr. Krabs gasps, then screams with SpongeBob as the latter drives the wrong way on the road, avoiding other boats and a gasoline truck. The boat then goes out of control for a few seconds before stopping on the road again.] SpongeBob: Well, at least I didn't hit the Krusty Krab that time. [chuckles nervously. The scene cuts to the other boats that were avoiding Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob crashing into the Krusty Krab, including the gasoline truck exploding the Krusty Krab with Squidward left standing] [Bubble transition to the worker giving Mr. Krabs a bill until SpongeBob crashes into the Krusty Krab once more and the worker then increases the bill.] Mr. Krabs: Saw that coming. [Bubble transition to a sad SpongeBob.] SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. The fire in my belly has gone... [imitates explosion] ] Mr. Krabs: No, no. It's my fault. We've been going about this all wrong, boy. It's not a pampering you'd be needing. It's a bold and reckless display of confidence! SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Mr. Krabs: You think when I was your age, I tip-toed around like a tadpole on a petunia? SpongeBob: You never! Mr. Krabs: That's right. My style was to dive in with both feet, claws snapping. [snaps his claws] SpongeBob: [while snapping his fingers] Snapping! [Bubble transition to a busy highway with many signs around.] SpongeBob: Oh, my gosh. Mr. Krabs: Thar she blows. The dreaded double roundabout, the most treacherous stretch of road in all of Bikini Bottom. To your starboard, you yield. To your port, they yield to you. And when you're in the middle, it's every man for himself and the devil take the rest! SpongeBob: [shocked] Man, I don't think I'm ready for this, Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs: [hugs SpongeBob] Nonsense, boy-o. All it takes is some confidence and a little coordination. Why, your little pet snail could do it. [puts Gary on the steering wheel] Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Uh, I thought you were just using Gary as a colorful example, Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs: Oh, he's colorful, all right. But he's also going to teach you how to drive. Now, go! [Gary drives on the roundabout successfully, watching a lot of signs, while SpongeBob covers his eyes] Atta boy! [after a few seconds, Gary pulls over ] There you go, SpongeBob. Did you see how Gary did that? SpongeBob: [opens his eyes] Uh, yeah, some of it. Mr. Krabs: Buck up, me boy-o. [points to SpongeBob] It's your turn next. SpongeBob: [happily] My turn? Gee, Mr. Krabs, you must really believe in me. Mr. Krabs: [while he and SpongeBob get out of the boat] Not really. [a police motorcycle stops by the boat] Police officer: Sir, is this your vehicle? Mr. Krabs: Why, yes. Yes, officer, it is. Police officer: And did I just see you let a snail negotiate this vehicle through a dangerous intersection? Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] You sure did...uh, I mean, you didn't...I mean, well, no...I mean, well, yes...I mean, uh, look, it was just a friendly, little example: a colorful example. [pats SpongeBob] I was teaching the lad to drive. Police officer: By putting a snail behind the wheel. Mr. Krabs: Well, I mean, really, he has more on top of the wheel. Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Officer, I don't have the boating handbook with me, but... Mr. Krabs: [interrupts SpongeBob] Quiet, boy! Let me handle this. Police officer: Are you a licensed driving instructor, sir? Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Well, no. But I taught me own little girl to drive, you see, and you understand. Do you have any kiddies of your own at home, officer? Police officer: [while writing on a piece of paper] No, I'm married to my job. Mr. Krabs: Oh. Well, um...you two seem very happy together. Police officer: Well, we've had our ups and downs, but after some couples counseling, we think we've worked out our issues. [continues writing on the paper] Mr. Krabs: [looks at a smiling SpongeBob] This ticket's coming out of your paycheck, boy. SpongeBob: [happily] Whoa! My first real traffic ticket. Police officer: [to Mr. Krabs] Oh, this is going to require something more than money, sir. Mr. Krabs: Ha! What could be worse than spending money? [looks at the written paper, then gasps] [scene cuts to Mrs. Puff's Boating School] Mrs. Puff: All right, class. Please say hello to our newest classmate...Mr. Krabs! Class [except SpongeBob]: Hello, Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob: [whispers to Mr. Krabs] Don't worry, Mr. K. I'll show you the ropes. [episode ends]"

  "synopsis": [
   "The episode opens as SpongeBob is taking his driving test yet again. He ends up leaving the driving course and wrecking the boating school and the city, before driving off an unfinished bridge and falling into an abyss. The police follow the boat and end up driving off the bridge and into the abyss themselves. SpongeBob, Mrs. Puff, and the police all land on top of a truck full of fruit punch being delivered to Shady Shoals Rest Home, causing it to fall over and spill, flooding the rest home. Although SpongeBob is responsible, the incident occurred under Mrs. Puff's supervision, and she is sent to prison for gross negligence. In prison, she realizes that she will not see SpongeBob again for a very long time, and starts to enjoy it.Meanwhile, SpongeBob is depressed that Mrs. Puff is in jail, and Patrick tells him that it is SpongeBob's fault. The duo sets out to free her from jail. First, they try to rob the bank in order to get arrested themselves, but SpongeBob gets wrapped up in the bureaucratic niceties of banking and forgets they are trying to commit a crime. Next, they disguise themselves as rocks that the prisoners smash as labor. They try to communicate with Mrs. Puff, who calls the guards, but they dismiss her conversation with two rocks as a hallucination and move her to kitchen duty. SpongeBob and Patrick are then smashed by another inmate, costing them their deposit on the costumes. Then they hide in a vat of chili in the cafeteria and offer to help Mrs. Puff escape through it, but she explains to them that she likes it in prison, which SpongeBob refuses to believe. He worries that Mrs. Puff is completely institutionalized in prison and he needs to get her out. In an attempt to coax her, SpongeBob tells Mrs. Puff if she can escape, he will stay after school and decorate the entire classroom, but Mrs. Puff refuses. She calls for the prison guards again and is reassigned again after the prison guards believe that Mrs. Puff is going crazy.SpongeBob and Patrick appear to her yet again on a coat hanger assembly line, and when she calls for a guard, he somehow perceives SpongeBob and Patrick as raw materials used to make the coat hangers and dismisses her to her cell once again. SpongeBob and Patrick then appear in Mrs. Puff's cell toilet, asking her to hop in, and when Mrs. Puff calls for a guard again, he simply flushes them down the toilet and leaves. They then appear in her bed, and Mrs. Puff calls for the guards yet again, but this time the two guards that appear are SpongeBob and Patrick in disguise. After they leave, the real guards show up after hearing her screaming and crying, but Mrs. Puff thinks its still SpongeBob and Patrick in disguise and rips off their faces. This is the last straw for the guards, who strap Mrs. Puff into a straitjacket and throw her in a padded cell for solitary confinement, convinced she's completely lost her sanity. Despite this, she is glad to finally be alone and away from SpongeBob, but suddenly his face appears all over the walls and floor of the padded cell and begins laughing at her.Mrs. Puff screams in horror at the incessant laughing as the scene transitions back to SpongeBob driving off the cliff and crashing into the fruit punch truck, once again flooding the rest home. Mrs. Puff stumbles out of the wreckage and is confronted by the police again, but to her surprise they arrest SpongeBob instead of her. From this, she concludes that her prison sentence was merely a hallucination and is happy that she's not going to jail, but after a police officer informs her that she \"already did [her] time\", Mrs. Puff suddenly sees herself wearing a prison uniform with a chain on her ankle.She once again screams in horror as the scene transitions back to her sitting in the boat going off the cliff again, seemingly having suffered another hallucination, but this time she sees Donna, a prisoner with a masculine voice from her first hallucination, driving the boat instead of SpongeBob. Screaming yet again, the scene transitions back to Mrs. Puff sitting in the boat driving off the cliff, this time with SpongeBob behind the wheel and no police cars behind them. Exasperated, Mrs. Puff says \"oh, forget it,\" immediately closing the episode."

   "[The episode starts at the boating school and Mrs. Puff is panicking while SpongeBob is in his driving test again and destroying stuff, as usual.] SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff! This is the one! This is the one! Come on, SpongeBob! Think! Think! Uhh... [destroys the lighthouse] Turn that way! Turn that way! No, turn that way! Right! Left! Oh no! No! [destroys the school building] Come on, don't ever do that! Come on! [a nuclear explosion is heard and a mushroom cloud appears] No! I'm ready! I can do this, Mrs. Puff! I can do it! I can do it! [flies through the entrance while driving, constantly destroying it, leading the fences falling down] Mrs. Puff: The driving test is over, SpongeBob. Stop the boat! SpongeBob: Wait, I can do this, Mrs. Puff! I can do this! Mrs. Puff: [SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff are out of the road] The road, SpongeBob, get back on the road! SpongeBob: [while struggling to get back on the road] Gotta pass the test! Gotta pass! [Mrs. Puff is screaming as the boat goes through a cart of watermelons and crashed it] Sandals: Hey, what do you got against the melons? Mrs. Puff: Look out! SpongeBob: [has a watermelon on his face] This must be the night driving part of the test. [Scene cuts to two police officers Nancy and Malley (Orange) using their nightsticks on hitting something offscreen] Officer Nancy: We're gonna straighten you out! Officer Malley (Orange): This'll fix ya! [They grunt as they hit a parking meter for repairs until it's straight and fixed] Now let's get that one. [points his nightstick at another broken and crooked parking meter. SpongeBob and a screaming Mrs. Puff drive by through a building, knocking it over] Officer Nancy: Barnacles, did you see that?! Officer Malley (Orange): Yeah. That guy had no front license plate. Let's get him. [SpongeBob looks back at the numerous police cars chasing behind him and Mrs. Puff] SpongeBob: Hey, look at all those police! I wonder if the president's in town. Mrs. Puff: [gasps] Look out! [Scene cuts to the mayor cutting a ribbon at the end of a bridge that is not finished] Mayor: It is with great pride that I officially open this unfinished bridge! [SpongeBob drives through the ribbon and rips it before he cuts it. The crowd of people that are gathering around the mayor take pictures. SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff do not make it on the other side of the unfinished bridge so they fall to the bottom as Mrs. Puff still screams] Mrs. Puff: Where did I go wrong?! [flashback to Mrs. Puff's first day of her new boating school] With the opening of my new boating school, I pledge that as long as a student is willing to learn, I shall never give up. [SpongeBob walks up to meet her] SpongeBob: Hi, I'm SpongeBob SquarePants. [scene cuts back to Mrs. Puff, who is still screaming. Scene then shows a retirement home where a fish in a white coat is yelling at a truck that has fruit punch] Shady Shoals Caretaker: Hurry up with that truckload of fruit punch! The seniors are getting cranky! [fish looks up and notices SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff crashing into the truck] Mrs. Puff: Alive! I'm alive! Oh, thank Neptune, I'm still...! [Suddenly, a Police squad car smashes down on the boat mobile. The other Police squad cars fall on and around the truck and others fall on the ground. The truck falls over on its side as all the fruit punch comes pouring out] Feminine Tom: [inside the retirement home, he is opening windows] Alright, seniors, let's open these windows so the world can see your nice white clothes. [Fruit punch pours in and everyone screams. Scene cuts to Fred, who is mopping the hallway and listening to \"Surfin' Summer\" by Richard Myhill on his headphones. The fruit punch fills the hallway, drains, and Fred is still mopping the same spot. Scene cuts to an elderly fish man, who is writing on some paper made out of red ink from his red pen] Elderly Fish: Oh, it's finally finished! A memoir of my life, written in red ink. [red punch comes flowing in, making his memoir papers soggy and red] Aww, barnacles! [Scene cuts back to outside where all the mess is] Mrs. Puff: Ow. SpongeBob, are you okay? SpongeBob: That depends. Did I pass? Officer Nancy: Freeze, you're under arrest! Mrs. Puff: Hold it, you can't arrest him! He's just a student driver! Officer Nancy: We're not talking about him! [Scene cuts to nightfall and Mrs. Puff wearing a prison uniform, being locked up in jail from the Bikini Bottom Jail] Mrs. Puff: But I don't belong here! It's all a big mistake! Prisoner Female #1: Yeah, I don't belong here, either! Prisoner Female #2: Me too! I'm innocent! Prisoner Female #3: [yelling in a butch Southern drawl] I belong here! [this triggers some other prisoners to complaining about their not belonging here too. Mrs. Puff walks over and sits down on the bed] Mrs. Puff: Okay. You can do this, Puff. You can get through this without losing your sanity. Oh, that's a road we don't want to go down again. Positives. Think of the positives. Let's see... I've got no more papers to grade. Yeah! [laughs then jumps to the floor] In fact, no more work. No more boating school classes. No more driving, no more SpongeBob... [Mrs. Puff's brain clicks and a sonar ping is heard] No more phone solicitors, no more SpongeBob! No more company potlucks, no more SpongeBob! [gets into bed] No more road rage, no more SpongeBob! No more insurance payments, no more SpongeBob! No more SpongeBob! [laughing] No more SpongeBob! [screaming maniacally] No more SpongeBob! [sighs] I think I'm going to like this place. [Scene cuts to her boating school, which is now deserted and dusty, with SpongeBob the only one in the room] SpongeBob: Class just isn't the same without Mrs. Puff. Just the thought of her alone and afraid in jail makes me think about her being alone and afraid in jail. I don't know how she's going to survive. [scene cuts to Mrs. Puff with a happy expression] Mrs. Puff: [hums while breaking rocks. Scene cuts to her making license plates] \u266aSmelling the pretty roses, whoo hoo hoo.\u266a [scene cuts to her lifting weights] \u266aHaaappiness is just two kinds of ice creeeeam!\u266a [cuts back to SpongeBob] SpongeBob: Oh, that poor woman. And it's all my fault. Maybe if I go talk to Patrick, he can ease my guilt. [Scene cuts to the outside of Patrick's rock] Patrick: Well, it sounds like it's all your fault. SpongeBob: Oh, you're right! Mrs. Puff's in jail and it's all because of me! I'm such a barnacle head! [Patrick takes one of his dots and puts it in the place of where his nose would be if he had one] Poor Mrs. Puff. I know, I gotta get her out! But to get her out of jail, first we gotta get in jail. Patrick: How are we gonna do that? [Scene cuts to the First Nautical Bank] SpongeBob: Alright, put the money in the bag! [he is in the bank, wearing a sock over his head, with a bag in his hands, facing the wrong way.] Put it in! Nat: [as a bank teller] Umm, you're facing the wrong way, sir. SpongeBob: [turns around and laughs, then yells again] Alright! Give me the money! Nat: Will that be from your savings or your checking account, sir? SpongeBob: Uhh, savings. Nat: May I please see some identification? SpongeBob: Sure. [takes out a card and gives it to the bank teller] Here ya go. Nat: Thank you. [SpongeBob's Jellyfishers Club Membership card is shown. As the bank teller types on the cash register, SpongeBob lifts up the sock on his head and gives Patrick a thumbs up] ...Sir, we are showing a balance of zero dollars and zero cents for both of your accounts. SpongeBob: Oh. Nat: Next! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk out of the bank] SpongeBob: Well, that went better than expected. Patrick: Yeah! I didn't think we'd get Mrs. Puff out of jail this fast! [SpongeBob's eyes rip through the sock. Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick now disguised as yellow and pink rocks] SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get into jail this time. [a truck full of rocks drives up] Fish: Hey, there's a couple. [gets out and throws the two rocks in the truck] Guard: Put your back in it, girls! [women prisoners are crushing rocks outside. The truck arrives and unloads more rocks] SpongeBob: Look, Patrick, there she is! [both jump over to Mrs. Puff where she is about to hit them] Mrs. Puff, wait, it's us, SpongeBob and Patrick! Mrs. Puff: That's funny. For a second, I thought that yellow rock talked to me. And its voice sounded a lot like... SpongeBob: SpongeBob. It's me, SpongeBob. [Mrs. Puff screams as she throws the pickaxe behind her] We're gonna bust you out of here. C'mon, Mrs. Puff! [Mrs. Puff starts shaking] Mrs. Puff: It's you. What are you doing here? Why did you follow me in here? Why?! [the first guard walks up, with Mrs. Puff's pickaxe in his head] Guard #1: Alright, Mrs. Puff, it looks like this heat's gone to your head. If you're gonna talk to rocks, I guess it's time for you to go on kitchen duty. Mrs. Puff: Yes, it must be the heat. Yes. [walks off] SpongeBob: Darn it! Okay, Patrick, let's get out of here. [a woman prisoner walks over] No, wait! [she smashes the two rocks into pieces] There goes our deposit on these costumes. [scene cuts to lunchtime where Mrs. Puff is serving chili to the prisoners.] Mrs. Puff: There you are. [a woman with a deep voice walks up to Mrs. Puff] Donna: Hey there, Puff Mama. What's today's grub? Mrs. Puff: Hi, Donna. It's chili, same as always. Let me get you some. [scoops up SpongeBob's nose and Mrs. Puff gasps] SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob! Mrs. Puff: When are these horrific hallucinations going to end? [SpongeBob gets out of the chili] SpongeBob: No, it's really me! [pulls Patrick up out of the chili] I brought Patrick along too. Patrick: Hi. Mrs. Puff: Why? SpongeBob: 'Cause we're gonna set you free! Mrs. Puff: No, I mean, why'd you bring him? [Patrick eats some chili] SpongeBob: He likes chili. Now quick, get in before someone sees. [makes a rectangle-shaped entrance in the chili] Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I am not going with you. SpongeBob: [laughs] That's a good one, Mrs. Puff. Now hop in. Come on! Patrick: SpongeBob, I think she means it. SpongeBob: Oh, that's crazy, Patrick. Mrs. Puff: He's right, SpongeBob. I'm staying. SpongeBob: But why? Mrs. Puff: I like it here. These are my people! [cut to a shot of some angry, gruff looking women prisoners] And besides, if I'm in here, that means I won't have to deal with yooou... [we see SpongeBob sad. He is sniffling as a single teardrop falls from his eye, almost crying in the chili] \u2026uranium! In the water supply. [whips out a glass of water] See? Crystal clear! [guzzles the water and tosses away the glass] Aahhhh! SpongeBob: Excuse us just one second, Mrs. Puff. [to Patrick] Patrick, she has lost it! She's completely institutionalized. She's forgotten what it's like to live on the outside. To not be in prison. [Scene cuts to Frankie Billy in traffic, then at his desk for work from the office, and then staring out his bedroom window at night] Frankie's wife: Coming to bed, honey? Frankie Billy: Yes, dear. [Scene cuts back to SpongeBob and Patrick] SpongeBob: We've got to remind her that there is a life other than this. Mrs. Puff, if you come with us, I'll stay after school and decorate the whole classroom. Mrs. Puff: For the last time, no! [SpongeBob and Patrick disappear inside the chili as a guard walks up] I'm not going with you! That's final! [notices the guard] Oh. [laughs nervously] Guard #1: Talking to inanimate objects again, huh, Puff? Hmph. Get back to your cell. No more kitchen time for you. [Mrs. Puff walks off sad. SpongeBob and Patrick watch her. Scene cuts to Mrs. Puff burning coal into wire hangers until SpongeBob and Patrick come down the conveyor belt] SpongeBob: Quick, Mrs. Puff, hop on! Mrs. Puff: Guards! Guards, come quick! [the guard runs over to her] There's a crazed ex-student of mine and his overweight friend here to break me out! Guard #1: That's just raw material used to make coat hangers. You need some rest. [grunts as he pushes the level down, squishing SpongeBob and Patrick, which fills the room up with steam.] [Scene cuts to Mrs. Puff brushing her teeth. SpongeBob and Patrick come up from the toilet] SpongeBob: Psst! [Mrs. Puff screams] Hop in, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: Guards! Guards, come look! [a guard runs over and sees SpongeBob and Patrick in the toilet] Guard #1: Whoa. They don't pay me enough to do this job. [The guard flushes the toilet, sending SpongeBob and Patrick into the sewers. Cuts to Mrs. Puff in her bed. SpongeBob and Patrick peek from the top bunk] SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, up here. Mrs. Puff: Guards, guards! They're back! [two guards walk up] Guard #1: What's all the hubbub, Puff? Mrs. Puff: They're back! [the guards remove their heads, because they're just costumes, showing them as SpongeBob and Patrick] SpongeBob and Patrick: Mrs. Puff, it's us! [both wink and give her a thumbs up] Mrs. Puff: [screams and cries as the two real guards run up] Guard #1: What the barnacle is going on? Mrs. Puff: Get away from me! Get away! Guard #1: What are you talking about, Puff? Mrs. Puff: You can't fool me! You're SpongeBob and that guy who likes the chili. [rips off the guards' faces leaving their skulls shown] Guard #1: Let's face it, Puff. You've gone off the deep end. [Scene cuts to a second guard throwing Mrs. Puff, who is in a straitjacket, in a small, yellow square room] Guard #2: Get in there, you! You need a nice long stay in solitary confinement! [slams the door, which makes a squeaking sound] Mrs. Puff: Oh, well. Let's look at the positives again. I'm finally away from those two. Yes. All alone in my nice, soft room. SpongeBob: Made of sponge! [laughs. The room is made of yellow sponge as SpongeBob's face appears on all sides of the wall. Mrs. Puff screams as the scene goes back to SpongeBob driving in mid-air with the police behind them again.] I can pass the test, Mrs. Puff! I can pass the test! [The boats crash into the truck full of fruit punch, knocking it over, and spilling again] Officer Malley (Green): Freeze! Your joyride's over, punk. [police officers walk over] Mrs. Puff: No! What? [policemen arrest SpongeBob this time, because he now failed the driving test] Huh? What? SpongeBob: No. No! What are you doing?! Help! Help! [As the officers carry him to the jail vehicle, he kicks his legs.] No, no, please! No! I have a snail to feed! I can't go to jail now! This is not a good time! No, please, please! I'm not a criminal! [They throw him into the back of the police car, then drives off to jail] Mrs. Puff: I can't believe it. It was all a dream. I'm not going to jail! Officer Malley (Orange): Why would you go to jail? You already did your time. [zoom out to reveal Mrs. Puff wearing prison striped clothes of black and white with a prison ball chained to her ankle. She screams as the scene goes back to her screaming while the boat is in mid-air again as she's driving it with the police behind her] Mrs. Puff: Huh? Oh... it's just my imagination again. [zooms out to show Donna driving the boat] Donna: So, what's for dinner tonight, Puff Mama, chili? [Mrs. Puff screams again as the scene goes back to her with SpongeBob driving the boat in mid-air one last time, but without the police cars behind them] Mrs. Puff: Huh? What? Huh? Ah, forget it. [the episode ends]"
