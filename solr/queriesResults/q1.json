  "synopsis": "The narrator opens the episode by stating \"It is a very special day in Bikini Bottom.\" The camera then shows SpongeBob and Patrick heading down to Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Once they arrive at the entrance, Patrick says he brought SpongeBob's special learning cards that has everything he needs to pass the boating school test. However, Patrick then eats the cards and claims learning tastes good. Even though SpongeBob needed those learning cards, Patrick convinces SpongeBob that he is a winner and does not need them. SpongeBob then claims he is a winner and takes his boating school driving test.Unfortunately, after one minute and thirty-seven seconds, SpongeBob fails the driving test for the 58th time. Patrick, thinking the test is rigged, decides to take the test himself and passes with a perfect score on the first try, much to SpongeBob's surprise and jealousy. They go to receive Patrick's license, but while his picture is being taken, an announcer comes out to reveal that since he is the one millionth person to pass the test, he has won a brand new hot red boatmobile, the new Bass Blaster 3000.SpongeBob and Patrick drive home in Patrick's new boatmobile while Patrick talks about how fun driving is, much to SpongeBob's disappointment. That night, Patrick is heard working on his boatmobile and comes to SpongeBob's door at 4 AM to show his new license. SpongeBob tries to get some sleep, but is woken up the next minute by his alarm clock.SpongeBob, now very tired, tries to walk to work, but, unable to walk because of his tiredness, he eventually gets a ride from Patrick, who rubs his license in SpongeBob's face and brags even more. When SpongeBob gets to work, he tries to talk himself out of riding with Patrick, but finds out that Mr. Krabs has chosen him to run the Krusty Krab's new drive-thru. He meets Patrick and his boat again.At closing time, Patrick drives up, now wearing a racing outfit, claiming that he must keep up his image as an \"expert driver.\" While driving around, Patrick rubs his license in SpongeBob's face even more, even stopping to talk to SpongeBob's parents about it and embarrass SpongeBob. Patrick then starts driving slightly above the speed limit, which prompts SpongeBob to try and get him in trouble for speeding, but he fails since he tells Patrick to stop and a police officer tells him he's going far under the limit. Patrick then runs three red lights, and makes an offscreen illegal U-turn through an orphanage.Furious, SpongeBob finally snaps after Patrick calls himself a \"driving genius,\" admitting his jealousy toward him and this would have been his boat if he passed. Patrick calls out SpongeBob for his jealousy and that he should be happy for him getting his license, but SpongeBob chews his friend back for rubbing his license in his face. Patrick denies this accusation and literally shoves his license between SpongeBob's eyes. In a final fit of fury, an enraged SpongeBob tears up the license and throws it out the window, much to Patrick's despair. This gets the attention of the police officer from earlier and causes a whole squad of cop cars to chase after SpongeBob and Patrick. When the police yell for Patrick to pull over, he instead begins driving out of control, not knowing what to do since he no longer has his license, and eventually drives off of a cliff into the Bikini Bottom Jail yard with the police following after him.Patrick is put on trial and found guilty of littering. The judge gives him 90 days in jail to hold him accountable. However, a remorseful SpongeBob admits the truth and gets the 90 day jail sentence in Patrick's place. When SpongeBob is happily released, he gives a delighted Patrick a new license plate for his boatmobile, but Patrick reveals that he threw out the boatmobile because it stopped working when it got to \"e\" which he thought meant \"end,\" which really meant \"empty\" as in out of gas. As the episode concludes, SpongeBob and Patrick pretend to play boats with SpongeBob putting the license on Patrick's butt and riding him away.",

  "transcript": "French Narrator: It is a very special day in Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob: I'm ready! [walking up to Mrs. Puff's Boating School with Patrick] I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards? Patrick: Right here, buddy. [takes them out of his pocket] Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards. [eats the cards] Mmm. SpongeBob: No, Patrick! Patrick: Hey, learning tastes good. SpongeBob: Patrick, I needed those. Patrick: Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone. SpongeBob: 57 times. Patrick: Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner. SpongeBob: I'm a winner? Patrick: Who's a winner? SpongeBob: [sadly] I'm a winner. Patrick: Who's a winner? SpongeBob: [cheered up a little] I'm a winner. Patrick: Who's a winner?! SpongeBob: I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner! [runs into the classroom] French Narrator: One minute thirty seven seconds later... [SpongeBob walks up crying] Patrick: How'd you do, winner? [SpongeBob's crying continues] Let's see that license. SpongeBob: I didn't get a license, Patrick. Patrick: Are they gonna mail it to you? SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all. Patrick: No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged. SpongeBob: Let's just go home, Patrick. Patrick: We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself. SpongeBob: [hanging onto Patrick's pants] No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive. [Patrick's pants rip off] Patrick: Please, SpongeBob. I think I know what I'm doing. SpongeBob: No, Patrick. No! Mrs. Puff: [Patrick walks up to the boat she is sitting in and gets in it, in his underwear] Good morning. Patrick: You're not the judge of me! Mrs. Puff: Actually, I am. Let the testing begin! [clicks her pen. Scene cuts to SpongeBob, outside the boating school] SpongeBob: I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I? Patrick: SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob: I'm here for you, buddy. Patrick: I passed my test! SpongeBob: You got a perfect score? Patrick: Yeah, I thought you said it was hard. SpongeBob: Perfect score. [eye twitches] Patrick: Come on, I'm gonna get my picture taken for my new license. [scene cuts to the license registration building] Miss Shell: Stand behind the line, sir. Patrick: [smiling] How do I look? SpongeBob: [sarcastically] Like a winner. Miss Shell: Ready? Patrick: Ready. [banner comes down which says \"CONGRATULATIONS\" on it. Balloons and confetti fall] SpongeBob: Huh? Fish: Congratulations, Mr. Star. You're the one millionth person to pass the test. Patrick: Does that mean I get a free key chain? Fish: Uhh, no. Patrick: Oh. Fish: You get a brand-new boat mobile. The new Bass Blaster 3000. The ultimate boating machine. [Patrick runs up to the new boatmobile as SpongeBob's jaw drops] Patrick: Yeah! All right! Fish: Women will want you. [all sigh] Men will want to be you. [all faint] You'll be the envy of your friends. [SpongeBob growling in fury] Patrick: Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat. SpongeBob: I'm so happy for you... [\"La Cucaracha\" horn blows in his face] Whoa! Patrick: The horn works. [scene cuts to Patrick driving his new boat down the road] Woo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license. Patrick: Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license. SpongeBob: Two millionth? Patrick: Then you can get a free boat just like me. SpongeBob: Yeah, just like you. Patrick: I try to serve as an inspiration to others. SpongeBob: Can we go home now? [zoom out and scene shows Patrick driving around his rock over and over] We've been driving around your house for hours. Patrick: I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it? SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride, Patrick. Patrick: No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian. [shudders then drives off. SpongeBob imitates Patrick. Scene cuts to SpongeBob in bed asleep. His clock turns to 3:00am when an engine revving is heard which sends SpongeBob into his diving board then back into his bed] SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing? Patrick: I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep. [SpongeBob groans and slams his window shut, breaking it, before going back to bed. Scene cuts to 4:00am] SpongeBob: 4:00? [yawns. Doorbell rings] Who could be at the door at this hou\u2014 [falls down the stairs. Opens the door] Now what is it, Patrick? Patrick: You will never guess what happen to me today. SpongeBob: You got your license. Patrick: Yeah! [shows his license] But that's not all. SpongeBob: You got a new boat. Patrick: Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life. [walks off] SpongeBob: [gets back into bed] Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep. [foghorn alarm blows] Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat. [scene cuts to morning where SpongeBob is leaving home to go to work] I'm so tired. [horn honks] Patrick: Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work? SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work. [tries to take a step, but falls down in the process. Scene cuts to Patrick driving SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab] Patrick: Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license. SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride. Patrick: No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license. [SpongeBob is getting extremely enraged] SpongeBob: That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile... Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru. SpongeBob: When did we get a drive-thru? Mr. Krabs: I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams. SpongeBob: I used to have a dream. Mr. Krabs: Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living. SpongeBob: [through headphones] Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I\u2014 [\"La Cucaracha\" horn honks] Patrick: The horn still works. [scene cuts to SpongeBob switching the OPEN sign to CLOSED then walking out of work. Patrick drives up in a racing uniform] Hey, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: What's with the helmet, Patrick? Patrick: Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image. [clicks tongue] SpongeBob: Uh-huh. [scene cuts to Patrick driving] Patrick: Boy, driving is so easy. SpongeBob: Oh? Patrick: Do you want me to give you lessons? SpongeBob: [sarcastic] Oh, that would be great. Patrick: Oh! [drives over to SpongeBob's parents] SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick: Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy. Mr. SquarePants: Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you? We're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours. Patrick: What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test. Mrs. SquarePants: That's great, Patrick. Patrick: SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it. Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield. SpongeBob: Mom! Patrick: Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides. SpongeBob: Hey! [Patrick drives off] Mr. SquarePants: Even Patrick has a license. [both parents sigh] Patrick: Let's see what this baby can do. [steps on the gas. Ride pass a sign that reads 'SPEED LIMIT 40 MPH'] SpongeBob: Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph. Patrick: Yeah, yeah. SpongeBob: [reads the speedometer] 40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car. [car stops next to a policeman] Patrick: What? Where? Who? SpongeBob: Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun? Officer: Umm... okay. [uses radar gun. It reads 0mph] Actually, he's going 40mph under the limit. So, move along before I run you in, tattletale. [drives off] SpongeBob: Are you sure you don't want to run him in? [scene cuts to Patrick driving. Green light turns red] It's a red light, Patrick! [Patrick runs through three red lights] Patrick, you just ran three red lights! Patrick: So? SpongeBob: You're suppose to stop! Patrick: I think the driving genius knows what he's doing. SpongeBob: [finally snaps] Driving genius?! Would a genius make an illegal u-turn...through an orphanage?! Patrick: They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about? SpongeBob: I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile! Patrick: How can you say that? If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license! SpongeBob: If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face! Patrick: I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face! [takes out license and rubs it in SpongeBob's face--literally--which makes muffled noises] SpongeBob: [fixes his face and then furiously snatches Patrick's license out of his hand] Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this! [furiously tears up Patrick's license then laughs maniacally. The pieces of the license fly into the cop's hands.] Officer: Huh, litterbugs. This is why I joined the force. [drives off after SpongeBob & Patrick] SpongeBob & Patrick: It's the police! Officer: [over speaker] Pull it over, litterbug! Patrick: Litterbug?! No! [drives faster] Officer: Ooh, I got me a runner. [a bunch of police cars are following him] SpongeBob: Patrick, what do you think you're doing? Patrick: I don't know! I don't have a license anymore. [drives around cards, through a sign then off a cliff into the front lot of the Bikini Bottom Jail. Scene cuts to courtroom] Judge: 90 days. I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering. Patrick: So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. [a security guard takes him away, but he ducks his head back in] Sometimes you forget to feed him. [ducks out of the shot] SpongeBob: What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait! [runs up to the judge] Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead. Judge: Well, considering there's no legal precedent... oh, what the heck. 90 days! [a smiling SpongeBob is put in jail] French Narrator: One debt to society later... [After SpongeBob's 90 day sentence, shows the jail as the door buzzes. SpongeBob is let go out of jail where Patrick is waiting for him; the two silently stare at each other smiling for about ten seconds as an orchestra swells dramatically.] SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick: SpongeBob! [both hug] SpongeBob: I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever. [shows him a license plate that reads \"PALS 4 EVER\"] Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy. Patrick: Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore. SpongeBob: What? Patrick: It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E, and I figured that must mean \"end\". SpongeBob: Oh, then... what do we do with this? [Patrick takes it and puts it on his behind] Patrick: How's that? SpongeBob: Yeah! Patrick: Ready, buddy? SpongeBob: Ready, pal. [hops on Patrick's shoulders and makes car noises] Woo! Woo!",

  "synopsis": "The episode starts off with a boating film named Safety At Sea: \"An Educational Boating Film.\" Mrs. Puff comes out and tells the audience that she will help student drivers learn the rules to earn their license.Lesson #1: \"The Five-Point Pre-Check.\" Squidward demonstrates checking his boat before driving: checking the tire buoyancy, ensures the propeller is oiled, confirms the horn works, tests his signals, and fastens his seatbelt. SpongeBob is used to demonstrate improper driving: he over-inflates his tires, dumps too much oil on the propeller and splashes it on Squidward, honks the horn too hard, and spins his signals fast enough that the boat takes flight. While putting his seatbelt on, he wraps it around the entire boat. Its tires pop and it falls onto Squidward's boat. SpongeBob asks if he can get his license now, and Mrs. Puff says no.Lesson #2: \"Entering Traffic.\" Squidward, still injured, inches forward and waits for traffic to clear up. When the roads are clear, he looks both ways and moves forward slightly. SpongeBob comes from the side and rams into him, sending Squidward's boat flying into a billboard. SpongeBob asks for his license again, and Mrs. Puff says no.Lesson #3: \"Spotting Pedestrians.\" Squidward watches out for pedestrians: he swerves around an old lady and a baby. When he is about to run into a fruit cart, he lifts his boat up to evade it. He then spots two workers carrying a pane of glass, but runs off two boards and a truck as a ramp to go over them. SpongeBob suddenly jumps into his way, bouncing on a pogo stick. Squidward almost runs into the old lady again, but she reveals her muscles and destroys his car, throwing it into a garbage truck. SpongeBob bounces into the camera, asking for his license.Due to a missing reel, the video skips ahead to Lesson #29: \"Navigation.\" Squidward, now heavily bandaged and with his boat damaged, first runs over some speed bumps. Next, he sees children crossing, but they are so slow that he drives around them. Overwhelmed by directions, Squidward checks his map and goes into the freeway -- only for Mrs. Puff to narrate that reading a map while driving is bad driving etiquette, to his embarrassment. SpongeBob shows up driving the wrong way, skidding against Squidward's boat and sending him out of control. Squidward's boat goes off an unfinished bridge and explodes.The reel skips ahead to Lesson #53: \"Proper Passenger Etiquette.\" An even more injured Squidward is driving with SpongeBob as his passenger. SpongeBob tells Squidward that he will earn his license, jumping on the dashboard and blocking his vision. Squidward pushes him away. When Mrs. Puff tells him not to be a \"backseat driver,\" he grabs hold of Squidward's brace and makes him drive out-of-control. Next, SpongeBob turns up the music too loud, then sets the AC too cold and too hot. He sets the car in reverse, almost crashing into the children until Squidward takes control again. Squidward shoves SpongeBob in the glove compartment.Lesson #54: \"Road Rage.\" Patrick passes Squidward, making him angry and leading him to speed up. Mrs. Puff narrates an acronym, \"RAGE: Relax And Go Elsewhere.\" SpongeBob comes out of the glove compartment and helps Squidward relax through deep breathing, drinking tea, and raking a small Zen garden. Just after Squidward is finally relaxed, it turns out that the car is completely stopped and there is a long line of traffic behind them. Squidward tries to start the car, but it sputters instead. A large trucker steps out and grabs Squidward. Before he can punch him, the film itself burns up and disintegrates.The episode switches format, with only the character's silhouettes being seen against the projector. SpongeBob tries to fix it, but gets caught in it himself. Mrs. Puff tells him to get out, and says that they cannot finish the film, walking off as the class cheers. SpongeBob still wants to finish class and get his license, so he tries to make the video himself.SpongeBob's \"film\" opens with a crudely-drawn prop of his driver's license. SpongeBob narrates that he was such a good driver that he got a ceremony in his honor. He then brings peace to the world by delivering Krabby Patties, catching criminals, and preventing the ice caps from melting. In the final shot, cutouts of Mrs. Puff and Squidward start kissing him.Mrs. Puff snaps and turns the lights on, revealing SpongeBob making the video himself using paper cut-outs in front of the projector screen. She dismisses the students, then throws SpongeBob's cut-outs into the fireplace. The students drive their desks out of class, but Mrs. Puff grabs SpongeBob and takes him back in. She confiscates his paper license, tears it up, then kicks him out of class and slams the door.",

  "transcript": "[The episode opens with the text \"PICTURE START\" written in white against a black screen, then inverting. An old-timey countdown plays. More text appears, reading \"Safety At Sea: 'An Educational Boating Film.'\" It flickers to a shot of the outside of Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Mrs. Puff comes out of the front door.] Mrs. Puff: Hello, student drivers! I'm Mrs. Penelope Puff, and, as per the court order, I will be your driving instructor in this educational film. By remembering these [takes out list] 138 simple rules of the road, [throws list away] every one of you will know all that you need to get your very own boating license. [Cut to SpongeBob having crashed a boat into a brick wall.] SpongeBob: [spaced out] Even me? Mrs. Puff: [shrugs, disappointed] Ugh. [Text appears saying \"#1 The Five Point Pre Check.\"] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] First lesson: the five point pre check [The text disappears to show Squidward standing next to a boat.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Here we have Mr. Good Driver. Before starting the vehicle, he always inspects five areas of his boat for safety. [Squidward nods.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] He checks his tire buoyancy... [Squidward kneels down to the boat's tires, points at a meter, and reads it.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Ensures his motor is properly oiled... [Squidward squeezes a small drop of oil onto the boat's motor, then flicks it.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Confirms his boat horn is functioning... [Squidward is inside the boat, and he honks his horn twice.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Reviews his signals... [Two flags come out of the boat and move in various directions.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] And most importantly, he fastens his seatbelt. [Squidward fastens his seatbelt and clasps his hands as a halo appears above him. The camera pans over to show SpongeBob standing at another boat.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] And here we have a bad driver, or, what I refer to as \"a SpongeBob.\" SpongeBob: Check tire pressure! [He inflates all the boat's tires to a large size.] Oil propeller: check! [He dumps a bucket of oil onto the propellor, which spins rapidly and splatters on Squidward, who grumbles.] Check horn: check! [He honks the horn very hard.] Horn: [screaming] Out of the way! [Squidward is blown back by the horn's noise, also spraying the oil off him.] SpongeBob: Check signals! Checkareeno! [SpongeBob twirls his signal flags so fast that the boat takes flight.] SpongeBob: Seatbelt! [stretches it and ties it around the entire boat] Belted! [The boat falls and the tires pop, sending it flipping backwards onto Squidward] Whoa! [comes out of the overturned boat and waves] Can I get my license now? [The word \"NO\" is stamped on the screen.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] No. [Text appears saying \"#2 Entering Traffic\"] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Now to our second lesson: entering traffic. [Cut to Squidward, who has a black eye and a bump on his head as stars circle around him.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] As he begins his journey, Mr. Good Driver makes sure to watch carefully for oncoming boats. [Squidward goes forward, and two lines of boats are in front of him. He looks to his sides, and the traffic clears up, leaving the road empty.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Only when the road is clear does he accelerate into traffic. [Squidward looks to his sides, and no boats are coming. He inches forward. Suddenly, SpongeBob drives in from the left and crashes into him.] SpongeBob: Beep beep! [Squidward's boat smashes into a billboard that says \"Yum! Dogs!\" with a fish eating a hot dog, with his boat covering the hot dog.] SpongeBob: [waving] Can I get my license now? [The word \"NO\" is stamped on the screen again.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] No! [Text appears saying \"#3 Spotting Pedestrians\"] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Lesson 3: spotting pedestrians. [Squidward is driving on the road, now with a bandaged head, a bandage on his nose, two black eyes, and a scratched boat.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] There are several types of pedestrians, so Mr. Good Driver always keeps careful watch. [Squidward puts on a safari hat and takes out binoculars, then starts looking around him. He sees an old lady doing acrobatics across the street.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Here we have the cunning little old lady. [Squidward screams in surprise, then drives around her. He looks ahead and sees a baby in a carraige.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Ah, and the babbling baby in a buggy. [The baby spits out its pacifier.] Baby: [angry gibberish] [Squidward swerves around the baby and continues driving. A starfish is seen with a cart of fruit.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] The common fruit vendor... [Squidward pulls his boat up, and it goes over the fruit cart. Two worker fish come out of the sewer holding a pane of glass. They notice Squidward and begin sidestepping to avoid him.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] And, naturally, we see some workmen carrying a large pane of glass. Squidward: How cliche! [He notices a truck with two wooden boards as ramps behind it. He drives off of it to go clear over the workers, who gasp and watch. Sunglasses fall onto Squidward's face.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Mr. Good Driver may think he can let his guard down, but there's still one pedestrian waiting to strike. [A trash can rumbles. SpongeBob's eyes peer out of it, and he jumps out onto the street with a pogo stick. He stops in front of Squidward, and the screen freezes with the caption \"Poriferous Aggravatus.\"] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] The rare Poriferous Aggravatus. Commonly known as \"a SpongeBob.\" SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! [Squidward screams and starts swerving, but SpongeBob keeps jumping in front of him.] SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! Hi, Squidward! Hi, Squidward! Hi, Squidward! [Squidward screams and notices the old lady from before. She flexes her muscles, and the boat crashes into her. She smashes it up and throws it into a garbage truck. SpongeBob gets off his pogo stick and jumps towards the screen.] SpongeBob: Hey! Can I get my license now? [Text appears saying \"REEL MISSING\". It switches to \"#29 Navigation\".] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Lesson 29: navigation. [Squidward now has a neck brace and bandaged arms, and his boat is in worse condition.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Mr. Good Driver must obey various road signs. Here are just a few. [a sign with a tire appears] Speed bumps... [Squidward drives over many speeds bumps in succession, sputtering as he does. A sign with three kids on it appears.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Slow children at play... [Squidward runs into three children crossing the street. They move in slow-motion. Squidward gets impatient waiting for them to pass and drives around them. As he keeps driving, he sees a massive amount of road signs.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Sometimes even Mr. Good Driver may be overwhelmed with directions. [Squidward panics and takes out a map as he heads onto the freeway.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Never read a road map while driving. That's something only a SpongeBob would do. [Squidward laughs nervously and packs up the map. SpongeBob is heading the opposite direction, reading an open map. Passengers scream and swerve around him.] SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! [Squidward screams and his boat collides with SpongeBob's. He is sent spinning out of control and slides off of an unfinished exit. His boat explodes, and the reel skips. Text displays \"#53 Proper Passenger Etiquette.\"] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Lesson 53: proper passenger etiquette. [Squidward now has his arm and head in a cast, with a blood drip hooked to his arm. His feet are bandaged. SpongeBob sits in the passenger seat.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Good driving also means being a good passenger. Never distract your driver. SpongeBob: Guess what, Squidward? I'm gonna get my license today! [slides onto the dashboard] Mrs. Puff said at the end of the film, I'm gonna get it! [Squidward can't see the road with SpongeBob blocking his view.] Squidward: Oh, you're gonna \"get it,\" alright! [shoves him into the backseat] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] It's also important not to be a backseat driver. SpongeBob: Ooh! I can drive from the backseat? [SpongeBob grabs Squidward's head brace and twists his neck, causing the boat to go out of control.] Squidward: That's it! You're driving me crazy! [The boat halts, and SpongeBob falls back into the passenger seat. Squidward starts driving again.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Finally, as a passenger, you must never play with the boat's control console. SpongeBob: Ah, let's get some tunes goin' here! [SpongeBob turns the radio on, and techno music plays, causing the boat to bump up and down and buildings' windows to break.] SpongeBob: How about some AC? [SpongeBob turns the AC to the left, causing a large blast of snow. He and Squidward look like snowmen.] SpongeBob: Brrr! Too cold! [He turns the AC to the right, causing a blast of flame that melts the snow. Squidward is burned, with three flames on his head brace.] SpongeBob: Ooh, let me help you with that! [As he goes to put out a flame, he grabs onto the gear stick and puts it into reverse. The boat speeds backwards. The children are still at play.] Children: [slow-motion] Oh no! [Squidward grabs the gear stick and puts the boat back into drive. SpongeBob giggles nervously, and Squidward growls and shoves him into the glove compartment.] [Text appears saying \"#54 Road Rage\"] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Lesson 54: road rage. [Squidward is driving angrily.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Even Mr. Good Driver may be tempted to take his anger out on a fellow motorist... [Patrick drives up and passes Squidward. Squidward gets angry, his head cast breaks off, his face goes red, and he slams on the gas pedal.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] In times like these, remember one simple word: RAGE. [the word appears as a caption] Relax And Go Elsewhere. [the rest of the text appears] SpongeBob: [in glove compartment] Oh, I know this one! [lets himself out, buckles his seatbelt, and rubs Squidward's head] Let me help you relax, friend. Just breathe in... and out. [Squidward does, and the redness from his face disappears.] SpongeBob: That's it. [takes out tea] Now how about a relaxing cup of kelp tea? [He pours the tea in Squidward's mouth. Squidward sighs and smiles.] SpongeBob: Refreshing, right? Squidward: Mmm-hmmm. SpongeBob: Now, let's rake some sand. [SpongeBob pours a bucket of sand on the dashboard. Squidward rakes a small spiral around a rock, then smile at each other.] SpongeBob: There. Relaxed... [Their boat is completely stopped. There is a long line of angry passengers behind it.] SpongeBob: Maybe it's time to go elsewhere? [Squidward tries to start the boat, but it sputters. A large trucker steps out of his truck and grabs Squidward, then winds up to punch him. Before he does, the film itself disintegrates, leaving nothing but a gray projector screen. Characters' shadows are seen as they talk.] Mrs. Puff: This darn projector! Just when we were getting to the good part! SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff! Let a good noodle handle that for ya! Mrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, that's okay! [SpongeBob walks up to the screen and tries to pull it open. He gets sucked in headfirst, and his entire body takes up the screen.] SpongeBob: Huh? Huh? [looks at screen] I'm ready for my close-up! [laughs] Mrs. Puff: Get out of there! SpongeBob: [nervously] Yes, ma'am! [SpongeBob detaches himself from the projector.] Mrs. Puff: Ugh! Well, I guess we can't finish the film... [walks off] [The students start cheering.] SpongeBob: B-b-but if we can't finish the film, we can't finish class! [The students cheer again.] SpongeBob: And if we can't finish class, then I can't get my license! [The students cheer again.] SpongeBob: I know! I'll finish the film myself! [The students boo.] [SpongeBob sticks his foot against the projector.] SpongeBob: [narrating] And now, the moment you've all been waiting for! [scatting] [SpongeBob holds up a poorly-made prop driver's license on a stick and waves it around.] SpongeBob: [narrating] SpongeBob's boating license! SpongeBob was such an exemplary driver... Mrs. Puff: [narrating, exasperated] Oh, please ... [The screen wraps up to show a City Hall backdrop. A cutout of SpongeBob sits on a throne.] SpongeBob: [narrating] That a special ceremony was held in his honor at City Hall! It was a dream come true! [A cutout of Mrs. Puff descends, holding a license.] SpongeBob: [narrating] Mrs. Puff had deemed him worthy of the road! [A poorly constructed model of SpongeBob holds up the license.] SpongeBob: [narrating] He finally had a dazzling, genuine, full-sized boating license! [A cutout of SpongeBob drives on top of a rotating image of Earth.] SpongeBob: [narrating] Now, imbued with the power of good driving, [the Earth flips to reveal a peace sign] SpongeBob brought peace to the people of this troubled world! [A cutout of SpongeBob drives up to a house, then throws a giant Krabby Patty at the person inside. The person's frown flips upside down and hearts appear.] SpongeBob: [narrating] He delivered Krabby Patties to the hungry! [Cutouts of a robber stealing a purse from an old lady are shown. SpongeBob's boat drives up, opens its front as a mouth, and a tongue grabs and eats the robber. The lady holds up her purse.] SpongeBob: [narrating] He de-escalated petty crime! [A cutout of SpongeBob pushes a frowning iceberg into another one, making them smile and hug.] SpongeBob: [narrating] And he even kept the ice caps from melting! [A cutout of SpongeBob stands in front of a heart backdrop.] SpongeBob: [narrating] Yes, everyone loved SpongeBob more than ever now that he had his boating license! They all loved him sooo much! Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah! [Cutouts of Mrs. Puff and Squidward start kissing SpongeBob. In the classroom, Mrs. Puff seethes in anger.] Mrs. Puff: [angry] That is quite enough! [She slams her fist into the light switch, causing the lights to come on and the switch to fall off. Cut to SpongeBob, surrounded by craft supplies, making the movie in front of the projector screen.] Mrs. Puff: We'll resume the correct lesson next week. Class is dismissed. [clasps hands] Just remember what you learned today... [grabs cutouts] And no more of this nonsense! [She wads up the cutouts and throws them into a fireplace.] Students: Yes, Mrs. Puff. [They rev up their desks like boats and drive out. SpongeBob is the last, and Mrs. Puff grabs him before he can leave the school. Mrs. Puff holds out her hand, and SpongeBob laughs nervously. He gives her his prop license, which she tears apart. Mrs. Puff kicks him out of the school.] SpongeBob: Beep beep! [Mrs. Puff glares at him and then slams the door shut, ending the episode.]",

  "synopsis": "The episode starts with SpongeBob recklessly driving. He suddenly thinks of blowing bubbles to relax after getting stressed. It soon backfires when the distraction of said bubbles causes his boat to eventually crash. Mrs. Puff loses her temper and she harshly yells at SpongeBob that he is hopeless at getting a driver's license, and he walks off sad. He then sees Larry, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick have their own boats. He only gets sadder each time he sees his friends with a boat.He sits behind his house blowing bubbles. He wishes that he could be as good as driving boats as he is for blowing bubbles. Suddenly, he has the idea of blowing a bubble boat to drive in. Everyone is pleased with the new boat type. A policeman notices and says that every vehicle requires a license, but SpongeBob replies that no license is required for driving a bubble. The policeman then agrees. SpongeBob gets home to tell Gary all the good news on his new bubble boat experience, though Gary just ignores him.Soon, everyone is desperately wanting bubble boats, so SpongeBob gets a giant container of bubble mix into a tub. Afterward, SpongeBob makes a bubble boat for everyone.Meanwhile, Mrs. Puff notices everyone has a bubble boat. She is trying to drive home with her normal boat, but this angers many of the bubble boat drivers, as well as the police towing away her normal boat. Puff then has to go to Bubble Boating School, a temporary boating school run by SpongeBob.At Bubble Boating School, SpongeBob teaches Mrs. Puff about how to drive a bubble boat. She eventually understands how to ride a bubble boat, after going through mastering multiple dangerous obstacle courses. She then does her final test, being on the real road.During her final bubble-boating test, she is happily talking to SpongeBob about the bubble boats, but soon gets distracted and goes to the highway instead of continuing on the small roads. She ends up crashing, leading her to involuntarily expand, which makes her cause further mayhem to the bubble boaters. SpongeBob ends up saving all of them just in time.Soon, the police come to tell everyone, including SpongeBob, that bubble boats are now outlawed and normal boats have been re-legalized. SpongeBob then tells Mrs. Puff that he will see her again at boating school the next day. At the end of the episode, Mrs. Puff expands and sighs before she pops herself.",

  "transcript": "[The episode begins with SpongeBob once again trying to pass his boating test. SpongeBob is driving out of control.] Mrs. Puff: Look out! Oh! [SpongeBob hits the boat against the fence and the boat bounces back on the road. The boat swerves around in circles and a passing driver crash into the fence.] Driver 1: Learn how to drive! SpongeBob: I'm trying! Mrs. Puff: Calm down, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff! [SpongeBob comes up with an idea as a bottle of bubble soap appears above his head.] SpongeBob: Nothing soothes one's frazzled nerves like blowing bubbles! [blows lot of bubbles that covers the boat] Mrs. Puff: No blowing bubbles while driving! [SpongeBob's bubbles pops into the eyes of many drivers. SpongeBob's boat stops.] Mrs. Puff: Phew! [sighs] [The drivers appear out of the cloud of bubbles and crash into SpongeBob's boat, inflating Mrs. Puff in the process. SpongeBob laughs nervously as the drivers moan and groan in pain. Firefighters arrive to put out the fire.] Driver 2: I can't feel my big toe. SpongeBob: So, uh, how'd I do? Mrs. Puff: [deflates herself] Get out! You're never getting a boating license! SpongeBob: [whimpers as he goes to leave] But\u2014but\u2014 Mrs. Puff: [screams] Never! Never! [SpongeBob curls up and sulks away. A piece of debris falls on Mrs. Puff's head, inflating her again.] SpongeBob: I'll never pass my driver's test, I'll never get my license, and I'll never know the joys of boat ownership! [SpongeBob notices Larry's boat at his gym.] Nancy Suzy Fish: Ooh... Tina Fran: It's really nice. [The girls giggle.] Larry: Oh, yeah, it's a turbo jet. 390 sea horse power with 11-to-1 pop-up piston. [chest revs like a racecar engine] We're talking some serious muscle! [Larry turns on his boat and his engine roars.] Tina Fran: I love your boat, Larry! [hugs the tire] [SpongeBob murmurs as he sees Larry's boat. He sulks off as the girls continue to admire Larry and his boat. SpongeBob continues to sulk back to his house until he sees Mr. Krabs washing his boat.] Mr. Krabs: Oh, hey there, boyo! Lovely day for a boat wash! [wrings out his sponge] Isn't it? [SpongeBob runs away, crying.] Mr. Krabs: Whoa. Maybe I shouldn't have borrowed Pearl's shorts. [SpongeBob stops running and continues to cry. Then he notices Patrick.] SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, you want to hang out? Patrick: Wish I could, SpongeBob, but I'm kind of busy spending time with my boat right now. SpongeBob: Your boat. [shrinks] Sure, Patrick. See you later. [whimpers] [Patrick hums as he takes out a flying disc.] Patrick: Catch! [throws flying disc at the boat] [The scene changes to SpongeBob sulking behind his house. He blows a bubble version of Mrs. Puff.] Bubble Mrs. Puff: You're a very good driver, SpongeBob, and my favorite student. Here's your license. [The Bubble Mrs. Puff blows a bubble license and gives it to SpongeBob before she pops.] SpongeBob: Ooh! [bubble license pops] Aww! If only I was as good at driving as I am at blowing bubbles. [sulks down; gasps] Oh! That's it! [The scene changes to SpongeBob putting on some shades.] Abigail Marge: Whoa! Tom: What is that? [SpongeBob appears to be driving in a bubble-shaped boat. As he drives it, everyone seems to take notice of it. He stops at a stoplight.] Girls: Oh! SpongeBob: All right, all right. [SpongeBob bounces inside his bubble boat and makes it go faster. A boat in back of the girls' boat crashes at seeing SpongeBob's bubble boat. Just then, a motorcycle cop comes by.] SpongeBob: Pleasant day for a drive, hey, Officer? Motorcycle Cop: Sir, I'm going to need to see your license for that, um... SpongeBob: [laughs] You don't need a license to drive a bubble. Motorcycle Cop: Hmm, I suppose you're right. Carry on, citizen. [SpongeBob drives off with his bubble boat. The scene changes to SpongeBob coming home with his bubble boat. He enters his house and jumps in front of Gary, who is sleeping on his chair.] SpongeBob: Gary! Gary: [yowls] SpongeBob: You'll never believe it! I was out driving all day! Yes, driving! First, I drove down the street like this! [SpongeBob imitates his driving experience by floating around the house.] SpongeBob: Then I made a right turn on red like this. [SpongeBob imitates his right turn on red and floats around the living room. He lands on top of Gary.] SpongeBob: You should've been there, Gary! Oh, it was like a dream come true! Gary: [grumbling] Meow. [Gary goes back to sleep. SpongeBob hears a knock at the door.] SpongeBob: Hmm? [SpongeBob answers the door and sees various people.] Green Fish: I'm here for a bubble boat. Martin: Uh, yeah, me too! Dave: I want one! Various people: Uh, yeah, yeah, me too! Yes, please. One, please. SpongeBob: Oh, I'm not sure I have enough soap to make this many bubble boats. Green Fish: Please? SpongeBob: Well, I suppose I could tap into my rainy day reserves. [The scene changes to SpongeBob carrying a large bottle-full of bubble soap for everyone to have bubble boats. He pushes the bottle into the tub and fills it with soap. He kicks the bottle away. The green fish grunts in excitement. SpongeBob takes out his bubble wand from his mouth.] SpongeBob: One bubble boat coming right up! [SpongeBob dips his wand into the soap and blows the green fish a bubble boat.] Green Fish: Thank you! [The green fish drives off with his bubble boat.] Plankton: Down here, idiot! I want to strike fear in the hearts of other drivers. You got something terrifying in that wand for me, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: I sure do, Plankton! [SpongeBob dips his wand into the soap and blows Plankton a bubble boat that appears to be a killer robot. Plankton tries to get in, but he bounces off because the bubble is too big.] Plankton: Oof! [SpongeBob takes out a straw and sips the bubble boat down to Plankton's size. Plankton gets into his bubble boat.] Plankton: Ha-ha-ha, you fool! Now I will rule the streets! [cackles] [Plankton starts to drive his boat, but gets stepped on by Larry within seconds.] Plankton: Ouch! [SpongeBob looks on, disgusted, as Larry raises his foot, unsticking Plankton from his foot. Plankton, squished into a blob, crawls away.] Plankton: Strike fear... Larry: Hmm...blow me something that screams Larry, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: I'm on it, Larry! [SpongeBob pulls out a bigger wand, dips it in the soap, inhales and blows three huge bubbles until he shrivels. The three bubbles form into a bubble boat that has muscles like Larry.] Larry: Now, this is what I call a muscle car! [Larry jumps into his bubble boat as Tina drives by with her bubble boat.] Tina Fran: I love your boat, Larry! [Larry's bubble boat bulks up as they drive away. Just then, a huge line of people line up at SpongeBob's house.] SpongeBob: [sighs] I'll never blow enough bubble boats at this rate. Yahoo! [jumps into tub] [SpongeBob absorbs the bubble soap and blows a huge amount of bubble boats for everyone. The crowd cheers. Meanwhile at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, Mrs. Puff is preparing for class.] Mrs. Puff: [hums as she writes on the board] Greetings, class. My name is\u2014 [gasps] [No one is there.] Mrs. Puff: [startled stammer] Mrs. Puff. Oh, now that everyone's driving bubbles, they don't need licenses. [sighs] I guess there's just no place in this world for an old driving instructor. [Mrs. Puff puts her apple in her apples box. She drives away from her Boating School and drives into the street.] Mrs. Puff: Oh! Bah! Fred: Hey, watch it, lady! [Mrs. Puff swerves into a passing driver.] Mrs. Puff: Ah! Tom: I'm driving over here! [Mrs. Puff swerves into another passing driver.] Mable: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Mrs. Puff: Oh\u2014wah! [Mrs. Puff swerves into another passing driver.] Clay: Hey! Pick a lane, butter-brain! [A stoplight turns red as Mrs. Puff frantically tries to drive. As she drives, she runs through a stoplight, popping many bubble boats in the process. Just then, a motorcycle cop comes by on a bubble motorcycle.] Motorcycle Cop: I'm going to have to ask you to step out of the boat, ma'am. Do you know why I pulled you over? Mrs. Puff: You ran my plates and saw my rap sheet? Motorcycle Cop: What? No. Your vehicle has been outlawed, ma'am. [A truck driver tolls Mrs. Puff's boat with his bubble truck, throwing out her apples in the process.] Motorcycle Cop: Now that everyone drives bubble boats, real boats have been deemed too sharp and pointy to be street legal. [writes a ticket] Mrs. Puff: But I've never driven a bubble! [The motorcycle cop gives Mrs. Puff a ticket and leaves.] Mrs. Puff: Bubble boating school? [The scene changes to Mrs. Puff's Boating School now changed to Bubble Boating School. Mrs. Puff walks to the school, worried.] Mrs. Puff: Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. [opens door] Please don't be SpongeBob. [SpongeBob is seen at the desk.] SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [spins on the chair until he flies into the board] Hi, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: Of course. SpongeBob: You must be here for the bubble lessons. Don't worry, Mrs. P. [blows bubble] You'll be learning from a master. [SpongeBob bounces his bubble around. He puts his foot on it and pops it, making him fall over.] SpongeBob: Whoa! [belches out bubble and laughs] Mrs. Puff: Great. [The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff at the driving track in the bubble boat.] SpongeBob: Now, to get your bubble going, just pump your legs like this. [SpongeBob pumps his legs and makes the bubble boat move. He gives the steering wheel to Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff tries to do what SpongeBob did, but she loses her balance.] Mrs. Puff: Oh! Ooh! Oh! [Mrs. Puff inflates herself inside the bubble boat.] SpongeBob: Nice start. [The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff at the starting line again. Mrs. Puff pumps her legs and manages to control the bubble boat. She makes a left turn from the wall and turns where the safety cones are. SpongeBob is writing down her scores. Mrs. Puff avoids prickly cactuses. However, she did not notice the cactuses that are on fire.] Mrs. Puff: Oh! Fire! [Mrs. Puff makes the bubble boat run through the burning cactuses and swerves it into the school's lighthouse. The lighthouse is set on fire and firemen arrive in their bubble firetruck to put out the fire. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff at the starting line again. Mrs. Puff takes a deep breath and drives the bubble boat again. She goes over a hill, through a loop-de-loop hill, and drives past the flaming cactuses.] Mrs. Puff: Oh! Ah! Hmm. Hah. Eeh. [Mrs. Puff stops the bubble boat at the starting line.] Mrs. Puff: I did it. SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, you're ready. Mrs. Puff: Really? SpongeBob: Absolutely! You just need to pass your final test...out there. [points to people driving in their bubble boats] Mrs. Puff: [whimpering] Oh. [Mrs. Puff drives the bubble boat out of the boating school.] SpongeBob: Nice and easy. Doing great. [Mrs. Puff continues driving.] Harold: Hello! [Mrs. Puff waves to Harold.] Mrs. Puff: You know, this whole bubble boating thing isn't so bad. [laughs] Maybe I could\u2014 SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mrs. Puff! You got on the freeway by mistake! Look out! [Mrs. Puff frantically panics now that she is on the freeway.] SpongeBob: It's okay! Just calm down! [Mrs. Puff swerves the bubble boat to the left.] Mrs. Puff: Eeh! Oh! [A passing driver makes Mrs. Puff's bubble boat spin around. The bubble boat hits two other drivers and bounces off into another street. Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob are driving in a one-way street and almost get hit by other drivers.] Mrs. Puff: Ah! [SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff move around in the bubble boat in panic.] Mrs. Puff: Oh! [Mrs. Puff's bubble boat hits Nathiel Waters' bubble boat.] Mrs. Puff: Oh! [inflates herself and pops her bubble boat] [SpongeBob was sent flying into the ground. He pulls his head out of the sand.] SpongeBob: Ah! [Mrs. Puff's inflated body causes a pileup in the middle of the road. The bubble boats send Mrs. Puff and the other drivers flying to the surface.] SpongeBob: Oh no. What's gonna happen when they hit the surface? [The bubble boats reach the surface and they pop, sending everyone falling downward. SpongeBob quickly takes out his bubble soap and blows a lot of bubbles. SpongeBob's bubbles catches and saves everyone.] SpongeBob: Doh! [SpongeBob blows one last bubble to save Mrs. Puff.] Mrs. Puff: [wipes the soap off] No more bubbles. Get them off me! SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. Even though it was bubbles that caused all these problems, it was also bubbles that solved 'em. That's kind of a wash, I guess. Get it? Wash? Soap? Bubbles? [laughs] Motorcycle Cop: [takes bubble wand] Give me that! Bubble boats are too unstable. They've been declared illegal. Everyone back to your regular boats! [breaks the bubble wand and leaves] SpongeBob: Well, Mrs. Puff, looks like I have to get my boating license after all. See you tomorrow in class! \u266aLa-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la\u266a Mrs. Puff: [inflates herself] Oh, joy. [pops]",

  "transcript": "[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is outside in his boat on the street, waiting for SpongeBob.] Mr. Krabs: [growls impatiently and honks his horn] SpongeBob! [growls and honks his horn again] SpongeBob! SpongeBob: [appears on the passenger seat with a pilot helmet on] Oh, boy! Road trip! [fastens his seatbelt] I hope it lasts forever. [Mr. Krabs drives up to Old Man Jenkins' farm, which is only ten feet away from the Krusty Krab.] Mr. Krabs: And we're here. [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs head for the barn's entrance.] SpongeBob: Old Man Jenkins' farm? [The scarecrow starts to shake and Old Man Jenkins' appears from the shirt's opening.] Old Man Jenkins: Trespassers! [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs scream. Mr. Krabs hides in his shell and SpongeBob hides behind him. SpongeBob peaks his eyes out over Mr. Krabs' eyestalk holes. Old Man Jenkins comes out from scarecrow costume and points his pitchfork at Mr. Krabs' face.] Mr. Krabs: Whoa there, Jenkins! [Old Man Jenkins points his pitchfork further, but Mr. Krabs pushes it back] Pull in your plow! I'm here to pay me grocery bill. [holds up his really long bill] Jenkins here supplies all the Krusty Krab's farm fresh ingredients. SpongeBob: [as Mr. Krabs' bill extends itself] Ooh. [laughs] Yoo-hoo! Whee! [slides on the bill] Old Man Jenkins: And I expect to be paid for them. Mr. Krabs: Well, funny you should mention that. [SpongeBob comes up next to Old Man Jenkins in a farmer lady's outfit] SpongeBob here will be your farm hand until me bill's paid off. SpongeBob: Farm hand! Oh, boy! [rips off his outfit] Old Man Jenkins: Dagnabbit! If you think you can\u2014 [gets cut off by Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs: Oh, look at the time. Gotta go! Hey, boy-o! [hops into his boat] This should help you with your work! [throws out a sack and drives away] [The sack hits SpongeBob in the face and it skids him across the ground.] SpongeBob: Huh? Potatoes? [The sack opens and reveals Patrick eating all the potatoes.] Patrick: Pat-tatoes! [shows his mouth full of potatoes] SpongeBob: Oh, boy! We can be farming buddies. [hugs Patrick really tight, which makes him spit out the potatoes] Old Man Jenkins: Now hold on there, youngin'. I can't just let any dern fools work on my farm. SpongeBob: Oh, we're not just any dern fools. [SpongeBob and Patrick dig into their mouths and pull out their certified fools badges.] Patrick: We're certified fools. Old Man Jenkins: Hm\u2026.Well, better hitch up your britches. 'Cause we got tons of chores to get done before the big barn dance tonight! [Old Man Jenkins' farm and grain silo laugh and dance around. The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins leading SpongeBob and Patrick to the oyster coop.] SpongeBob: Oh, boy. What's first? Old Man Jenkins: First thing we do is gatherin' pearly eggs from this oyster coop here. The trick is getting them oysters to open up their clams. [rubs gently on the oyster's chin] Coochie coochie coo. [The oyster laughs and spits out an egg. Old Man Jenkins takes the egg and shows it to SpongeBob and Patrick.] SpongeBob: Ooh, shiny. Patrick: Ooh, aww. Old Man Jenkins: [puts egg in basket] I'll be back in two shakes of a lamprey's tail to see how you're coming along. [SpongeBob leans in to do the same trick as Old Man Jenkins did.] SpongeBob: [rubs gently on the oyster's chin] Uh, coochie coo-coochie\u2026 Oyster: [pouts] Uh-uh. SpongeBob: Okay, that didn't work. Patrick: SpongeBob, you gotta be more gentle. [Patrick grabs a crowbar and screams like a crazy maniac. He jumps over and sticks the crowbar in the oyster's mouth. Patrick tries to pry the oyster's mouth open with all his might, but the oyster flips Patrick over.] SpongeBob: Patrick! [Patrick whirls around in the air and lands on SpongeBob's face. The crowbar lands in Patrick's mouth and falls flat on the ground. SpongeBob's face is flattened and shaped like Patrick's buttocks before popping itself back in shape. The oysters laugh and spit eggs at SpongeBob and Patrick. Old Man Jenkins comes back and sees the basket still empty.] Old Man Jenkins: Why, you ain't gathered up a single egg! [SpongeBob comes over with his mouthful of eggs and spits them in the basket.] SpongeBob: Well, that was egg-citing. [laughs] [The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins, SpongeBob, and Patrick at the worm hog pen filled with worm hogs.] Old Man Jenkins: The next chore is to feed the worm hogs. [SpongeBob pours a bucket full of slop into the worm hog pen and rings the bell with his nose. The worm hogs run up and begin eating their food. Patrick is also eating the food with the worm hogs.] Patrick: [swallows the slop] Mmm. Slop. [One little worm hog is trying to eat some of the food and frantically looks for a place to dig in. But Patrick kicks the little worm hog away.] SpongeBob: Aww. Are you hingry-wungry cutie-wuite hoggy-woggy? [feeds some slop to the little worm hog and laughs] That tickles. [gasps as the little worm hog begins to swallow him whole] [SpongeBob screams frantically to break free, but the little worm hog spits SpongeBob out and completely swallows him up before belching out his clothes.] SpongeBob: Uh, could somebody hand me those? [Old Man Jenkins sighs in disgust. The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins, SpongeBob and Patrick with a cow-like jellyfish in the farm.] Old Man Jenkins: Now, you be gentle when you milk Ol' Bessy. [leaves as Ol' Bessy moos] SpongeBob: Don't you worry. I'll take it easy peasy on the old jelly squeezy. [SpongeBob grabs a bucket, pulls up a stool and attempts to milk jellyfish jelly from Ol' Bessy's udder. He grabs it and goes to milk it, but the udder sprays jelly on the floor. SpongeBob tries desperately to figure out how to milk it, but the udder keeps spraying jelly all over the place. SpongeBob, had enough with the udder, grabs it and goes to milk the jelly in the bucket. But the udder builds up so much jelly, that it causes Ol' Bessy to get angry and sprays jelly all around.] Old Man Jenkins: What in tarnation\u2014 [gets sprayed by Ol' Bessy's jelly] [Ol' Bessy gets really angry and throws a fit by kicking everything. She then kicks SpongeBob and Patrick and sends them flying towards Old Man Jenkins. All three of them crash into the farm's front door.] Patrick: Mmm, a Jenkin Jelly sandwich! [licks jelly off of Old Man Jenkins] [The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins giving SpongeBob and Patrick their final chore outside the farm. Patrick eats some of Ol' Bessy's jelly while Old Man Jenkins is talking.] Old Man Jenkins: Your final chore is harvesting my kelp patch. SpongeBob: [sees a tiny patch of kelp] Ha, this will be a snap. Old Man Jenkins: Not that patch. That one! [points to really huge field full of kelp] SpongeBob: [groans] That'll take forever! Old Man Jenkins: Not if you use my tractor. [points to his tractor] SpongeBob: But I don't have a tractor license. Patrick: I got lots of licenses. [shows off his licenses] Driver's license, fishing license, marriage license. Oh, here it is! Tractor license! [Patrick drives the tractor through the kelp patch. The tractor makes several bails of kelp from the back.] SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick. You're really good at this. Patrick: The secret is to stay cool as a sea cucumber. I don't want anything to distract\u2014 [shouts as he sees a jellybee flying over him] A bee! [screams] Jellybee! [babbles as he tries to shoo it away, but since there is no one steering the wheel, the tractor begins driving around uncontrollably] Get it off, get it off, get it off! [The tractor trips over a rock and flips around. The jellybee is now sitting on the tractor's steering wheel.] SpongeBob: Hold on, buddy. [grabs a rope from under the seat] I got it. [throws the rope] Hyah! [misses as it catches the steering wheel] Whoops. [the jellybee flies into SpongeBob's nose, but SpongeBob holds it closed so it won't fly out] Got it. Patrick: Yay! Don't let it go. [stupidly throws SpongeBob out] [SpongeBob lands on the ground and gets dragged around by the tractor.] SpongeBob: [spits out sand] Hey, this is fun. [The tractor continues to drive while making some kelp bails. SpongeBob skids across the field and dodges the kelp bails.] SpongeBob: [laughs while dodging the kelp bails] Whoo-hoo! [The jellybee flies out from one of SpongeBob's holes and stings him from behind. SpongeBob screams in pain and flips over to the front of the tractor in slow-motion. SpongeBob gets caught in the tractor's grinders and comes out all tied up.] SpongeBob: Did I \"bail\" out too soon? [laughs and breaks free] Oh, boy! Our chores are all done. It's time for the... SpongeBob and Patrick: Barn dance! [The tractor drives into Old Man Jenkins' farm and destroys it.] Old Man Jenkins: How can I have a barn dance with no barn? [sobs] SpongeBob: Don't you worry your little wrinkly head. 'Cause we're gonna have an old fashioned barn raising. [The scene changes to SpongeBob holding a barn baby as he rocks it. Patrick fills a baby bottle with nails and gives it to SpongeBob. SpongeBob feeds the barn baby the bottle of nails.] Patrick: Aww, wee, wee, wee. [gently rubs the barn baby's chin] Coochie coochie coo. [The barn baby belches out nails. SpongeBob and Patrick are now covered in nails, but it didn't hurt them.] SpongeBob and Patrick: Aww. [The scene changes to SpongeBob reading a book to the barn kid while Patrick paints red paint on its siding.] SpongeBob: [reading] \"'A' is for Amoeba. 'B' is for Blobfish.\" [The scene changes to SpongeBob, Patrick and the barn kid playing catch. The barn kid throws the ball at SpongeBob. SpongeBob throws it to Patrick. Patrick throws it back to the barn kid, but it misses as it crashes into the window of Old Man Jenkins' house.] Old Man Jenkins' house: Oh! You dang kids! [The scene changes to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins standing in front of a newly made farm.] SpongeBob: Congratulations on your barn-mitzvah. Today you are a man-barn. Patrick: Mazel tov! SpongeBob: [teary-eyed] Aw, they grow up so fast. [blows his nose] [The scene changes to nighttime. Old Man Jenkins' new farm is ready for the barn dance. SpongeBob turns on the flashlight and sticks it onto Ol' Bessy. Ol' Bessy moos happily and floats up to the ceiling. She then starts to spin around like a disco ball.] SpongeBob: Perfect! [Patrick is eating a bucket of worm hog slop] Hey, Patrick. You know what time it is? Patrick: [pulls his head out of the bucket] Time to put on my ham boots? [points to his feet standing on two hams] [One worm hog squeals and runs away.] SpongeBob: Nope! It's time to... [opens the front door] SpongeBob and Patrick: Partay! [sees no one there] Hmm? [The wind blows and a tumbleweed rolls by.] Patrick: Where is everybody? SpongeBob: When are your other guests coming, Old Man Jenkins? Old Man Jenkins: [spraying jelly out from Ol' Bessy's udder] Hmm? [wipes the jelly off his beard] What do you mean? This is the biggest turnout I've ever had! [Suddenly, the ground starts to shake. Outside the farm, a UFO comes flying over and looms downward. The hatch opens and the tractor beam shines down. An object comes out from the UFO, which turns out to be some kind of strange outhouse. The door opens and green smoke fumes. Then, a strange alien appears within the smoke.] SpongeBob: Oh, I think the party's over. [The alien looked like is was going to attack SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins. But as the smoke clears, the alien looks almost like a hill-billy farmer.] Farmer alien: Over? Why, it's just getting started. [pulls out a fiddle and plays music] [Then some more hill-billy farmer aliens come out and play their instruments. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins join in the fun and dance around with the farmer aliens. The tractor continues driving around the kelp patch as everyone dances.] SpongeBob: How did you guys know about the barn dance? Farmer alien: Well, we seen your invitation. SpongeBob: Invitation? What invitation? [The farmer alien activates his fiddle and a green glow surrounds it. SpongeBob, Patrick, Old Man Jenkins and the farmer alien are also surrounded in a green glow.] SpongeBob: Hmm? Wow. [SpongeBob, Patrick, Old Man Jenkins, and the farmer alien float upward where they can see the view of the farm.] Farmer alien: \"Barn dance and hoedown tonight. Aliens welcome.\" [points down to the strange pattern in the kelp patch created by the tractor] SpongeBob: Patrick, your crazy tractor driving invited them! Patrick: [shows off his crop circle license] I have a crop circle license too. [SpongeBob, Patrick, Old Man Jenkins, and the farmer alien float back down to the ground.] Farmer alien: Thank you kindly for inviting us, old timer. Well, we're off to destroy the universe. [pulls out a ray gun] Other farmer aliens: Yee-haw! [shoot their ray guns before heading back into their outhouse] Old Man Jenkins: [chuckles] Y'all come back and invade any time. SpongeBob: Annihilate safely. [The farmer aliens close their outhouse door and the UFO's tractor beam floats them back into their ship before flying away.] Farmer aliens: [as their UFO flies away] Yee-haw! [SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins wave good-bye to the farmer aliens just as Mr. Krabs pulls up in his boat.] Mr. Krabs: Hey-ho, Jenkins! Has SpongeBob worked off me bill yet? Old Man Jenkins: [rips the bill in pieces] You're all paid off, Krabs. [rubs SpongeBob's head] Now come back and visit anytime, SpongeBob. SpongeBob and Patrick: Bye, Old Man Jenkins! [SpongeBob and Patrick hop into Mr. Krabs' boat and they drive away from Old Man Jenkins' farm. SpongeBob is telling Mr. Krabs what they did while Patrick sleeps.] SpongeBob: Then we gathered pearly eggs, fed the worm hogs, milked Ol' Bessy, and then we met some nice space aliens. Mr. Krabs: Aliens? That's ridiculous. I think you've been working too hard, boy-o. Looks like you got farm stroke. You must have been hallucinating. There ain't no such thing as UFOs. SpongeBob: Gee, you think we just imagined it? Mr. Krabs: Yeah, probably\u2014 [screams as a tractor beam suddenly shines over them, shocked he was wrong] A UFO! SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, there is no such thing as aliens. [The tractor beam lifts the boat and abducts SpongeBob, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs. Then the UFO turns and flies away into the sky as the tractor drives by the Krusty Krab.]",

  "synopsis": "The episode begins with SpongeBob taking out the trash outside his house. He notices Mrs. Puff heading towards Squidward's house. SpongeBob greets her, to which she replies to get SpongeBob not to notice her. SpongeBob sees Plankton, Bubble Bass, and Incidental 154, to which they also try not be noticed. Squidward lets the four of them in and organizes a 'We Hate SpongeBob Club' meeting. They recite their motto and ask to share their painful memories with SpongeBob. Squidward hears SpongeBob and notices him outside his window, but tries to ignore him. Mrs. Puff asks to share her misfortune first, so Squidward gives her a \"speaking sponge.\"A flashback is shown with Mrs. Puff and her student Bertie Fitzpatrick. Bertie passes her driver's test and Mrs. Puff gives her a license. Bertie compliments her teaching skills, but SpongeBob soon shows up menacingly. He grabs Bertie's license and scratches it on his body. Bertie tries to take the license back, but is flung out of the boat. Mrs. Puff tries to escape from the boat, but SpongeBob takes control of the boat and drives crazily. SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff are flung back by a stop sign and they crash into the Boating School. As the flashback ends, Mrs. Puff cries and Squidward soon comforts her. SpongeBob attempts to enter Squidward's house again, but Incidental 154 kicks him out.Bubble Bass calls to share his moment next and asks for the sponge. A flashback at the Krusty Krab is shown, where SpongeBob delivers Bubble Bass's lunch order, featuring Krabby Patties, fries, and a hot dog. SpongeBob hopes Bubble Bass will enjoy his lunch, but takes away his fries and soda after he notices they are not perfect. SpongeBob then takes away a Krabby Patty and Bubble Bass chases him through the restaurant while SpongeBob continues noticing issues with his meal. Bubble Bass grabs the Krabby Patty off SpongeBob and eats it, but SpongeBob goes inside of him and gets the patty back after coming out of Bubble Bass's belly button. Bubble Bass runs out of the restaurant as the flashback ends.Plankton grabs a sponge to tell his story next. A flashback at the Chum Bucket is shown. Plankton works on an invention, which is shown to be toilet paper wrapped around dynamite. Plankton hears SpongeBob laughing, and he soon shows up in the Chum Bucket lab. SpongeBob takes control of Karen's mainframe, with Karen trying to get rid of him. SpongeBob causes a spill of chum, to which Plankton and Karen slip on, ending up locked outside the Chum Bucket. As the flashback ends, SpongeBob's laughter is heard, but Squidward is able to calm down his air conditioner.Squidward then tells his story with SpongeBob, taking place in real time. At that moment, Squidward opens his front door, to which no one is seen. However, SpongeBob shows up inside his house, asking for salt water. He greets everyone inside the house and learns of the club, but is unaware of the fact it's a vendetta against him and compliments on all the members. Patrick is also seen inside, drinking punch from a bowl. SpongeBob agrees to make pineapple punch using the walls of his house. As he comes back, he trips over Squidward, indirectly causing a fire inside his house. Everyone runs out, except SpongeBob and Squidward. While Squidward's house is being put out, SpongeBob offers for the rest of the meeting to be held at his house. SpongeBob volunteers to be the speaking sponge, to which Incidental 154 uses him as one. The episode ends with Squidward closing the meeting in the remains of his own home.",

  "transcript": "[The episode opens with a shot of SpongeBob's house. He opens the door, carrying a large bag of garbage.] SpongeBob: Oh, we had some good times, Trashy, but you're gonna love the dump! You'll make so many trashy new friends! [A bit of garbage leaks from the bag and drops on SpongeBob's nose. He laughs. SpongeBob extends his foot to hold up his trash can, then puts the bag inside and pulls his foot back in.] SpongeBob: [patting the bag] I'm gonna miss you! [suddenly notices something] Huh? [Mrs. Puff, in a brown coat, is walking towards Squidward's house.] SpongeBob: [waving] Hi, Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff: [in disguise] I'm not here! SpongeBob: Oops! [winks and points] My mistake. [Plankton, the mailman and Bubble Bass follow behind Mrs. Puff, also in brown coats and glasses.] SpongeBob: [waving] Hi, Plankton! Hi, Bubble Bass! [his nose turns into an extra hand, which he waves] Hi, Mr. Mailman! Plankton, Bubble Bass, and Mailman: [raising one hand] We're not here! SpongeBob: Hmm, maybe I need glasses. [takes off his eyes, blows on them, rubs them with his elbow, and then puts them back on his face] [Mrs. Puff knocks on Squidward's door. He peers through a gap in the door, then opens it and motions for everyone to come in. Inside Squidward's house, everyone is seated around a table. Squidward holds a gavel and has a bucket of sponges next to him.] Squidward: Fellow sponge sufferers, the 431st \"We Hate SpongeBob\" club will now come to order. [bangs the gavel] And now, our motto. Plankton, Bubble Bass, Mailman, Mrs. Puff, and Squidward: [raising one hand] We don't mean SpongeBob any harm. We just can't stand him. Squidward: Does anyone have any new sponge pain they would like to share? [The members stick their hands out, all talking over each other.] Mrs. Puff: How much time do you have? Plankton: I do! Bubble Bass: Oh, yes. I do. Mailman: I have to unwrap my package of pain! [Suddenly, SpongeBob is heard laughing.] Squidward: Huh? [the members retract their hands as Squidward motions for them to stop] Hold that agony. [looks to his right to see SpongeBob at the window] SpongeBob: Hello, Squidward! Squidward: [grunts, pulls the window blinds down, then faces the group] Proceed. Mrs. Puff: [clears her throat] I have some misfortune to share. Squidward: The chair recognizes Sufferer Puff. [grabs a sponge] Please receive the speaking sponge. [hands her the sponge] Mrs. Puff: [nervously kneading the sponge] It all began last week. [In Mrs. Puff's story, she and a young girl with braces drive through a colorful landscape of lollipops and rainbows.] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] I was enjoying one of my favorite things. [their car parks in front of Mrs. Puff's Boating School] Awarding a student their driver's license. [holds up a license] You've passed your driver's exam, Bertie! [Bertie is excited] Congratulations! [close-up on the license, which sparkles] Bertie: [takes the license] I couldn't have done it without you, Mrs. Puff! I bet you can teach anyone! Mrs. Puff: [blushes] Oh ho ho, aww! [The background turns orange and a shadow is cast as SpongeBob suddenly appears from the middle of the boat, laughing ominously.] Mrs. Puff: Almost anyone. [SpongeBob, with a grotesquely detailed face and hands, slides up to Bertie.] SpongeBob: Nice license. [getting closer] Can I touch it? [takes her license and rubs it on himself, laughing creepily. Bertie looks scared] Bertie: Eww, gross! [tries to take her license from SpongeBob, but he keeps holding on. Bertie grabs her license too hard and is flung backwards out of the boat, then screams and crashes offscreen] SpongeBob: Well, looks like you have an opening in your schedule, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: I tried to leave [the boat's doors lock] , but we all know there is [a purple spiral appears in her eyes over a swirling background] no escape from [SpongeBob morphs into a disturbing Rat Fink-style version of himself] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob laughs crazily, then sticks his foot through the boat and then speeds up the boat. The landscape is now dark and barren.] SpongeBob: Accelerate safely into traffic! [SpongeBob speeds and twists the road into a knot.] SpongeBob: [spins the steering wheel] Now for a 360 point turn! [The boat spins out of control, but hits a stop sign, causing the landscape to go back to normal.] SpongeBob: Oops! Almost ran a stop sign! [gets flung backwards by the stop sign] Whoaaa! Mrs. Puff: Whoaaa! [the boat hits the Boating School lighthouse] Aaaah! [the lighthouse tips over, causing the Boating School to explode] Mrs. Puff: [narrating] SpongeBob destroyed [fade back to her in Squidward's house, having twisted the sponge into a knot] my beautiful school! [tears the sponge] Just like last week! [cries, and Squidward puts a purple blanket over her] Squidward: It's okay. We're here for you. [holding up another sponge] Who would like to share next? SpongeBob: [sticking his head through the mail slot] I would! I'd like to share a hug! Mailman: [sticks a package in SpongeBob's mouth and kicks him] Looks like you could use a stamp! Bubble Bass: I believe that I am next in the roundelay. My speaking sponge, please? [Squidward holds one out. Bubble Bass looks displeased, but takes it anyways.] I was at the Krusty Krab [fades in to Bubble Bass sitting at a table in the Krusty Krab] to grab a light snack between first and second lunch. [SpongeBob walks up, holding a large plate of food.] SpongeBob: Order up, o valued customer! Bubble Bass: Ah. Finally. [puts on bib] Sustenance for my starving stomach! SpongeBob: [detailed close-up on his face] I hope it's perfect! [Bubble Bass is about to eat a fry, but then SpongeBob gasps as he grabs his arm.] Bubble Bass: Huh? [SpongeBob takes the fry away from him] SpongeBob: It's not perfect! [bends the fry, causing grease to splatter and hit Bubble Bass] It's too greasy! [Bubble Bass grabs another fry. SpongeBob jumps up and takes it.] SpongeBob: And this fry isn't greasy enough! [blows flour from it in Bubble Bass' face] Bubble Bass: Try as I might, [coughing] SpongeBob would not let me consume a single calorie! [drinking soda] I tried to take a sip of soda to slake my thirst! [SpongeBob gasps and pulls out a straw from one of his pores. He sticks the straw in Bubble Bass' mouth and sucks the soda out, then tastes it and swallows.] Not fizzy enough! [Bubble Bass squeezes the soda in frustration. He grabs a Krabby Patty.] Bubble Bass: That perforated pest wouldn't let me taste a morsel of Krabby Patty! [As Bubble Bass is about to bite into the Krabby Patty, SpongeBob grabs it. Bubble Bass bites his tongue and screams.] Bubble Bass: Give me back my patty, you festering fusspot! SpongeBob: [gasps] I can't! [He runs away, and Bubble Bass follows him.] The sesame seeds are misaligned! And the lettuce has too many wrinkles! The tomato has lost its sheen! Bubble Bass: Let me eat, you insufferable interrupter! [Bubble Bass jumps and lands on SpongeBob, then takes the Krabby Patty from him.] Bubble Bass: Victory is mine! [eats the patty and swallows, then laughs] SpongeBob: [weary noises, then his eyes bug out] Awooga! [SpongeBob jumps into Bubble Bass' mouth, struggling. Bubble Bass swallows him and smacks his lips.] Bubble Bass: A tad spongy, but not bad! [He holds up the Krabby Patty and is about to bite it, but his stomach rumbles.] That fry cook has given me a slight case of indigestion! [His stomach rumbles even louder. SpongeBob comes out of his belly button.] SpongeBob: [holding up Krabby Patty] I shall let no customer eat a less-than-perfect patty! [pats his head] Oh! [He reaches into Bubble Bass' belly button again and takes out his employee hat.] Ahh! [to Bubble Bass] I forgot my hat! [Bubble Bass runs out of the Krusty Krab, screaming. Fade to him in Squidward's house, eating the speaking sponge.] Bubble Bass: That squishy simpleton left my navel [close-up on Bubble Bass' knotted belly button, as a woman screams] in knots! Plankton: [taking a sponge from the box and dragging it to his seat] You call that suffering? I'll tell you a truly terrifying tale... [fade to the exterior of the Chum Bucket, on a stormy night] It was a dark and spongy night! [Plankton is seen, in silhouette, hitting something with a hammer.] Plankton: [narrating] I was working peacefully in my lab on my newest invention to... uh... help fishkind? Yeah, that's it. [throws the hammer away] Yes! My terrible [holds up a stick of dynamite with a roll of toilet paper around it] toilet paper will wipe Bikini Bottom off the face of the ocean! [laughs, then pats the toilet paper] Plus, it's quilted! [laughs, but is interrupted by SpongeBob's laughter.] [The lab's doors are seen swinging open.] Plankton: [shrugs] Eh. [evil laugh] [SpongeBob is heard laughing, along with some bubbling, as the scene cuts to a barrel of chum.] Plankton: Why does something always ruin a good evil laugh? [SpongeBob's laughter grows louder.] But then, I saw it! [A tall cylinder in the corner of the room tips over. SpongeBob appears from behind it, flying around like a bird and smashing into walls.] Plankton: [narrating] A wild SpongeBob had gotten in to my lab! SpongeBob: [bird calls] Plankton: [shouting] Karen! It got in again! [Karen appears, holding two brooms, through a laser-cut hole in the wall.] Karen: Did you leave the window open again? [SpongeBob crashes into the wall, then the floor. He jumps up to Karen's monitor, then squeezes inside.] Karen: [gasps] It's in my mainframe! [SpongeBob appears as a pixelated image on Karen's screen, then exits.] Karen: Oh, you dirty bird! Get down from there! [She swings the broom at him, but hits Plankton instead.] SpongeBob: [scared bird call] [Karen nearly hits him with the broom, and he flies off. Karen presses on Plankton.] Karen: Come on, lazy bones! Sweep it out the door! Plankton: [groans] [SpongeBob flies away, tipping over a barrel of chum. Karen and Plankton run at him with their brooms. They slip on the chum and end up outside the restaurant, falling in a puddle. The doors slam shut. SpongeBob laughs as Plankton tries to open the door.] Plankton: He's locked us out! [cries as SpongeBob keeps laughing, and lightning strikes] [In Squidward's living room, Plankton is punching a speaking sponge.] Plankton: So if you hear that horrible sound of a SpongeBob, just run! [the sponge falls over and crushes him] Ow! [muffled] Run for your lives! [SpongeBob's laughter is heard, as the group looks shocked. Squidward walks up to a square machine that resembles SpongeBob.] Squidward: Calm down. My AC is just acting up again. [hits the AC, causing it to stop making noise] Mrs. Puff: [fanning herself] Ooh, ooh! Plankton: Phew! Bubble Bass: Phew! Mailman: Thank Neptune! Squidward: You think you all have it bad? [takes sponge from basket] Wait until you hear my tale of spongy terror... [takes out clock] in real time. [his eyes turn into numbers] Three, two, one... [the doorbell rings] He had arrived! [Squidward opens the door. The group gasps. Nobody is outside.] Squidward: But there was no one there! Perhaps... it was nothing! Or was SpongeBob already in the house? [SpongeBob shows up holding a small measuring cup, his eyes spaced far apart. The lighting briefly goes dark.] SpongeBob: Could I borrow a cup of saltwater? Squidward: [sighs, then takes the cup and swishes it in the air, before thrusting it into SpongeBob's shirt] Here. [SpongeBob walks away] Of course, the saltwater was just a ruse to come inside uninvited. SpongeBob: [puts his arm around the mailman] Ooh! Are you having a party? Squidward: Naturally, SpongeBob lost no time annoying everyone in the room! SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff! I can't wait until my next lesson! Mrs. Puff: Ew... SpongeBob: Mailman, I gotta tell ya! Every package from you is a special delivery! Let's catch up soon, huh? Mailman: Uh... SpongeBob: Looking fit, Bubble Bass! [flexes] Been pumping the iron, huh? [picks up Plankton's chair and flicks his antenna] And Plankton, has anyone ever told you that you have the loveliest eye? Squidward: Of course, if SpongeBob was around, [camera pans to show Patrick standing behind Squidward] his pointy pink pal couldn't be far behind. [Patrick drinks a bowl of punch, including the ladle] Patrick: You're out of punch! [Squidward growls in anger.] SpongeBob: [walking to the door] Don't worry, Squidward! I'll mix up a batch of my special pineapple punch! [Squidward growls in anger, holding a sponge, then rushes towards him. SpongeBob is standing in the doorway.] SpongeBob: It's homemade! Made out of the walls of my home. [Camera pans to the exterior of SpongeBob's house, then back to him laughing. He shuts the door, and Squidward slams into it. He pops back out, onto the floor, with the speaking sponge falling into his hand.] Squidward: And no SpongeBob story would be complete without him destroying something! SpongeBob: [entering while holding a bowl] I've got pineapple puuu-- [trips over Squidward] Whoa! [The punch lands on the air conditioner, which short circuits and lights on fire. The club members run out of the house, screaming.] SpongeBob: Ooops. [walks away slowly] Squidward: [holds up sponge and drops it] The end. [Bubble transition to the next scene with firefighters putting out Squidward's burning house. The club members, SpongeBob, and Patrick stand outside, with Patrick still drinking punch.] Mrs. Puff: Where are we gonna finish our club meeting now? SpongeBob: [clears throat] I know a place you could have your meeting! [He gestures to his house. The club members groan.] [Bubble transition to the next scene with the members in SpongeBob's house, besides Squidward, sitting on his couch. Patrick sits on a chair, and SpongeBob brings in a plate of food.] SpongeBob: Who's ready for hors d'oeuvres? Watch out for the-- [Patrick takes the plate and devours its contents. The toothpicks stick out of his mouth.] SpongeBob: ...toothpicks. Bubble Bass: Phooey. [holds up empty basket] We're all out of speaking sponges. SpongeBob: [off-screen] Oh, no, you're not! There's one left! [Cut to a detailed close-up of SpongeBob posing. Sponge transition to him now being twisted by the mailman and laughing.] Mailman: And I was [coughs out letters] coughing up his mail for weeks! [coughs out more letters] [Pan to Squidward in the remains of his house, still sitting in his chair and holding a gavel.] Squidward: I declare this meeting of the We Hate SpongeBob Club... adjourned. Bang. [Squidward hits himself in the face with his gavel and collapses on the floor, ending the episode.]",

  "synopsis": "The episode starts off at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, everyone is bored hoping for the class to end while she is talking about steering and SpongeBob is taking notes in an exciting personality. When class ends, Mrs. Puff reminds the class that they are going on a field trip to the Bikini Bottom Museum of Boating tomorrow and the bus will pick them up at 8:00 AM. When SpongeBob realizes that this is finally his chance to impress Mrs. Puff and get his driver's license, he reads a 7,400-page book called The History of All Boating Ever.... When SpongeBob finishes the book at 7:59 AM on the next day, he ends up falling asleep when he realizes that tomorrow is today and he is going to be late for the bus.He races the bus once it leaves his house. Mrs. Puff, wanting to go without SpongeBob, tells Nat, the bus driver, to speed up. But SpongeBob suddenly comes in through the window. While SpongeBob begins talking to Mrs. Puff, she realizes SpongeBob's bad smell and gives him a bottle of Shower in a Can. SpongeBob then starts talking about the trivia of boating, which starts to give Mrs. Puff a headache. So, when the class finally arrives at the museum, SpongeBob is paying no attention as he is still talking about boating to Mrs. Puff, crashes into the front window and gets converted into a puddle outside the bus door, he then is back up again when he sees the museum in front of him.Mrs. Puff explains it was the largest boat ever that is now converted into a museum and can no longer be operated unless it goes to its yearly check at the port. Throughout the day, SpongeBob keeps interrupting Mrs. Puff to tell the students what she is about to say, much to her chagrin. Right when the class is about to leave, Mrs. Puff notices that SpongeBob has gone missing, but it turns out that he was in the driving room of the boat. He turns on the air conditioners on very high without noticing, which accidentally starts the boat.When Mrs. Puff finds SpongeBob as she comes back into the museum, she tries to stop the boat when she noticed it has been started, but she has never driven any boat so advanced before. So when she notices that the boat is going to crash into Bikini Bottom after SpongeBob turns the boat on Turbo Speed, SpongeBob tries to stop the boat by battening down the hatches, lowering the anchor, uttering a hearty seaman's laugh, and doing the reverse 720 tailspin. And right when the boat is about to destroy Bikini Bottom, it stops, only tapping the first building. When Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob leave the boat, Mrs. Puff gives SpongeBob his driver's license due to her impression.However, she is outraged when she finds out that the museum owner was simply taking the boat into Bikini Bottom for a checkup at the port and that he was doing all of the driving. As a result she angrily tears up SpongeBob's driver's license, leaving the latter heartbroken. The museum owner then suggests that they should go get some ice cream to cheer SpongeBob up while he had the pin of becoming an Honorary Sea Legs as his bright side. When the three are about to go have ice cream, SpongeBob notices that the headlights of the boat are still on. As he runs back inside, the museum owner and Mrs. Puff try to tell SpongeBob to not touch anything, but the latter didn't listen and he flips the boat on its opposite side as Mrs. Puff inflates once again, ending the episode.",

  "transcript": "[Episode begins at Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Mrs. Puff is teaching her students.] Mrs. Puff: Remember, class, there's only one way to park a boat: the safe way. You now see the importance of proper steering and a properly calibrated anchor... [SpongeBob writes it down and puts the paper inside his head] ...which brings us to the subject of rudder maintenance. [bell rings. Everyone runs outside except SpongeBob] SpongeBob: Barnacles! Just as we were getting to the nitty-gritty! Mrs. Puff: Wait a minute, class! [everyone stops and bumps into each other then Jimmy Gus hits the back of the line the hardest and the first fish in line falls out the door] Remember, we will not be here tomorrow. We will be going on a field trip to the Boating Museum. Now run along, kids. [they all run out and Mrs. Puff goes to her desk] SpongeBob: Wow, the Boating Museum! Maybe tomorrow if I can impress Mrs. Puff with an extensive knowledge of boating history, she'll give me a boating license on the spot! [starts laughing and \"drives\" his chair out the door and makes boating noises] See you tomorrow, Mrs. P.! [starts laughing again] Mrs. Puff: Neptune, give me strength! [Setting goes to SpongeBob at his house at night in his library.] SpongeBob: Let's see. Ah, there she is. Whoa! [finds his boating history book and falls on the ground with the book and Gary meows] What is this, Gary? Why, it's the complete history of all boating ever and I'm going to memorize it tonight for the big field trip tomorrow. [Gary meows again] I'm perfectly capable of reading 7,400 pages and still getting my required eight hours of sleep before the bus picks me up at promptly at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get started. [Gary moves away] All right, let's see what this little pamphlet is all about. [starts reading] \"Chapter 1: In the beginning, Neptune created the sail.\" French Narrator: 7:59 a.m. SpongeBob: \"...but such tragedies will be avoided with the flying boat of the future. The end.\" [looks really exhausted from reading 7,400 pages] Time for a little shuteye before... [the camera focuses on a closeup of his bloodshot eyes with boogers, and he closes his eyes, but then his alarm rings. He opens them] Oh, Mrs. Puff, can't this wait till tomorrow? [closes his eyes again then also opens them] Hang on a minute, it is tomorrow! [runs out his door and sees the bus and runs for it] Hey, wait! Hey! Mrs. Puff! Please stop the bus! [sees Mrs. Puff through the window and knocks] Bus Driver: What was that? Mrs. Puff: Nothing, uhh, just keep driving. [SpongeBob knocks on the window again] Step on it! [The bus driver puts the pedal to metal.] SpongeBob: Wait! Mrs. Puff: Phew. [SpongeBob's face is on the window, Mrs. Puff screams and he gets inside] SpongeBob: No worries, I made it. Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, you look terrible. [SpongeBob\u2019s face looks exhausting] SpongeBob: I assure you, I am well rested and ready to learn. Who knows, Mrs. Puff? Before the day is out you may have learned something yourself. [Mrs. Puff smells SpongeBob's odor, sprays \"Shower in a Can\" on him and he smells better] Hey, Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: Yes, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: I made this for you. Mrs. Puff: Made what? SpongeBob: [holds out a model of a tiny boat] This, the H.M.S. Pinafore, at 1 to 8,427 scale of course. Mrs. Puff: Thank you, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: Yes, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Do you know how many rowers it takes to propel a trireme? Mrs. Puff: Well, that would be... SpongeBob: Do you know which boat is fastest on record? Mrs. Puff: Wasn't that the... SpongeBob: Did you know in the future that all boats will be powered by dolphin manure? [screen zooms in to SpongeBob] Did you know that the H.M.S. Bluetoes was originally a racing boat before it became the royal family's private yacht? Do you know what scuttling is? What's bigger, a flotilla or a fleet? Did you know... [time passes] Ever been on a... [the bus stops at the museum and SpongeBob flies to the windshield] Bus Driver: We're here. [SpongeBob goes out the door and notices the Boating Museum] Mrs. Puff: Welcome, class, to the Boating Museum. This enormous vessel was once the largest in all the seas, but now that has been converted into a museum, it no longer moves. SpongeBob: Actually, it gets taken to port once a year for maintenance. Mrs. Puff: If you don't mind, SpongeBob, I'll be doing the teaching today. SpongeBob: No problemo, Mrs. P. [Mrs. Puff and the rest enter the museum with a room with many boats] Mrs. Puff: Here it is, class. The most extensive collection of seafaring history ever assembled, from giant naval vessels to more modest craft like this clamming boat. SpongeBob: I'd say this baby can hold up to... ten clam fishers. Mrs. Puff: Uh, sure, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Why, I bet they reel in up to 50 clams a day. Mrs. Puff: Moving along. [they go to a big boat] Over here we have the Sandy Nub. It was a cargo ship used to bring back exotic spices from faraway lands. SpongeBob: [laughs] With two direct-action steam turbines producing 6,500 horsepower geared up to triple screws, [snaps his fingers] it'll get your spices where they need to go. Mrs. Puff: [in a mad voice] Thank you again, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: It's working! She's noticing my vast of knowledge! I can now taste the sweet, sweet lamination of a fresh boating license. [Setting goes to another big boat.] Mrs. Puff: This, class, is the Lady Scallion. SpongeBob: ...named after the captain's strict diet of scallions, of which the crew complained and the captain's [makes a P.U. sign] odor strongly resembled. [the kids start taking pictures of him] For four years this brigantine explored distant lands discovering places unknown to anyone besides the people [Mrs. Puff expresses a furious face] who already lived there. [She growls. SpongeBob taps on Mrs. Puff] You ready to give me that license yet, Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: [angry voice] Oh, you're going to get it all right. SpongeBob: [squeals] I knew it! [They go to more places while SpongeBob informs the class and Mrs. Puff doesn't get a chance. They go to a boat and Mrs. Puff tells them about it, but is interrupted by SpongeBob, who is looking through a telescope at the top. The kids cheer, Mrs. Puff makes an angry face. After the montage, they then walk out of the museum.] Mrs. Puff: Okay, this is the end of the tour. Anything to add, SpongeBob? [doesn't see him] SpongeBob? SpongeBob: [turns his chair around inside the museum still] Oh boy, here it is! The main controls! Just look at all this stuff! There's the triple oscillator, and there's the hoist pulley, and there's the booby trap, and there's the long range mast knob, and there's a hot dog with extra mustard. [gasps] And there is the starter mechanism. That, right there. [points at the Air Conditioner button] A/C, hmmm...That's short for \"automatic conditionata,\" and that's fancy fancy talk for \"Let's get this party started. Like, instantly!\" [presses A/C button, the fast air moves towards SpongeBob, who pushes the vent to the left] Tartar sauce..! Whew. [the fast air turns the boat on and an alarm occurs and gears and engines move then the boat moves] Man, I'm glad that's over. Oh, that's a nice touch, what a soothing projection screen. [glass ticks and SpongeBob looks behind] Mrs. Puff: That's not a projection screen! [runs towards SpongeBob and sits on his lap] SpongeBob, stop it right now! SpongeBob: Yes, ma\u2019am. [turns the turbo speed on then boat goes faster] Mrs. Puff: Oh, sweet Poseidon. Move aside. [pushes SpongeBob away] I gotta stop this ship before it plows into Bikini Bottom! Uh, uh, let's see. The first thing to turn off is the... Uh, oh, dear Neptune! I've never driven anything this advanced before. [pulls SpongeBob back] SpongeBob, I hope you know what you were talking about, because it's up to you now. SpongeBob: Okay. [tries the steering wheel] Mrs. Puff: We don't have much time. In a few minutes, we'll be flattening millions of innocent lives! SpongeBob: Innocent lives?! Mrs. Puff: And you're the only one that can save them. SpongeBob: The only one...that can...save...them?! Mrs. Puff: Yes! And what I want you to do [SpongeBob's face turns into a frown] is ummm, tighten the gurneys, then survey the poop deck, and... SpongeBob: Stop! I know what to do. [pulls out a pirate hat and puts it onto his head] I read a book. Chapter 1, batten down the hatches. [all doors and windows were shut] Next, lower anchor. [the anchor lowers down, but gets stuck on railings] Oh no! [as screen shakes] The anchor is stuck. I\u2019m going to free it manually. I'll be right back. [jumps out of the control center, flies towards the anchor and pulls the anchor with a horse gallop sound and when anchor is free, he swings back and cuts to the control center] Done and done. Thirdly, utter a hearty seaman's laugh. [laughs like a pirate but harsher] Mrs. Puff: Oh, my gravy. He even knows the hearty laugh! He has been doing his homework! SpongeBob: [still laughs] And finally, the coup de grace. The only way to park the largest ship ever built, [zooms to SpongeBob's face] is by performing the Reverse 720 Tailspin. Mrs. Puff: [gasps] But that's never been attempted before! SpongeBob: You're right, it hasn't. [says sentence with a surprise] Not until now! [the ship spins and does a backflip and spins again then returns to it's position. Cuts to a scene where Bikini Bottom is shown in the ship's windshield and stops with a tiny crash on an apartment and both SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff sighs] Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I don't know how, [her face turns into a smile] but you did it. You saved us all. Let's get off this thing. [Cut into a scene where they get off the ship] And the way you pulled the anchor out, genius! I never thought I'd say this, but here's your driver's license. [SpongeBob screams and slowly grabs the license] SpongeBob: Oh, boy! At long last! Tugboat driver: What are you doing here? [SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff look] No one should be on board while I\u2019m tugging the museum into port. Mrs. Puff: You mean, he's not driving this thing at all? Tugboat driver: Heck, no! [Mrs. Puff rips the license, SpongeBob saddens and pulls off the hat, looking at it; to SpongeBob] Now, don't get so down, kid! Look, for your false bravery, I\u2019m giving your honorary Sea Legs, okay? Come on, let me buy you an ice cream. [the boat alarms softly which cuts to the scene where the headlights are on] SpongeBob: Oh, gosh. [chuckles] Headlights are on! [runs back into the ship] Mrs. Puff & Tugboat driver: Don't touch anything, you twit! [SpongeBob gets back on the boat] Tugboat driver: Run! [The ship flips sideways] Mrs. Puff: [inflates then turn to SpongeBob who pops up beside her] Good thing you studied. [Episode ends]",

  "synopsis": "The episode begins with Sandy calling Mrs. Puff and Karen to tell them that she had lived as an amoeba for a week, and because of that, she wants to celebrate by having a night out with them. They meet at a caf\u00e9 and have fun, until Mrs. Puff and Karen talk about how SpongeBob and Plankton respectively are extremely annoying to them. This prompts the three of them to prank the two.They first prank Plankton into thinking Mr. Krabs is giving him the formula by using a disguise. When Plankton is fooled, he goes to the Krusty Krab to obtain the formula. However, this causes an alarm at the Krusty Krab to sound off and the real Mr. Krabs arrives at the restaurant. The two take out their weapons and start fighting each other, while the three girls laugh outside the Krusty Krab.The girls prank SpongeBob next by putting on a virtual reality helmet on him which makes him think he got his driver's license and gets to ride a free boat, despite actually being a shopping cart. The prank starts off well, but when Mrs. Puff gets too crazy about it and smashes the cart with SpongeBob in it, he starts riding off into Bikini Bottom. The three chase SpongeBob until they crash into a dead end and land onto the ground.Mrs. Puff takes the helmet off SpongeBob who realizes that he has been pranked. However, since he loves pranks, he puts the headset back on and continues to \"drive,\" but in midair. The girls turn into amoebas to relax, only for SpongeBob, Plankton and Mr. Krabs to arrive. In doing so, they ruin their relaxation as SpongeBob begins to steamroll through while the two other men continue their feud, as the episode ends.",

  "transcript": "[The episode begins with Sandy rounding up capturing some bacteria in her amoeba form.] Sandy: [laughs] Yee-haw! Get along, little amoebas! [checks her watch] I did it! It's sarsaparilla time! [jumps out from her microscope, pushes the exit button and reverts back to her normal form] Holy osmosis! I lived as an amoeba for a whole week! [Sandy jumps off her table, takes a vial and pours it on a speck, which forms into a telephone. Sandy dials the number and calls Karen at the Chum Bucket.] Plankton: [crushing a remote] Can't get it to work, can never get it to work! [yells indistinctly in the background] Karen: [answers the phone] Hello? Sandy: [pushes the screen to make room] Karen, my Mainframe! I just made a scientific breakthrough. Let's go and celebrate, girl! Karen: I'm sorry, Sandy. I can't hear you because [turns to Plankton] someone can't shut up! [Plankton stops yelling.] Sandy: That's okay, Karen. I'll tell you all about it later. Let's meet up tonight at the corner caf\u00e9! Karen: You got it, Bushy Tushy. I will definitely be there. [Sandy hangs up the phone] Okay, I'm off. Plankton: Those are not my test tubes! [kicks some test tubes] Karen: Ugh. Don't wait up. Plankton: I don't know where they came from! [throws some more test tubes] [The scene changes to SpongeBob, who is once again trying to pass his boating exam with Mrs. Puff at her boating school.] SpongeBob: [mutters excitedly] Whoa! Mrs. Puff: [sighs] Don't forget to signal. SpongeBob: [gets up and waves his arms] Oh, thanks for that, Mrs. Puff, I\u2014 [crashes into the wall and Mrs. Puff puffs up] [Mrs. Puff deflates and her cellphone rings.] Mrs. Puff: [answers her cellphone] Hello? Sandy: [pushes the screen to make room] Howdy, Powder Puff! You wanna step out with me and Karen tonight? Mrs. Puff: Oh, yes, Sandy! I desperately need to step out. [laughs and exits her boat] SpongeBob: Ooh! You're talking to Sandy? Mrs. Puff, tell her I said, \"Hi!\" Tell her I said, \"Hi!\" Tell her I said, \"Hi!\" Sandy: We'll all meet up at the corner caf\u00e9 tonight. Get ready to party, y'all! Mrs. Puff: Okay! See you soon! SpongeBob: Tell her I said, \"Hi!\" Sandy: [hangs up the phone and pulls the screen back up] Whoo. SpongeBob: Tell her I said, \"Hi!\" [Mrs. Puff exits the boating school and locks the gate. She hums as she walks until SpongeBob shows up.] SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff! Tell her I said, \"Hi!\" [Mrs. Puff frantically runs away from SpongeBob. The scene changes to Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff drinking hot chocolate at the corner caf\u00e9 at night.] Sandy: [gives Mrs. Puff and Karen a toast of their friendship] Yeah! [Mrs. Puff and Karen get whipped cream on their faces and sigh. Sandy gets whipped cream on her face as well. But she sneezes it onto her helmet.] Sandy: [licks the whipped cream] Y'all are never gonna believe what I did this week. It's about as crazy as a mule with a top hat! Mrs. Puff: Was it crazier than this? [imitating SpongeBob] \"Tell Sandy I said 'Hi!'\" \"Tell Sandy I said 'Hi!'\" [mimics SpongeBob's laugh and falls over] Sandy: Sorry your day was tough, Puff. But my news will cheer your head off. I lived as a microscopic organism for a whole week! Karen: That's great, Sandy, but I've lived with a microscopic organism for 26 years and wait until you hear what that pipsqueak did today. He leaves his little telescope on the floor, [smacks Mrs. Puff by accident as she talks] I rolled over it. It hurt like heck! And then, he gets mad at me for breaking it. Doesn't even ask if my wheel's okay. [picks up her wheels to show that one of them is broken] Mrs. Puff: [gets up] SpongeBob is the same way, Karen. After all these years of my trying to teach him how to drive, he doesn't know the first thing about a car! [pounds on the table] I'm going crazy! [Both Karen and Mrs. Puff cry their tears off. Karen\u2019s screen visualizes a scenic waterfall, with her tears running down in real time from where the waterfall is on screen] Sandy: Hey, hey, hey, hey. We're supposed to be having a good 'ol time, not a good 'ol cry. Mrs. Puff: [sniffs and stops crying, with her mascara running down her face] I'm having a good time. Karen: [stops crying, Karen\u2019s screen visualizes an industrial valve being turned off] Me too. Sandy: Look, guys. This is a girls night out. And I'm gonna make sure we have more fun than three rats in a pickle barrel! [Karen and Mrs. Puff join hands with Sandy] Gal pals unite! Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen: Yeah! Karen: [her screen shows \"Gal Pals\" on it] Gal pals! [The scene changes to the Chum Bucket. Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen are hiding in the dumpster.] Karen: So, let me get this straight. Pranking Plankton will make me feel better? Sandy: You bet your sweet software it will. Now let's get pranking. [Sandy and Mrs. Puff dress up in a poorly made costume of Mr. Krabs. They come out of the dumpster, but the costume is making them lose their balance. Karen places the costume's head on them, takes out her microphone and imitates herself as Mr. Krabs.] Karen: [imitating Mr. Krabs via microphone] Money, money, money, money, money, money, money. [Sandy and Mrs. Puff step up to the front door.] Sandy: Ready? [throws a rock] Yah! [The rock smashes through the window and hits Plankton.] Plankton: Ouch! [peaks out the window and sees Mrs. Puff and Sandy in their disguise] Krabs?! If I wasn't on probation, I'd call the cops! Karen: [imitating Mr. Krabs via microphone] Plank-ter-ren, me old nemesis-ser! [Sandy and Mrs. Puff's balloon eye on their disguise deflates, but they quickly fix it] I've got good news-erer: I'm leaving town and going back into the \"Navery,\" so I'm giving you me secret formuler-er-rer! [the disguise's arm falls off] Plankton: What? How do I know this isn't a trap-erer? Ah! You got me doing it! Karen: [imitating Mr. Krabs via microphone] It's a going away gift-erer. [Sandy and Mrs. Puff fall backwards and almost expose themselves. Karen slaps herself in embarrassment.] Karen: [imitating Mr. Krabs via microphone] I'll get me formuler-er out of me safe-er-er-er and meet you at the Krusty Krab-er-er-er. [Plankton's thought cloud shows Mr. Krabs giving Plankton the secret formula.] Plankton: I'll meet you there, Eugene honey! [blow kisses] Kiss! [giggles] Sandy: I think he bought it. Karen: Psst! Come on! Sandy and Mrs. Puff: Whoa-whoa! Wa-whoa! Whoa! [fall in the dumpster] [Plankton comes out of the Chum Bucket, humming happily. Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen giggle as Plankton enters the Krusty Krab.] Plankton: I'm here! [hums as he heads to the office where the formula is] [Just then, the alarm goes off and the real Mr. Krabs arrives.] Mr. Krabs: Plankton! You've interrupted me beauty sleep! Plankton: Hey, Eugene. I'll just take the secret formuler-erer heh and be on my way. Mr. Krabs: [pulls out a cannon] Over my dead body! Plankton: [pulls out a ray gun] Whatever you say, Welcher! [Mr. Krabs and Plankton begin a brawl inside the Krusty Krab. Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen laugh together.] Karen: Y'know, you're right, Sandy. I do feel so much better! [shows the word \"Gal Pals\" on her screen] Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen: Gal pals! [Mr. Krabs blasts Plankton out of the Krusty Krab and sends him flying off into the distance. The scene changes to Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen outside of SpongeBob's house.] Mrs. Puff: I'm not so sure about pranking SpongeBob. He can't help he's insufferable. Sandy: Nobody likes a good prank more than SpongeBob. Mrs. Puff: Mm. Okay. [Mrs. Puff takes out a ruler and unlocks the door. Sandy and Mrs. Puff sneak into SpongeBob's house while Karen stand outside as a look-out. Sandy and Mrs. Puff come back out with SpongeBob sleep on his bed's mattress. SpongeBob slides off the mattress and continues sleeping. Sandy then quietly slips a helmet on his head.] Sandy: Virtual reality helmet, engaged. [SpongeBob murmurs in his sleep and the girls laugh at him.] Sandy: Shh, shh. All right, Karen. You're up. [Karen turns on her screen and makes the sound of a doorbell ringing.] SpongeBob: [wakes up] Huh? C-coming! [SpongeBob sees through the virtual reality helmet as sees his house. He walks up to Sandy and turns her as if he's opening the door. Then he sees Mrs. Puff as Norton.] SpongeBob: Hello? Can I help you? Mrs. Puff: [via Norton] Hello, Mr. SpongeBob. I'm just here to deliver your driver's license. [gives SpongeBob a card in order to fool him into thinking it's his driver's license] Congratulations. SpongeBob: Oh, uh, thanks\u2014 [gasps] My driver's license! [his \"license\" winks at him] Mrs. Puff: [via Norton] And your new boat! [shows SpongeBob a shopping in order to fool him into thinking it's his boatmobile] SpongeBob: My new boat! [jumps in his shopping cart] Whoa, wow! [mutters excitedly] Am I dreaming? [sees flying pineapples and a Pteranodon through the helmet] Nope, it's for real. [Sandy and Mrs. Puff shake the shopping cart to fool SpongeBob into thinking he's driving; Through the helmet, he sees bystanders waving at him. Including a talking banana] Look at me, everyone! I'm driving! I'm driving! Mrs. Puff: [shudders] Oh! That voice. Yes, you're driving! You're driving me crazy! [gasps and laughs maliciously] I know! Let's make the road really bumpy! [Mrs. Puff lifts up the shopping cart and crashes it back and forth while losing her sanity.] SpongeBob: Wha-what? Whoa! [falls down] Whoa! Ow! [Mrs. Puff murmurs angrily] Hm, those are some potholes. [Mrs. Puff breathes heavily from her insanity.] Sandy: Whoa, girl! Easy there. Maybe it's about time we let SpongeBob in on the joke. Mrs. Puff: [punches herself and calmly regains her sanity] Okay. I'll tell him. SpongeBob\u2014 [notices SpongeBob driving away] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob laughs as he drives away in the shopping cart. Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen scream and chase after SpongeBob. SpongeBob runs over a rock, spins and continues to drive. Sandy and Mrs. Puff ride onto Karen.] Mrs. Puff: Poor little guy! This is all my fault! Sandy: No, Puff! This is all my fault! Karen: [her screen shows \"Gal Pals\" on it] Gal pals! Sandy: Not now, Karen! Karen: Sorry. SpongeBob: [laughs and sees a crowd cheering for him through the helmet] Ooh, a turn. Better use my hand signals. Sandy: SpongeBob! Look out! [SpongeBob grabs onto a one way sign and swings the shopping cart the other direction. Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen continue to follow him. As SpongeBob drives the shopping cart, he causes a major pile up on the road.] SpongeBob: [laughs] Hi, I'm driving. Hi, I'm driving. Hi, I'm driving! [laughs and waves the card around] Look, I got a license. [two boats collide and Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff emerge from the smoke; SpongeBob giggles] Whoo! Nothing but me and miles of road! [giggles as he is ending to a brick wall near a construction site] Sandy: We gotta stop this cart, gal pals! [The background changes into red, orange, and yellow sunlights. Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen reach SpongeBob and grab onto the shopping cart.] Mrs. Puff: Whoa! Whoa! [sees the brick wall saying the words, \"Dead End\"] I'll save you, SpongeBob! [Mrs. Puff jumps onto SpongeBob and the shopping cart loses control. They crash through the brick wall and the all descend down into the construction site.] SpongeBob: Now I'm flying! [sees clouds through the helmet] Whee! [Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff fall into the shopping cart as it hits the ground. Mrs. Puff inflates herself and SpongeBob lands safely on her. Mrs. Puff deflates her body.] SpongeBob: Huh? Huh? Huh. [sees the cloud through the helmet and Mrs. Puff takes it off of his head] Huh? [Mrs. Puff laughs sheepishly] Mrs. Puff? Oh, I see. You guys played a prank on me, huh? I love pranks! [laughs] Thank you, thank you, thank you! You gave me a chance to live my driving dream. And most importantly... [hugs Mrs. Puff] Mrs. Puff saved my life! Now I will stay by your side forever! [laughs] Mrs. Puff: Oh, no! No! [SpongeBob flies around Mrs. Puff. Sandy grabs Mrs. Puff and the hop back onto Karen. They all run away from SpongeBob.] SpongeBob: Huh? Oh, you girls got me again! [laughs, puts the helmet back on and moves around in midair] Vroom! Vroom! Sandy: I know somewhere where we can finish our ladies night in peace. [The scene changes to Sandy's treedome where Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen are seen as amoebas.] Karen: [laughs] Good one. [laughs] This was a great idea, Sandy. Mrs. Puff: Yeah, what a nice place to relax. [Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen drink their hot chocolate and get whipped cream on their faces. They like off the whipped cream and sigh. All of a sudden, SpongeBob comes in as an amoeba.] SpongeBob: Vroom, vroom! Honk, honk! Beep, beep! Oh, look at me, Mrs. Puff! I'm driving! [laughs] [Then Plankton and Mr. Krabs come in as amoebas continuing their brawl over the Krabby Patty secret formula.] Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen: [sighs] Men. [Karen shows her screen \"Gal Pals\" on it through the microscope lens] Gal pals!",

  "synopsis": "One morning, SpongeBob wakes up to find out that Gary is missing and soon discovers that he is the only one left in all of Bikini Bottom. At first, he finds this hard to take. In a panic, he runs around town in a desperate attempt to find anyone, but to no avail.When the others do not return, SpongeBob decides to live out everyone's lives for them. He makes a bubble version of himself in his front yard, then runs to the top floor of Squidward's house, pretending to be Squidward yelling at SpongeBob for making too much noise. The latter then runs to the Krusty Krab, imitating Squidward and Mr. Krabs. He then imitates Patrick in his rock and Sandy at her treedome before running to the boating school and imitating Mrs. Puff.While in the classroom, he realizes that living out everyone's lives will not work and breaks down crying on his desk. SpongeBob's mood quickly changes when he discovers a stack of blank driver's licenses. He takes a picture of himself and prints out his own license. He then takes off with the student test boat, naming it \"Boaty,\" and joyriding throughout the city.SpongeBob and Boaty become inseparable best friends. The latter sleeps with the boat and parks it inside both his house and the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is going insane without people to talk to, and Boaty realizes this. In his closet, SpongeBob has erected a puppet of Patrick out of raw Krabby Patty meat, which he carries out a conversation with. The \"Patty-Patrick\" warns him that he cannot talk because Boaty is listening. He goes crazy from the sight of any motor vehicle, and when a bus comes, he grabs a fire axe from the cinema to chop at the bus that approaches him.To his surprise, everyone in Bikini Bottom comes out of it. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob that everyone's mysterious disappearance was really a holiday to celebrate being away from the latter for a day called National No SpongeBob Day. Before venturing off, a giant effigy of SpongeBob is erected, and then burned. Everyone then dances on the ashes to celebrate. SpongeBob is deeply saddened, not because of the holiday but that everyone was gone for so long, but Mr. Krabs tells him that the holiday is an honor, and SpongeBob feels appreciated.Patrick tells SpongeBob that the holiday is nothing compared to \"No Patrick Day.\" After Patrick says this, everyone decides to celebrate National No Patrick Day and boards the bus except for Patrick, who is stopped by SpongeBob. The second everyone leaves, Patrick sadly wonders where they went, obviously forgetting what he just said as the episode closes.",

  "transcript": "[The episode starts at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is sleeping, and his alarm clock wakes him up, he struggles to turn it off, yawns, then gets out of bed, puts his pants on, then walks into the kitchen to get food for Gary, he accidentally trips because of the heavy bag of food, and there's a big pile of food on top of Gary's bowl.] SpongeBob: Gary, come and get it! [Gary doesn't come to get the food. Outside SpongeBob's pineapple, the wind is blowing and Bikini Bottom looks completely empty] Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary!? [SpongeBob looks in the living room, at the top of the staircase, out of a door at the bottom of the staircase, under his bed, and in the toilet, SpongeBob then walks back into the kitchen] Gary must have gotten an early start. [walks away] [The scene cuts to outside where SpongeBob is walking up to Squidward's house with a megaphone.] SpongeBob: Rise and shine, Squidward! You don't wanna be late again. [silence] Okay, see you at the Krusty Krab. [now talking to himself] I guess Squidward needs his beauty sleep. Not everyone is blessed with my natural good looks. [The scene cuts to Patrick's house. SpongeBob knocks on it.] SpongeBob: Patrick, it's morning! You don't want to forget to wake up again. [silence again] Patrick? Okay, see you after work, sleepy head. [Cut to scene of SpongeBob walking on the street whistling, where nobody else is. SpongeBob hops over a boat that is in the middle of the road, then walks in the Krusty Krab, and stares out the order window. The sun is setting, and SpongeBob looks at his watch.] SpongeBob: Slow day. Good night, Squidward. Good night, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs' office door opens, revealing that Mr. Krabs is not there] [Cut back to SpongeBob's house.] SpongeBob: Gary, I'm home! Gary? You here, buddy? [walks into the kitchen, realizing that the big pile of food is still there] Gary? [gasps] He hasn't touched his food! [runs over to Squidward's house screaming, and then knocks on the door] Squidward! Open up! [door opens by itself] Squidward, have you seen Gary? He's gone missing! [no answer] Squidward? Not a sign of Squidward anywhere. Squidward? [walks upstairs] You up here? Hmm, Squidward's clarinet. [puts the clarinet in his mouth a few times] It's not even warm. Squidward's missing, too! [runs over to Patrick's house] Patrick, open up! Squidward and Gary are missing! [lifts up rock, revealing that there's nobody there] Patrick's gone, too. What if everybody's gone?! [cuts to the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs! [gasp] He's gone, too! [cuts to Sandy's house] Sandy! She's gone. [Cut to SpongeBob walking out of five buildings, saying \"Gone\" each time he exits one. He then runs forward on the street, hyperventilating.] SpongeBob: Where did everybody go?! [wide shot of Bikini Bottom, where SpongeBob's voice echoes off a cliff] Everybody's gone! But I swear that I will keep the memory of Bikini Bottom alive, by living out their lives for them. [Cut to the next day, where SpongeBob is blowing a bubble of himself, then plays a record of him laughing. He then runs into Squidward's house, takes the form of Squidward, and imitates him.] SpongeBob: [imitating Squidward] SpongeBob, will you be quiet? You're disrupting my genius. [plays off-key notes on Squidward's clarinet. Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs, sir, can I have a raise? [SpongeBob then sits in Mr. Krabs' chair and takes the form of Mr. Krabs and imitates him] No! Now get to work! [as SpongeBob] Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir! [Bubble transition to SpongeBob taking the form of Old Man Jenkins and imitating him.] SpongeBob: [imitating Old Man Jenkins] Excuse me, sonny, may I have a Krabby Patty Deluxe please? [as Squidward, with normal voice] Right away, sir! [imitates Squidward] I mean... whatever. [sticks head in the kitchen] Hey, SpongeBob, we got an order for a Krabby Patty Deluxe. Heaven knows why. [giggles, then moves a box that looks like him] Coming up, Squidward! [Bubble transition to SpongeBob at Patrick's house where he is sleeping and snoring in Patrick's form. Bubble transition to Sandy's house.] SpongeBob: Excuse me, Sandy, but may I have some more of this delicious iced tea? [as Sandy] Why, sure! Whoops, just a sec. [grows a tail] Why sure now, SpongeBob. [Bubble transition to Mrs. Puff's Boating School, with SpongeBob as Mrs. Puff.] SpongeBob: [imitating Mrs. Puff] Good morning, class. Can anyone tell me the first thing you do when riding a boat? [as himself] Ahem, floor it? [as Mrs. Puff] That's right, you floor it. Excellent work, SpongeBob! [as himself] Why thank you, Mrs.... [sadly] Pu... Pu... Puff! [starts to cry] This is pointless! I'm no Mrs. Puff! I can't replace everyone! I'll never be happy again! [notices a stack of blank driver's licenses on the desk] Ooh, my driver's license! [Cut to SpongeBob, taking a picture of him to put in the license.] SpongeBob: That's the baby. [he then walks up to a boat] Hi, fella, it's me. [boat drives away, SpongeBob then pulls it back up] It's okay, I'm licensed. [SpongeBob gets in the boat and starts it up] Oh yeah, listen to that purr! La-la-la- [SpongeBob starts driving it around Bikini Bottom causing destruction] -la-la-la... [SpongeBob falls asleep and drives into Patrick's house, causing it to skid up, missing Squidward's house, and then crashes into the top floor of SpongeBob's house.] SpongeBob: [in bed] Good night, Boaty. [Cut to SpongeBob having nightmares and talking in his sleep.] SpongeBob: No. No! [wakes up and screams] No! [pants] Oh, Gary, I had a nightmare that all my friends were gone! And I was driving a-! [screams and notices that Boaty is right next to him in bed] So it was true! I... guess it's just you and me now, Boaty. [Scene cuts to him and Boaty taking a shower, then eating cereal, then crashing out of the pineapple riding it, then jellyfishing, then at the Goo Lagoon, then on the seesaw, then driving into the Krusty Krab.] SpongeBob: This is where I work. Do you want to help me cook up some Krabby Patties? [silence] Great! [puts a box of Krabby Patties under Boaty's tire, then moving it to get the patties on the grill] Back when everyone was around, they used to enjoy these. Here, try one. [throws a Krabby Patty under his hood, it then splatters everywhere] What? You don't like Krabby Patties? Huh! Well, I guess we can still make this work. [Scene cuts to SpongeBob driving Boaty into the pineapple.] SpongeBob: Whew. Boy, we learned a lot about each other today. You know? I thought I'd go crazy without all my friends and acquaintances around, but it looks like you were all I needed to stay sane! [Boaty rumbles] What? A puppet of my old best friend? [Boaty rumbles again] Made entirely out of Krabby Patty meat? [laughs] Oh, Boaty, you are a card. [walks into a closet, where he is talking to the puppet Boaty was talking about earlier] Sorry I'm late, Patrick. Boaty was telling me a joke. [SpongeBob sticks his hand in there and starts talking for him] Krabby Patty Patrick: You're awfully chummy with that guy for someone who has it out for you. SpongeBob: Who, Boaty? [giggles] Oh no. He's... Really? Krabby Patty Patrick: I can't talk now. He's watching us. SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick! Don't go! [notices Boaty is staring at him] Huh? Nothing! Boaty! I... I'm just going to bed. French Narrator: Three days later... SpongeBob: [writing in his diary] Dear diary, not sure if I can trust any vehicle. Run for it as soon as the coast is clear. [SpongeBob looks out of the plant he's hiding in, seeing there's no one there, walks into a closet, where Boaty comes in, SpongeBob screams and bursts through the wall of his house. He runs into another boat and screams] [runs into a boat rental and screams] [SpongeBob runs inside The Reef theater. Cut to inside one of the theater rooms, where SpongeBob looks around to make sure there is no Boaty. He pulls up some popcorn and turns to the screen, a movie about vehicles is being shown, and screams. SpongeBob runs out of the theater, and he grabs an ax and looks for Boaty. He sees a bus coming toward him and strikes at it with his ax. The bus stops, and everyone in Bikini Bottom steps out.] SpongeBob: Huh? Mr. Krabs: Sheesh. Calm down, boy. SpongeBob: You're all still alive? Well, where did you go? Mr. Krabs: It was National No SpongeBob Day. SpongeBob: National No SpongeBob Day? Mr. Krabs: Yeah. A whole day dedicated to getting away from you. SpongeBob: A day? But you guys have been gone for weeks. Mr. Krabs: Uhh... heh heh, yeah well... we kinda milked it a little. [Patrick comes out of the bus with balloons and a T-shirt with SpongeBob crossed out on it.] SpongeBob: You too, Patrick? Patrick: Yeah. Everyone needs at least one day away from... [imitates SpongeBob's laugh] SpongeBob: [sadly] Well, I'm... glad you had fun. [sobs] Mr. Krabs: Aww, cheer up, boy. It's a whole day inspired by you. SpongeBob: Really? Mr. Krabs: Of course. [cut to a flashback of everyone in Bikini Bottom except SpongeBob around a SpongeBob made of wood] First, we built a giant wooden effigy of you, then we burned it to the ground. [the citizens burn it] Whoo-hoo! Burn, baby! [cut to everyone dancing on the ashes of the effigy] And danced on the ashes like there was no tomorrow. [flashback ends] SpongeBob: Wow. A whole day dedicated to me. [blushes] Patrick: Big deal. Wait 'til you see \"No Patrick Day.\" Come on, everyone. Let's go! [Everyone gets on the bus. SpongeBob knocks Patrick off when he tries to get on. Patrick immediately forgets what happened.] Patrick: Where'd everybody go? Hello? Hello? [looks around]",

  "synopsis": "The episode starts at Bikini Bottom Boats, where SpongeBob is being suggested numerous boatmobiles by a boat salesperson. The one that catches his attention the most is the self-driving car, Coupe, which he then buys. He shows his brand-new boat to Squidward and Mrs. Puff, who are really surprised that SpongeBob had the ability to obtain such a fancy vehicle.At night, SpongeBob parks Coupe in his respective lot, but Coupe wants to be inside the house since it began raining, so SpongeBob carves a large quantity of his pineapple house to accommodate Coupe. The latter wants to sleep on SpongeBob's bed, leaving SpongeBob and Gary no choice but to sleep outside in the rain due to Coupe honking when he snores.The following day, SpongeBob uses Coupe to get to the Krusty Krab and picks up Patrick, but Coupe ejects him after the latter annoys him with pushing his buttons. Arriving at the restaurant, he disapproves of being seen around the restaurant since he thinks it is too disgusting for his fanciness. As a result, instead of letting SpongeBob go to work, he forces him to do what he wants, which involves being pampered at an auto repair shop. SpongeBob lyingly claims that he has to use the bathroom, so Coupe sets him free for a moment, unaware of his intentions.However, he suspects that SpongeBob is up to something harmful upon witnessing his buying a bag from the car store. When SpongeBob returns, he takes what is revealed to be a steering wheel out of the bag and installs it to Coupe to get to the Krusty Krab. Coupe prevents SpongeBob from getting to work by restraining him with his seatbelts. To escape from his manipulation, SpongeBob orders a triple Krabby Patty with five scoops of ice cream from the drive-thru and throws it onto Coupe, interfering with his operation. He is eventually lifted by Patrick, who wants the ice cream in which Coupe is covered.SpongeBob gives up his self-driving days. Coupe asks what he plans on doing with him, and ends up becoming a kiddie ride outside of the Krusty Krab. He is rode excessively by Patrick while the latter eats ice cream, much to his misery and suffering, as the episode ends.",

  "transcript": "[The episode begins with SpongeBob pretending to be a stunt driver in one of the boats at the Bikini Bottom Boat store.] SpongeBob: [imitates engine revving] I'm a stunt driver, and I'm making donuts! [screeches] Out of the way! [screeches] Look out! Where'd you learn to drive, buddy? Oh, Mrs. Puff's Boating School? Me too! [laughs] Ahh, the bridge is out! Ahhh! Boat salesperson: That's a sweet little boat. You're a smart shopper. SpongeBob: Oh, I'm not shopping. I'm playing. Boat salesperson: Playing, huh? Well, we have some very playful items here for a\u2014a\u2014 SpongeBob: [acts very goofy] Ehh-ehh. Boat salesperson: ...Sophisticated motorist like yourself. [grabs SpongeBob by the eyes] SpongeBob: Whoa! Boat salesperson: [shows SpongeBob the Nerdmobile] The Nerdmobile. It comes with pocket protectors, corrective lens windshield and seat wedgies. SpongeBob: [gets a wedgie from the Nerdmobile] Ah-ow! Wow. Boat salesperson: No, this isn't right. I got something more your style. [grabs SpongeBob] SpongeBob: Whee! [gets thrown into the Wimp Wagon] Boat salesperson: The Wimp Wagon. It includes unlimited tissues for crying, a security blanket, [a blanket pops out from the steering wheel and SpongeBob sucks his thumb] and a bumper bonnet for your [pushes the bumper bonnet down on SpongeBob] delicate fontanel. SpongeBob: Oh, these are very nice, but I don't have a driver's license. Boat salesperson: No license, huh? Well, you don't need a license to drive a self-driving boat. SpongeBob: Self-driving? [gets pulled out of the Wimp Wagon] Boat salesperson: [shows SpongeBob a platinum self-driving boat] Meet Coupe. It's very classy. Chrome-plated exterior, titanium hubcaps, turbine engine, and personal driver narration. SpongeBob: [wide-eyed] Ooh. Whaaa! [gives the boat salesperson money] Sold! Boat salesperson: Oh, thanks! [laughs as he flies away] SpongeBob: Ahhh! My very own boat. Ah! [jumps into the boat and goes to drive it, but he finds the steering wheel and the key ignition missing] Huh? But there's no key! And no steering wheel! [stammers as he pushes various buttons] Where is that\u2014I gotta\u2014 [a cat meows on the boat's DVD screen] How do you\u2014 [jumps on the seat, until a robot arm grabs him and sits him down] Coupe: Settle down, Mr. SquarePants. SpongeBob: Wow, you talk. How'd you know my name? Coupe: I can feel your square pants on my seat. Where to, Mr. SquarePants? SpongeBob: Oh, why don't we just go for a drive? Coupe: You've got it. SpongeBob: [Coupe fastens the seatbelt around SpongeBob and begins to drive out of the Bikini Bottom Boat store and onto the street] Whoa, careful! And stay in your lane! Stop sign! Stop sign! Truck, truck, truck, truck! [almost gets hit by a truck] Ah! Coupe: Relax, Mr. SquarePants. I'm an expert driver. Make yourself at home and leave everything to me. [pours a cup of tea while SpongeBob has a blanket on and his shoes off, relaxing] Squidward: [looking through the window at a clarinet store] Hmm? Huh? [sees SpongeBob riding Coupe and playing instruments along the way] SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! [blows a clarinet in Squidward's face] Squidward: [bewildered] Oh, I need to erase this from my mind. [pulls his nose to open his head, takes out his brain, erases it clean with a pencil, and puts his brain back in, making him dumb] Duh! What's a SpongeBob?! [drools] SpongeBob: [reads his book until he sees Mrs. Puff driving next to him] Oh, hi, Mrs. Puff. What do you think of my classy new boat? Mrs. Puff: Hello, SpongeBob. SpongeBob! Ah! You're not driving! SpongeBob: I know! Isn't it great? Mrs. Puff: [hears a truck horn honking] Ahhh! [Mrs. Puff swerves her boat and crashes into a junkyard. She then gets smooshed and crushed by the boat-smashing machine and then puffs up. She groans and pulls the boat off of her. Meanwhile, Coupe drives SpongeBob to his house.] SpongeBob: [jumps out] Oh, that was the best day of non-driving ever. Coupe, is there anything I can get you? Warm glass of oil? Triple-foam conditioner? Coupe: I'm fine. Good night, Mr. SquarePants. SpongeBob: Good night, Coupe. [kisses Coupe and goes in his house] [At night, thunder roars and it starts to rain. Coupe honks its horn.] SpongeBob: What's wrong, Coupe? Coupe: I'm getting wet. SpongeBob: [struggles to pull an umbrella from him pants, but it opens inside] Whoa! [pulls the umbrella out] Here, take this! [gives Coupe the umbrella and goes back inside; Coupe honks its horn again] What's up? Coupe: I'm cold. SpongeBob: Aww. [wraps Coupe with a blanket] There you go, my widdle self-driver. Nice and snuggy-wuggy. Coupe: I don't like it out here. I want to be inside. SpongeBob: Inside? [saws a hole big enough for Coupe to fit] All right, Coupe. Come on in. [Coupe drives inside the house and begins flipping the channels with the remote.] SpongeBob: Hey, you know what'd be fun? If I sat in you and we pretended we were in a drive-in movie. Coupe: No, it wouldn't. SpongeBob: Okay, so I guess you're just gonna click through the channels looking for a boat commercial all night, huh? Coupe: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I was a guest here. [shines its lights at SpongeBob's eyes] SpongeBob: Of course you are. [rubs his eyes] Well, I'm tired. You can stay up. I'm going to bed. [goes upstairs] Oh, Coupe? Good-night. I had a wonderful day. [Coupe doesn't listen to SpongeBob and continues flipping the channels. SpongeBob, feeling rejected, sulks upstairs to his room. Moments later while sleeping with Gary, SpongeBob hears a rumbling sound coming up the stairs.] SpongeBob: Ohh! Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Gary, what is that? [the door opens; SpongeBob and Gary hover together in fear; it turns out to be Coupe as it honks its horn; Coupe climbs into SpongeBob's bed, crushing it] Coupe: Sorry, Mr. SquarePants. I'm so... [yawns] SpongeBob: I know, Coupe. You're tired. We're all tired. [Coupe snores through its horn as SpongeBob and Gary go downstairs to sleep on the couch. A few steps crumble from the damage done by Coupe's wheels. A few hours later, SpongeBob and Gary sleep peacefully on the couch. But a loud sound from Coupe's horn startles them both, which resulted in Gary scratching SpongeBob's face.] SpongeBob: Ow. [Now totally feeling rejected and hurt, SpongeBob goes outside in the cold, rainy night with Gary and sleeps on the driveway while holding an umbrella. The next day, SpongeBob, who is extremely tired from such a long night, is making his way to the Krusty Krab. Suddenly, Coupe drives up to SpongeBob.] Coupe: Mr. SquarePants, I can drive you to work. Why are you walking? SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, well, I didn't want to wake you. You were sleeping like a baby. Heh. Baby buggy! [laughs] Baby buggy... [falls asleep] [Coupe grabs SpongeBob, puts him in the driver seat and begins to drive. Suddenly, Coupe accidentally bumps into Patrick.] Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, how about a ride? SpongeBob: Well, sure, Patrick. Hop in. Patrick: Yay! [hops into Coupe's passenger seat; Coupe's horn blares and resumes driving] Oh, oh boy! Buttons! [pushes various buttons with his hands, tongue, and buttocks like a crazy idiot] SpongeBob: [Coupe's wheels stretch out] Uh, Patrick, could you not\u2014 [Coupe spins around] I don't think he\u2014 [the trunk opens and knocks out extra wheels] Don't get your\u2014 Patrick: [laughs] Butt on buttons! SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick, I don't think Coupe likes that. Coupe: [grabs Patrick and sits him down] Passenger, settle down. [smacks Patrick's face with the seatbelt several times for his stupidity and fastens him, making him pop chocolate ice cream out from his bellybutton] SpongeBob: Hey, ice cream. Where's the cone? Patrick: Oh, don't worry. It's down there somewhere. Ahh. [puts ice cream on his tongue and resumes pushing various buttons with his ice cream-covered hands] Coupe: [groans and spits in disgust while Patrick plays with the buttons] Ugh, eww! All right, that's enough! [ejects Patrick out of the passenger seat] Patrick: Thanks for the ride! [Coupe stops at the Krusty Krab.] SpongeBob: Here we are. Coupe: Here we are, where? SpongeBob: Where I work, the Krusty Krab. Coupe: What? I can't be seen here. I'm a classy car. This place is tacky. [the chimney makes a flatulence sound] SpongeBob: [struggles to unhook the seatbelt and open the door, but to no avail] Coupe, open the door! I'll be late! [Coupe drives away] Yow! But I have to go to work! Ah. [sulks into his driver seat] Coupe: You obviously have no taste, so today we're going to do what I want to do. SpongeBob: But I have to go to work. [groans] [Coupe drives over to the boat wash where it is getting scrubbed and clean. SpongeBob is not too thrilled with what Coupe is doing as he is getting sprayed and scrubbed on in his face.] SpongeBob: I have to go to work. [Coupe is now at the garage getting itself waxed, its engine repaired, and its wheel pumped up.] SpongeBob: [growing impatient] But I have to go to work! [Coupe gets its finger nails on its robot hand filed, its wheels massaged and is offered a glass of oil. One of the mechanics gives SpongeBob the bill.] SpongeBob: Huh? [looks at the bill and pays the mechanic] Ugh. I have to go\u2014 Coupe: Go to work? SpongeBob: No, go to the bathroom. Coupe: You can hold it. SpongeBob: Or I could just go. [unzips his pants and Coupe unhooks the seatbelt in disgust] Coupe: Ugh. Make it snappy. [slaps SpongeBob with the seatbelt] SpongeBob: Ow! [groans] [SpongeBob heads out of the garage. But unbeknownst to him, Coupe's headlights turn red and starts scanning like a security camera.] Coupe: Hmm? Hmm. [sees SpongeBob going into the parts store and buying something there] Hmm. [becomes angry] Hmm. SpongeBob: [walks out of the store with a bag and sees Coupe spying on him] Eh? [hides the bag and whistles back into the garage; he goes to the driver seat, but Coupe drive away a few inches] Hmm. [stammers as he tries again, but Coupe drives away again; Coupe drives out of the garage and onto the street] Very funny, Coupe. Very funny. Coupe: What's in the bag? SpongeBob: Oh, nothing. [Coupe drives away] Hey, wait! [jumps into the driver seat] Coupe: What are you doing, SquarePants? SpongeBob: I'm going to work. [pulls out a steering wheel from his bag and jams it onto the control panel; then he jams an accelerator on the bottom and places a bobble-head on the windshield; he floors it and takes control of Coupe by turning it around] Coupe: Ooh. SpongeBob: Did that hurt? Coupe: Of course not. I'm a boat. I don't feel physical pain. SpongeBob: Good to know, [puts on a helmet] because I'm a stunt driver, and I'm making donuts! [SpongeBob spins Coupe around in circles and crashes into a fence.] Coupe: Oh, no you don't. Give me that! [grabs the steering wheel and turns around] [Coupe drives over a cliff and flies towards a first-class hotel.] SpongeBob: Yahh! Valet parking attendant: Ohh! [Coupe crashes through the doors and drives into the lobby.] Coupe: [laughs] Now this is where I should be living! [drives into the elevator] Penthouse parking lot, please. [the bellhop pushes the button on the elevator] Thank you. SpongeBob: Hi, how are you doing today? Good? [whistles] [The elevator reaches the penthouse parking lot on the rooftop. The penthouse parking lot consists of a bed, a gasoline pump, a smoker, palm trees, a stove, a radio stereo, and a pool.] SpongeBob: Well played, Coupe. Coupe: [shakes hands with SpongeBob] Indeed. [giggles] SpongeBob: Because now we can get to the Krusty Krab the fast way! [steers Coupe off the roof] Coupe: What? No! No! Noooo! [lands near the Krusty Krab] No, you don't! [SpongeBob tries to break free, but Coupe ties him up with the seatbelt] No, no, we're not going into the tacky Krusty Krab! SpongeBob: You're right, we're going through the drive-thru! [steers Coupe through the drive-thru with his tongue] Triple Krabby Patty with five scoops of ice cream, please. [strains as Coupe drives to the drive-thru window; Squidward gives SpongeBob his order while SpongeBob keeps fighting with Coupe] Squidward, you see me struggling with this boat, and you act like you don't care! Squidward: It's not an act. [closes the drive-thru window as Coupe drives away from the Krusty Krab] SpongeBob: [takes out his Triple Krabby Patty with ice cream] I hate to do this to you, Triple Krabby Patty with five scoops of ice cream, but I have no choice. [throws the ice cream-filled patty on the control panel] Coupe: No, no, stop! I don't like that! [screeches its tires as it drives out of control] Patrick: [appears on the road] Hey, SpongeBob! Coupe: Oh, not this idiot again! SpongeBob: Ahhh! [Patrick stops Coupe and lifts it up to lick the ice cream from the radiator] Patrick: Ah, I thought I smelled ice cream. [licks more ice cream] SpongeBob: My self-driving days are over. Coupe: What do you plan on doing with me, SquarePants? SpongeBob: Eh, I have an idea. [The scene changes to Patrick riding on Coupe at the Krusty Krab like a kiddie ride.] Patrick: These self-driving boats are real classy. [laughs until Coupe stops moving; Patrick grumbles and throws his ice cream on the hood] It stopped again. SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick. [gives him a bag of quarters] Here's a whole bag of quarters so you can ride forever. Patrick: Ohh! [puts a quarter through the slot and Coupe begins moving again] Coupe: Please, somebody, strip me, sell me for parts! Just put me out of my misery! [zoom out of the Krusty Krab, then the iris closes in on Coupe, ending the episode]",

  "synopsis": "At the Krusty Krab, the customers are very hungry. Squidward asks SpongeBob why the orders are not ready yet. SpongeBob explains that he is practicing for an oral report that he must do for boating school. Squidward says that \"public speaking\" causes stress, but then SpongeBob explains how he is good at \"public speaking.\" SpongeBob then walks out, ready to give the customers their orders, and gets scared because they are acting zombie-like.SpongeBob then realizes that he has stage fright. The customers start fighting for the single order as Squidward is beaten up after trying to give a customer his order, which makes SpongeBob even more frightened.It then cuts to Patrick's rock. Patrick opens it, only to realize he has the wrong rock, but SpongeBob pulls him in. SpongeBob asks Patrick to help him practice by listening to his speech. SpongeBob has to practice if he wants to pass then he has to give the report.SpongeBob begins to become very nervous, and Patrick decides that SpongeBob should see Sandy for help. Sandy deduces SpongeBob has a severe case of \"Oral-Reportitis,\" which is caused by stress of someone too nervous to present an oral report before a crowd, and is known to cause some victims to literally explode. To help him out, Sandy gives SpongeBob a pair of underwear with goggles on it, so SpongeBob can see people in their underwear so he will not feel nervous.The next day, SpongeBob is next to do his oral report and then he gets nervous for a prolonged time. SpongeBob asks Patrick for the goggles, and he gives SpongeBob the goggles while accidentally breaking them in the process while trying to polish them. Billy tells him to hurry up, and SpongeBob sees him in his underwear; he is relieved. Then he sees the whole class in their underwear. SpongeBob begins laughing and Mrs. Puff asks him why. SpongeBob sees Mrs. Puff's underwear and starts laughing even harder. SpongeBob begins reading his report but the goggles malfunction, causing it to give him the sight of everybody's underwear having scary faces. SpongeBob screams and runs away, he drives Mrs. Puff's boat, and Patrick and Mrs. Puff chase him. The police notice that SpongeBob ran a stop light and chase after him. SpongeBob then crashes through various buildings. The police question if he knows about \"boating safety\" and SpongeBob goes through a long explanation of \"boating safety.\" The police start crying and say it is beautiful. Mrs. Puff says that SpongeBob will have to go to jail and she will not have to teach him anymore. However, the police arrests Mrs. Puff instead because under penal code 26-1, SpongeBob's delinquent actions is under Mrs. Puff's care because he's a minor and she is his boating teacher, much to her dismay. After this, Patrick is happy that SpongeBob conquered his fear, and puts on the underwear glasses. He notices that SpongeBob's underwear starts talking angrily to him, so he runs away, ending the episode.",

  "transcript": "[The episode opens to the Krusty Krab and we see Squidward reading a magazine that reads Everybody Aplomb Now. He then looks from the magazine and see a bunch of fish on the tables staring at him. Squidward twitches his eyebrows in a suspicious way. One of the customers slowly closes his eyes and opened it back. Squidward jumps by this and another customer falls over and licks the floor. Everyone appears like they're about to have seizures.] Squidward: [whispers with clenched teeth] SpongeBob, why aren't those orders up yet? [cut to the scene where we see two fishes with forks and knives and they're moaning like zombies. Squidward is stunned by this. The scene cuts to the kitchen. He pokes his head through the window] SpongeBob, the collective blood sugar around here is dangerously low. [looks down on the grill to see some cards on it] Why are you grilling index cards? [close up to the index cards that talks about boating school] SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, I got a little distracted. [holding up an index card] I'm practicing for my oral report for Boating School tomorrow. Squidward: You know, SpongeBob, statistics show that public speaking is the number three cause of stress right behind death and marriage. Now get those orders ready! SpongeBob: Okay, okay! [takes off his hat and shoves out seven patties from inside it] Hm, what's so scary about public speaking anyway? You just stand in front of the public and speak publicly. It's really no different than what I do everyday. [The scene cuts to SpongeBob coming out of the kitchen with a Krabby Patty and gets shocked. We see a bunch of fish looking like zombies.] SpongeBob: No big deal, SpongeBob, you just stand in front of them... [cut to the scene where we see the customers moaning and the background changes to swirls] ...front of them looking... [backs away slowly to the kitchen] ...at me [closes the kitchen door, then peaks through the window and sees the customers] ...with their eyes! [shrieks and ducks] Squidward is right! Public speaking is frightening! Squidward: [grabs the Krabby Patty from SpongeBob] Must I do everything myself? [looks to his left] Huh? Stay back! You'll get your patty when it's your turn. [gets pulled back, then all customers begin to physically fight for the Krabby Patty, resulting in Squidward getting beaten up. SpongeBob stretches his legs up and peaks over at the window. He looks at the fight and ducks as a barrel crashes in his direction. SpongeBob pulls back steadily] SpongeBob: I never knew an audience can get so physical. [Squidward screams and is thrown to the back and is continuously mauled by the zombified customers] This changes everything. [slowly creeps away as Squidward still gets beaten up. The scene bubbles over to Patrick's rock and Patrick goes over to it and opens it. We see SpongeBob on the rock] Patrick: Oh, sorry, wrong rock. [turns to leave but SpongeBob stretches his arms to grab Patrick and takes him under the rock. Scene cuts to the inside of Patrick's home where we see that SpongeBob made it look exactly like the inside of Mrs. Puff's Boating School] SpongeBob: Patrick, I wonder if you'd help me by lending me your eyes. Patrick: Okay. [starts pulling at his eyes] Uhhh... SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, you can keep 'em. I just want you to watch me while I practice my speech up here. [referring to the little platform he made out of sand] Just pretend you're a student at his desk. Patrick: Okay. [goes over to one of the desks made of sand and sits on it] SpongeBob: [gets on the little platform and holds up an index card] Patrick: H-Hold on, I'd like to sit in the back of the class. [moves the sand desk a little farther, stops, then moves up a little] SpongeBob: Okay, here goes. [reads] Boating safety is... Patrick: SpongeBob, can I have a hall pass? SpongeBob: Not now, Patrick. Just sit tight and let me practice. Patrick: Fine. SpongeBob: [clears throat] Boating safe... Patrick: Boring! Next! SpongeBob: Patrick, you're kinda derailing the proceedings here. Just focus on me, huh? Patrick: All right, all right. [looks closely toward SpongeBob. Cut to a close-up of Patrick's face and he blinks his eyes] SpongeBob: So, without further ado... [sees that Patrick has fallen asleep] Patrick? [taps Patrick's forehead] Patrick, wake up. [Patrick slowly wakes up] What happened, Patrick? Patrick: Oh, come on, SpongeBob, you think everyone can stay awake through a boring speech? SpongeBob: I don't know. Do you think that's too much to expect? Patrick: Yes! And you should be prepared for worse. SpongeBob: Worse? Patrick: You're gonna have things thrown at you that you wouldn't believe. You gotta be ready. Now try again. SpongeBob: Okay. [stands on the small platform] Boating safety... [a pillow is thrown at his face] Boating safe... [more pillows are thrown at SpongeBob and we see that Patrick is the one that's throwing the pillows-fed up with his oral speaking, wants him to either stop or present more better and interesting] Patrick: That's it! [grunts] Fight through! [SpongeBob is buried in a pile of pillows, but he rises up from the pile panting] SpongeBob: Patrick, nobody throws pillows in class. Patrick: Says you! Speech! SpongeBob: Boating safe... [Patrick walks up to him dressed up like Mrs. Puff] Patrick: [imitating Mrs. Puff] SpongeBob SquarePants, what a mess you've made of my classroom. SpongeBob: You sorta add a hand in that, too, Patrick. Patrick: [imitating Mrs. Puff] Young man, how dare you? [writes into a small notebook, tears a paper out, and hands it to SpongeBob, which is a detention slip] SpongeBob: What, a detention slip? Patrick: [imitating Mrs. Puff] I'm not hearing your oral report. SpongeBob: Okay. [reads] Boating safe... [a treadmill is place under him and he's running on it] Patrick: Try again. SpongeBob: [panting] Boating safety... [Patrick bangs on cymbals causing SpongeBob to lose his balance and hang on the handles] Patrick: Come on, SquarePants! Is this the best you can do? SpongeBob: Patrick, somehow I don't think this is working. [As he is saying this his body starts to shred into a pile of yellow dust with his arms on top of it due to his body being on the treadmill] Patrick: [shouts] Speech! [SpongeBob turns to normal and yells] Speech! Speech! Speech! [SpongeBob gets nervous] Speech! Speech! Speech! [SpongeBob shivers. Now Patrick's eyes are talking] Speech! Speech! Speech! [Now SpongeBob is more nervous] Speech! Speech! Spee - SpongeBob: Patrick, stop! Somehow your help just isn't helping. I am more nervous about this oral report than I've ever been about anything. [shudders] Patrick: Yeah, you do look pretty terrible. SpongeBob: Well, if I don't do my report, then I don't pass. And if I don't pass, then I don't get my boating license! [starts crying] Patrick: Wait, buddy! I know how you can get your boating license. Your friend the squirrel girl is real good with her paws. [holds up his hands that look exactly like a squirrel's] Maybe she can make you a fake one. SpongeBob: No, Patrick, that's illegal, but she might be able to help me get over this anxiety. She's always speaking at science conferences. She's probably full of pointers. Patrick: Yeah, or she probably has a robot that can demolish the whole school for ya. [SpongeBob looks surprised at what Patrick says. Scene bubbles over to Sandy who is examining SpongeBob with her magnifying glass] Sandy: White knuckles, leaky pores, stomach in knots... Y-yep. He looks pretty bad. SpongeBob, you're afflicted with severe oral report-itis. You know, patients with this disease have been known to physically explode. Ker-pow! SpongeBob: [shudders] Sandy: It has been scientifically proven that [pulls a piece of paper down with a person on it] 85% of speech related stress can be eliminated if the speaker imagines the audience in their underwear. [SpongeBob's hand take the clothes off the person and he covers his underwear. He tears the page to cover his underwear] Sandy: Everyone will look so silly, you won't even remember you're nervous. Which is why I invented these. [shows an underwear with goggles stuck to it] Goggles that let you see people in their undies. Or, I could just make you a fake boating license. SpongeBob: That's still illegal. Give me the goggles. [puts on the goggles but nothing's happening] It's not working. Sandy: Well, of course it isn't, silly. I'm only wearing my undies. See if they work on Patrick. SpongeBob: [turns to Patrick. He jumps at this] Eh. Yeah, they work. [Scene bubbles over to Mrs. Puff's Boating School] Incidental 152: ...and they were never heard from again. Mrs. Puff: Thank you, Billy. That was an excellent report. Next we have-- [crosses off Billy, then sees SpongeBob] --SpongeBob SquarePants. Ugh. Patrick: [zooms over to SpongeBob] Go on, buddy. SpongeBob: [gives Patrick a thumbs up. He gets out of his seat and goes to the front of the room. He clears his throat and then freezes. Cut to the other side of the class. Cut to SpongeBob. He gulps] Mrs. Puff: Well, SpongeBob? Do you have your oral report ready? SpongeBob: [in a small voice] Huh...? Mrs. Puff: The assignment I gave you. The one where you talk in front of the class. SpongeBob: Oh, yeah! Of course I'm ready. [starts sweating] I can do it. [Shubie checks her watch] Um... [Scene goes across the room. In another scene, the background is yellow. It also shows angry people and Patrick about to throw a pillow at him] Oh, no. Oh, no! Mrs. Puff: What are you doing?! SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, do I really have to do this? Mrs. Puff: No. Only if you want to pass this class. SpongeBob: Okay. [walks to the front of the room] Uh, my report...is on... [his pinky starts to vibrate and holds it] Heh! Must be last-minute jitters. [starts to vibrate too. He goes all around the front of the room and stops where he was before] Patrick, where are those goggles? Patrick: Here, let me polish 'em up for ya. [rubs his arm on the lens and it breaks] Here ya go. SpongeBob: Thanks. [puts them on] Billy: Hurry up! [in his underwear] SpongeBob: [gasps; sees other people are in their underwear, too] It's working! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ... Mrs. Puff: What's all this laughing about? [now wearing a bra and underwear] Well, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: [laughs] \"Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the ocean because -- [his broken lens start to function weird. Billy's underwear now has a scary face on it] Scary Face: Well, don't just stand there. Get on with it. SpongeBob: [screams as he sees the other underwear with scary faces on them] They're all staring! [throws the goggles on the floor, screams and runs out the door] Patrick: Hey, where are you going? You forgot the goggles! SpongeBob, wait! [SpongeBob drives a boat] Wait! SpongeBob! Mrs. Puff: [gasps] You can't take my boat! SpongeBob! Patrick: Wait! SpongeBob! Mrs. Puff: Come back here with my boat! Police Officer: Talk about a slow day at the office, huh? Police Officer #2: You said it, partner. My baton's itching for the noggin of a lawbreaker. SpongeBob: [screams as he runs a stop sign] Police Officer: Okay, forget what I just said. [Police Officer #1 and #2 chase after him] Police Officer: Sponge, pull over! SpongeBob: I don't know how! Patrick: SpongeBob! [SpongeBob breaks through three houses, smashes into the next one, goes flying, and lands on his head.] Police Officer: All right, kid, what was that all about? Police Officer #2: Don't you know anything about boating safety? SpongeBob: [looks surprised] Boating safety? Yes, Officer. I do. [gets back on his feet] Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the whole ocean. Each boater must follow the rules and regulations stipulated in the boater safety handbook. When the meaning of all important signs... ...pay attention to all surroundings... ...when wet means no parking... ...it already figures... ...always blah blah blah... ...with all shades of curve... ...remember... ...a motor vehicle is 20,000 pounds of blah blah-- [After SpongeBob ends his report, the officers are touched by this and cry tears of joy and astonishment.] Police Officer #2: Gee, kid. [wipes a tear from his eye] That was beautiful. Police Officer: Yeah. I never even knew some of those things myself. Mrs. Puff: [maliciously] Aha! Finally. The long arm of the laws caught up with you. I guess I won't be seeing you in my driver's education class for the next 5 to 10 years! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Police Officer: Wait, wait, Miss Chuckles. Did you say you were his boating instructor? Mrs. Puff: [getting nervous] Yes. Why? Police Officer: Under penal code 26-1 quote, \"The boating instructor is responsible--\" SpongeBob: --\"for any minor delinquent actions under that teacher's care.\" Police Officer: Unquote. I'm afraid we're gonna have to take you in, madame. [handcuffs Mrs. Puff and puts her in the police car] Mrs. Puff: [dismayed] What? [she is taken away by police] No! Patrick: Hey, buddy, you got over your fear of giving an oral talking thing. SpongeBob: Hey, I did! Thanks, pal! Patrick: Oh, that reminds me. [shows the goggles] You forgot these. [puts them on] Whoa-ho! Oh, they really work, huh. [the scary face appears] Scary Face: And what are you lookin' at? Patrick: Huh? [screams and runs away]",
