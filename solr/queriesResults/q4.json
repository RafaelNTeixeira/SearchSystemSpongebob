  "synopsis": [
   "As the special opens, it is almost Christmas in Encino, California, and Patchy the Pirate, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, is deep in preparations for the holiday. With the help of his unenthusiastic assistant, Potty the Parrot, Patchy sets pictures of SpongeBob and Patrick on the mantelpiece, puts up his various SpongeBob-themed ornaments, and bakes Christmas cookies, the dough of which Potty eats. Patchy also takes time to open a letter from a fan, who asks if SpongeBob likes Christmas as much as he does. Patchy remarks that there was once a time when Christmas in Bikini Bottom was unheard of and decides to tell the tale.Outside Sandy's treedome, SpongeBob is dressed in his karate gear and preparing to give Sandy a surprise sneak attack. Inside, Sandy is putting up Christmas lights, which SpongeBob mistakes for fire and tries to put it out with sea water. After recovering from the drenching, Sandy is shocked to find out that SpongeBob has never heard of Christmas and tells him all about it.Later at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob passes the story of Christmas on to Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs. Everyone in Bikini Bottom, except Squidward, is excited at the idea of Santa Claus bearing gifts, and they all, except Squidward, put their Christmas letters into glass bottles, which are then shot up to the surface for Santa to receive as the act ends. The Bikini Bottomites decorate for Christmas as SpongeBob and Patrick sing a song. They even decorate Squidward's house, which Squidward does not agree with. After the song, Squidward closes his blinds.Act 2 begins as SpongeBob is sending the last of the letters to Santa and finds out Squidward still has not written his letter yet. SpongeBob and a few citizens try to get him to write a letter and be in the Christmas spirit, but it fails. In the days leading up to Christmas, the people of Bikini Bottom heartily celebrate, and on Christmas Eve, they stand in front of the large, decorated coral tree and sing, eagerly awaiting the arrival of Santa. Squidward, refusing to believe in Santa Claus, takes no part in any of the mirths.The people continue to sing until morning, when they realize that Santa has not come. Everyone leaves in disappointment, and they call SpongeBob out on his lying. Patrick tries to tell the people that Santa had stopped for a snack and so SpongeBob and Patrick are waiting for Santa, until they realize that he really does not exist, SpongeBob becomes heartbroken. In reality, Santa didn't come because they were supposed to be asleep. Squidward wakes and comes out, at last, laughing at SpongeBob's humiliation, and even takes a photo to commemorate the occasion.As SpongeBob sadly trudges away, he hands Squidward a present. Squidward, still skeptical, opens it to find a hand-carved driftwood clarinet. Squidward sees how SpongeBob has only been trying to spread joy, he feels very remorseful for what he did, and decides to make up for his rudeness. He dresses up as Santa and surprises SpongeBob, who thanks him for bringing Christmas to Bikini Bottom.Squidward prepares to go back inside his house but is approached by a little girl, asking him for a present. Out of desperation, Squidward gives the child a large wrench, which pleases her greatly. A large crowd arrives asking for presents, and he ends up giving away everything he owns. Squidward realizes the lengths he has gone to in preserving SpongeBob's dream, and after shooing away an excited SpongeBob, he discovers a note on his doorstep, which turns out to be a message from Santa thanking him for his help. He looks up in time to see the real Santa Claus soaring overhead in his sleigh, as he is shocked that he was wrong about his existence. At a loss at seeing Santa, he dismisses himself as being insane and plays his new clarinet before going back inside.After finishing his story, Patchy has to deal with Potty perching on his head. However, it turns out the parrot merely lays him a gift of goodwill, which touches Patchy's heart. Patchy then proceeds to step under the mistletoe, inviting the ladies to come by for a smooch, only for Potty to start swooping after him. With Patchy preoccupied, the narrator rounds things off by wishing a \"Good night, and Happy Holidays,\" to end the special."

   "[The scene pans over live-action houses.] French Narrator: And now, direct from Encino, America's favorite pirate and president of the SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club: Patchy the Pirate. [the exterior of Patchy's house is shown. The name \"Patchy\" appears. Inside, Patchy is wrapping presents] Patchy the Pirate: [to the tune of \"Jingle Bells\"] Yo ho ho, yo ho ho, yo ho ho ho ho. [notices he's on air] Oh! Hi! [waves] I'm Patchy the Pirate, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club! [notices a long piece of confetti on his hook and tries to shake it off. He pulls on it and whacks himself in the eye, giving him a black eye. He switches his patch over to the other eye] Hey, that's better! [Potty, a puppet bird on strings, flies in] Potty the Parrot: [squawks] Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Patchy: That's right, Potty! It is Christmas. [he limps over to the fireplace] And there ain't nothing better in the seven seas than a Bikini Bottom Christmas. It sure is a magical time of year. [he blows on his pipe, and bubbles emerge] Why, I'll bet old SpongeBob is gearing up for Santa Claus right now! [He picks up a picture of SpongeBob. Cuts to SpongeBob, holding a remote] SpongeBob: I sure am! [He presses a button on the remote. A large chimney rises from the ground next to his house, and a gigantic funnel pops out of it with the words \"Welcome Santa\" in neon letters] I'm ready! [Patchy laughs] Patchy: Not bad for a creature with no vertebrae. [he puts down SpongeBob's picture] And I'm sure our pal Patrick is doing his share of the decorating. [He picks up a picture of Patrick. Cuts to Patrick standing by his house with a dopey smile on his face. Zooms out to reveal a single ornament hanging from the antenna on top of his rock. It snaps off and hits the ground. Patrick then falls to the ground as well. Now, Patchy is mixing cookie dough] I too am also preparing for Christmas. [he lifts up the mixer] Hmm, unbaked cookie dough! [he takes a lick] Mmm... Potty: [squawks] Potty want cookie dough! [Potty flies over, squawking] Cookie! [Patchy ducks] Patchy: Potty! No! [Potty flies back and forth] Potty: Cookie! [squawks] Patchy: Get out of here! Potty: Cookie! Patchy: Potty! Potty: [squawks] Give us a lick! Patchy: Back off, you flying freak! [Potty flies on the counter] Potty: [squawks] Clarify please. Patchy: [the cookies are shaped like SpongeBob and Patrick] This here cookie dough is for the children, not for pesky parrots. [Cuts to Hans reaching over and ringing a bell. Patchy looks out the window] Patchy: What's that? Three bells! Well, we all know what three bells means! Children: [off-screen] Free ice cream! [Patchy laughs] Patchy: No, you silly livers. [sternly] No! Potty: [squawks] Man overboard? [Patchy walks over to a desk] Patchy: You, I'm ignoring. [he sits down] No, it's time to open fan letters! [Potty flies over with a letter in his beak] Potty: [squawks] Here you go! [Patchy tugs at it] Patchy: Thank you, Potty. [Potty is not letting go] Yeah. Okay Potty, thank you! [Potty squawks, still not letting go] Come on, give it, you birdbrain! [Potty squawks some more] Quiet, infernal bird! [He uses his hook, now with a pair of scissors on the end, to snip Potty's strings. Potty squawks and falls to the ground. Patchy nods] Hmm. [he sits back down] This letter comes to us from... Fish Head: [as voiceover] Name and address withheld! [Patchy tears the envelope open, pieces of it flying all over. He pulls up his eye patch and replaces it with a pair of reading glasses with one eye covered up] Patchy: And he writes, \"Dear SpongeBob, I am ten years old, and I was wondering if you like Christmas as much as I do. Sincerely yours...\" Fish Head: [as voiceover] Name and address withheld! [Patchy gets up and takes off his glasses. Now his eye patch is back on] Patchy: A very good question. But you know they didn't always celebrate Christmas in Bikini Bottom. Potty: [squawks] They didn't? Patchy: No sir, my fine feathered little neck pain. [He pulls down Potty's strings. Potty falls to the ground, and a puppeteer falls down from above the set. Patchy hangs a homemade SpongeBob ornament on a Christmas tree. Zooms out, showing the entire tree, which is decorated with many similar SpongeBob, as well as ornaments featuring Patrick and Squidward, and a few gift boxes] There was a time when no one had even heard of Christmas in Bikini Bottom. [he snaps his fingers] Hey! Who wants to hear the story of SpongeBob's very first Christmas? [Cuts to Potty, who looks very drowsy and with bloodshot eyes. Patchy turns around] Potty? [Patchy sees an empty bowl of cookie dough, accompanied by a foghorn noise] You ate all me cookie dough! [Potty is now incredibly fat. Potty's body and strings fall off, leaving only the bird's head] Potty: Squ-ouch! [Patchy shrugs] Patchy: Oh, well, on with the show. [Plays the title card and opening credits. Afterwards, a bubble transition plays, revealing a sunset with Sandy's treedome. SpongeBob is shown waiting on a hill near Sandy's treedome, wearing karate gloves] SpongeBob: [laughs] Today, I'm gonna sneak up and get that Sandy with a super sneaky karate move. [practices karate and sneaks over to Sandy's door as Sandy hums \"Jingle Bells\"] SpongeBob: What diabolical act is she committing now? [Sandy plugs in Christmas lights outside her tree and SpongeBob freaks out] Fire! Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming! Stand back, Sandy, fire! [rushes inside and instead of throwing water on tree, he throws it on Sandy] Huh? So I guess there's no fire? Sandy: What in the name of the Alamo is wrong with you, SpongeBob? Ain't you never seen a Christmas tree before? SpongeBob: Christmas who? Sandy: What?! Y'all never heard of Christmas? SpongeBob: Is she a friend from Texas? Sandy: [laughs] No. I can't believe you haven't heard of... [makes an adorable face] ...Christmas. SpongeBob: Tell me more about this... [imitates Sandy] ...\"Christmas.\" Patchy: [voiceover] And so, Sandy wove the magical tale of gumdrops and pennywhistles. She told of toy-making elves and flying reindeer. But best of all, she told of the one they call, Santa Claus. [SpongeBob's eyes widen] [The next day at The Krusty Krab] SpongeBob: [standing on a table towards Squidward, Patrick and Mr. Krabs] And everyone pretends to like the fruitcake. Squidward: Yawn. SpongeBob: But the best part is you can write a letter to this guy, Santa Claus, and tell him what you want, and when he comes he brings it to you. Patrick: Just like a genie. [laughs] Mr. Krabs: I dunno about you, lubbers, but any fella who's giving away free stuff, is a friend o' mine. SpongeBob: That's the spirit, Mr. Krabs. [grabs a piece of paper and pencil] Here you go! You can get started on your letter. Squidward: I can't believe anybody would celebrate a holiday where a jolly prowler breaks into your house and leaves gifts. Patrick: Like a genie. Mr. Krabs: Pipe down, Squidward. I'm trying to concentrate. This thing is as good as a blank check direct from the First National Bank of Santa Claus. Squidward: Oh, brother. Patrick: Yeah. SpongeBob: Okay, who's next? Patrick: Ooh, ooh, me, me! Squidward: Ooh. SpongeBob: Here you go, Patrick. Patrick: There's no words on this paper. SpongeBob: Not yet. Patrick: [grabs a pencil] Yippee! A writing stick. SpongeBob: C'mon, Squidward. Write a letter. Squidward: SpongeBob, grow up will ya? No one's going to give me a gift just because I write them a stupid letter. [Patrick's letter tears in half] Patrick: SpongeBob, I ripped my paper. Could I have another one? SpongeBob: Sure, buddy. Here you go. Okie dokie, Squid... [Patrick rips his again] ...ward. Patrick: Uhh, SpongeBob... [hands him another piece] Thanks. [sits down and starts writing with the paper on top of the pencil] Dear Sant... [paper rips] D'oh! Not again. SpongeBob: Here, Patrick, watch me. [starts to write] \"Dear Santa, what do I want for Christmas, you may ask? All I want is for you to visit the gentle folk here in Bikini Bottom. That is my wish.\" [SpongeBob puts the letter in a bottle, then corks the bottle. Bubble transition to outside the Krusty Krab.] SpongeBob: Patrick, I designed this mechanism specifically to shoot bottles to the surface. The hopes of everyone rests on the success of its maiden voyage. Fire in the hole! [SpongeBob presses it and the bottle shoots up to the surface] Patrick: Santa! Haha. Where's Santa? SpongeBob: Santa doesn't come till Christmas Eve. Mr. Krabs: Okay boy, my demands, uhh, I mean, letter, is ready to go. SpongeBob: Great, Mr. Krabs. What did you wish for? Mr. Krabs: A pony. SpongeBob: Really? Mr. Krabs: With saddle bags full of money! [shoots a bottle up to the surface] Patrick: Here you go, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: What did you wish for, Patrick? Patrick: Another piece of paper. [bottle shoots up to the surface] SpongeBob: And what did you wish for, little girl? Little girl: Front teeth! Cowboy: I could use a new hat! Incidental 22: I need a new hairstyle! Incidental 85: I'd like a glass of water for my teeth. [lots of bottles get shot up to the surface] Squidward: Excuse me, coming through, out of the way. SpongeBob: Great, Squidward, you finished. What's your wish? Squidward: My wish is that the people of Bikini Bottom will stop paying any attention to the inane dribble that is constantly streaming out of this dunderhead's mouth. SpongeBob: Gee, Squidward, maybe Santa will bring me a dictionary so I can understand what you just said. Okay, everybody, we've got a lot to do now that we've summoned Santa Claus. We must ready ourselves for his arrival. Everyone: Hooray! [Bubble transition to the musical number, \"The Very First Christmas\"] SpongeBob and Patrick: [chopping down the coral tree] \u266a It's shaping up to be a wonderful holiday / Not your normal, average, everyday \u266a Squidward: \u266a Sounds like someone felled my old coral tree / SpongeBob, Patrick, why'd you do this to me? \u266a SpongeBob and Patrick: [holding hands and dancing in circles] \u266a The world feels like it's in loverly \u266a Squidward: \u266a Go away before I harm you bodily! \u266a [dumps garbage on SpongeBob and Patrick] SpongeBob and Patrick: \u266a This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas to me. [SpongeBob handles a cart full of Christmas presents, while Patrick uses red and green sleigh bells as his eyes before being covered in snow.] There'll be shopping, decorating, and plenty of snow. \u266a SpongeBob: \u266a Hey, Patrick, who's that under the mistletoe? \u266a Squidward: \u266a What? Who, me? Would you look at the time, I should go! \u266a Plankton: \u266a People seem a little more brotherly \u266a Mr. Krabs: [showing a fruitcake] \u266a Here's a special something to you from me \u266a SpongeBob and Patrick: [as Plankton throws the fruitcake into the trash full of other fruitcakes] \u266a Even all the trash, on Christmas it smells so sweetly. [Gary meows. Patrick covers one of the jellyfish with the container and shakes it to resemble a holiday light.] This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas to me. \u266a [SpongeBob is seen dancing with different Christmas backgrounds, and later outside Squidward's house after opening Squidward's front door while Squidward tries to play puzzles.] SpongeBob: \u266a La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! \u266a Squidward: \u266a What do you want? Can't you see that I'm busy? \u266a SpongeBob and Patrick: [They play and toss the large candy canes, with Patrick swallowing.] \u266a Step outside, we've got something for you to see \u266a [Squidward walks outside to see everything decorated on his house] Squidward: \u266a SpongeBob, take this stuff down immediately! \u266a SpongeBob and Patrick: [two fish at a campfire] \u266a Chestnuts roasting and burns in the third degree \u266a Citizens: \u266a Tonight things are as good as they seem to be! \u266a Patrick: [hurls from the teeter-totter to atop the coral tree] \u266a A star on top will complete all the scenery! \u266a Citizens: \u266a This Christmas feels like [Mr. Krabs sings] the very first Christmas to me! [scene cuts to an unhappy Squidward looking outside from his window] This Christmas feels like [Mr. Krabs sings again] the very first Christmas to me! \u266a [Squidward becomes angry and closes the window blind.] Patchy: Is Squidward right? Can there be a Christmas under the sea? Stay tuned! Whoa! [shaking, putting his hand and hook upon his ears] Patchy: It's about time you got back! Now I can finish me story! So, SpongeBob was sending the last of the letters to Santa... Incidental 37B: I hope he can read Portuguese. SpongeBob: Ah, well, that's the last letter. [gasps] Wait! Squidward hasn't written his letter yet! [runs to Squidward with a pencil, bottles, and paper in hand] Squidward! Hurry! Squidward, Squidward! Hurry! [runs into Squidward's house and upstairs to have him write his letter and passes by him] Squidward: SpongeBob, what are you doing? SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I'll help you get started. [writes letter for Squidward] Dear Santa Claus... Squidward: SpongeBob, forget it. SpongeBob: Right, too formal. Hi Santa... Squidward: SpongeBob, no. SpongeBob: Howdy, Claus? Squidward: [pushes SpongeBob out of his door] I'm not writing a letter to a figment of your imagination. SpongeBob: But, Squidward, when Santa comes, you'll be the only one without a gift. Squidward: SpongeBob, how many times do I have to say it? I don't believe in Santa Claus! SpongeBob: C'mon, Squid, all you have to do is write a letter. What have you got to lose? Squidward: My self-respect. My sanity. My lunch. [closes door] SpongeBob: Squidward, c'mon. [everyone tries to get Squidward outside] Citizens: C'mon, Squidward! Don't be a party pooper! C'mon out! Squidward: [pokes his head out of his window now in his pajamas] Santa Claus is a big phony ! SpongeBob has got you all fooled! Citizens: C'mon, Squidward. C'mon! [closes window and gets in bed] Squidward: Those idiots are gonna be up all night while I get a full night\u2019s sleep. [tries to sleep, but the singing outside wakes him up] Citizens: \u266a Oh, Santa's coming tonight, tonight / Santa's coming tonight / Santa's coming tonight, tonight / Santa's coming tonight \u266a SpongeBob: C'mon everybody! Let's sing till Santa gets here. Citizens: \u266a Santa's coming tonight, tonight / Santa's coming tonight / Santa's coming tonight, tonight / Santa's coming...\u266a [it is then morning and they are tired] Citizens: \u266a Santa's coming tonight, tonight / Santa's coming tonight \u266a Fred: Hey! Where's Santa? SpongeBob: Uh, he should be here any minute. \u266a Santa's coming tonight, tonight / Santa's coming tonight \u266a Citizens: Oh, c'mon. Enough of this. [everyone argues and start to leave] Fred: Thanks for the lies, Mr. Fairytale! Let's go waste our time somewhere else. SpongeBob: Hey, guys, where's your Christmas spirit? He's just running late. Patrick: He probably just stopped for a snack! Fat guys get hungry right? SpongeBob: Yeah! [they wait and wait and then one of the jellyfish jars breaks on SpongeBob's head as the jellyfish floats away] Patrick: Never trust a genie. [Patrick and a snowman walk away] Squidward: [alarm goes off] Ah, morning already? Oh, boy! [speaking in a megaphone] Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas. Wait. Oh, I see a great Christmas photo op. Could you move in a little? [SpongeBob does so] Say Santa Claus. SpongeBob: [very sad face] Santa Claus. [Squidward takes the picture] Squidward: Aww, our first Christmas. \u266aThis Christmas feels like the very first Christmas. The first Christmas is this Christmas. [donkey appears on screen making noises] 'Cause it feels like the first Christmas to me.\u266a [laughs at SpongeBob and hits his butt over and over again] SpongeBob: You were right, Squidward. This is a stupid holiday. [cries; takes out a present] I still want you to have this. Squidward: [stops hitting his butt] What? What's this? SpongeBob: A present. I made it for you so you wouldn't be left out when... [lifts his inelegant blubbering head up] Santa came! [cries some more] Squidward: Oh, gee, I, uh, you know I... SpongeBob: You're welcome. [sadly walks off and cries] Squidward: SpongeBob? He made me a present? It's probably a jellyfish net, or an old Krabby Patty, or... [imitates a hillbilly] his favorite underpants. Haha. Present. [opens the present] Why, it looks like a clarinet. [smells it] It smells like one, too. Handcrafted out of driftwood. And it's even got my name on it. [finds a button that says \"push\"] What's this? [pushes the button and three wooden Squidwards with clarinets come out and bob up and down] Wow. This is the greatest gift I've ever gotten. [sniffles] Oh, I feel like a... I feel like a... I feel like a... [donkey appears on screen and makes noises] big jerk. What have I done to poor SpongeBob? Uh, hey, SpongeBob? I... SpongeBob? [SpongeBob is on a ladder trying to get his lights down] SpongeBob: I guess I won't be needing this. [slides down with the lights in hand] That's better. [a gray cloud comes and rains on SpongeBob] Squidward: The poor little guy. All he wanted was to spread a little joy. SpongeBob: I'd better get this stuff off of Squid's place. Squidward: Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho! SpongeBob: Huh? Hello? Who's there? Huh? Hello? Squidward: Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho! SpongeBob: Hello? Yes. Who's there? Huh? Hello? Show yourself. Yoo-hoo. Hello? Who is it? Huh? Squidward: Up here, you dunce. [dressed like Santa Claus] I mean, uh... Merry Christmas, little boy! SpongeBob: [gasps] C-c-could it be? Squidward: Yes, it is I, Santa Claus. Ho, ho, ho... [slips off the roof and hits the ground] SpongeBob: Hey, you're S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... [takes a deep breath] S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... [takes a deep breath] S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... Squidward: Hey, uh, kid, take it easy. SpongeBob: S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... ta... [faints] Squidward: SpongeBob? SpongeBob? SpongeBob?! SpongeBob: S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... [Squidward covers his mouth] Squidward: Don't do that again. SpongeBob: I knew you'd make it, Santa. Hey, Santa, where's your big, round belly? Squidward: Well, that, um, is a result of, uh, undersea pressure on my body. SpongeBob: Where's your reindeer? And your flying machine? Squidward: Uhh, I loaned them to the Easter Bunny. SpongeBob: And what about that nose? [pokes his nose and laughs] I knew you were supposed to have a big one, but that thing's gigantic. [laughs] Squidward: Alright! I'm Santa. SpongeBob: [jumps onto Squidward] Santa! This is the greatest you could've given me. Thank you for bringing Christmas to Bikini Bottom. Squidward: I didn't bring Christmas to Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob; you did. SpongeBob: I did? [faints and falls on Gary's shell] Gary: Meow. Squidward: Merry Christmas, SpongeBob. Merry Christmas! Whew! I'm glad that's over. Incidental 150: Do you have a present for me, Santa? Squidward: Oh, well, uhh, you see, I'm not really... SpongeBob: [laughs] Go ahead, Santa Claus. See, he is real. He made my Christmas wish come true, he won't let you down. Squidward: Uhh, right, just a second. [searches in his house for something] C'mon, let's see. What do little girls like? A book of matches? Or a shaving kit? A copy of my birth certificate? There's got to be something around here. Think. Think. Think. Ha! Perfect! [hands Incidental 150 a wrench] There you go, little girl! Ho, ho, ho! Incidental 150: Thanks, Santa. [scratches the wrench like it's a puppy] Squidward: That almost felt good. [Squidward then notices a long line of citizens waiting for presents] I didn't... who? Fred: Hey, Santa, where's my present? Old Man Walker: And mine! Incidental 48: And what about me? Squidward: Uhh... let's see what Santa has for all you good people. [searches for stuff in his house] Think fast, Santa. Gifts for good people. [finds a bowl of mashed potatoes in his house] Aha! [gives the bowl to Incidental 22] A bowl of mashed potatoes for you. Incidental 22: Thank you, Santa. This is just what I wanted. [puts bowl on her head] A new hairstyle. [Squidward gives the little girl two forks] Little Girl: Thanks, Santa. [She puts them on like front teeth] Squidward: [gives Patrick a clock] Here you go, Patrick. Patrick: Wow. [punches a hole through the clock] A wrist watch. Incidental 42: Thank you, Santa! Squidward: [gives everything else in his house to the citizens] What was I thinking? I gave away all my stuff just 'cause SpongeBob wouldn't be sad. Am I insane? [SpongeBob knocks on the door] You might as well take the door. It's all that's left. SpongeBob: Squidward! You missed him! He was here just like I said! He gave us all presents. He was jolly and he had a beard. His nose was big and he had rosy cheeks. He was friendly and kind. [turns SpongeBob towards the door and pushes him so he walks] And Santa is... oh, his belly was small, but his nose was huge with Christmas joy. He was so nice Squidward... Squidward: Well, at least it's over. [notices a bottle with a letter in it on the ground] Huh? What's this? Santa: Dear Squidward, thanks for all your help! You've been a real good boy this year. Warm regards, Santa Claus. [letter disappears into thin air] Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho! [in his sleigh flying] Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho, ho. [does a crazy dance while saying his \"ho ho ho\"] Squidward: [Shocked to see Santa does exist and nonchalantly] Yup, I'm insane. [plays his wooden clarinet in the ending tone of the episode] Santa: Merry Christmas! [back at Patchy's house, a sailboat with a homemade Sponge and Pat moves in front of a picture of the island, which has a bunch of presents on it] Patchy: Dee dee, dee dee dee dee. SpongeBob: [as a puppet] Ahoy, Patrick! It's Christmas Island! Patrick: [also a puppet] Presents ahoy! SpongeBob: Hooray! [Patchy starts making storm sound effects] Uh-oh, a storm! Patrick: Yay! I mean yikes! Patchy: [makes more sound effects and begins speaking in his own voice] Oh, we're going down! [He keeps making noises. Zoom out to show the boat is on Patchy's head] Trim the sails! Hoist the yardarms! Turn on the Weather Channel! [he screams] Man on Set: [off-screen] Patchy? Patchy: Oh, hi kids. Boy, that SpongeBob makes me as jolly as a roger. Well, I hope you enjoyed SpongeBob's Christmas tale. And I hope your Christmas is better than sunken treasure. [He takes the boat off his head. Potty flies out, and there is a nest underneath her. In it are a few eggs she laid, wrapped in bows. Patchy picks one up] Aw... Potty left me a little Christmas present. [He laughs. Then he goes over to the mistletoe] Argh, ye old mistletoe. And you know what that means. [he sprays breath freshener in his mouth] Ah, time for somebody to kiss Patchy the Pirate! [he makes kissing noises] Come on, who's it gonna be? Come on! Kiss the captain! [He laughs. Potty flies over and squawks. Patchy screams] Potty: Give us a kiss! [Patchy goes to avoid him] Patchy: No! No, not you! [Potty keeps flying around squawking] No, not you, Potty! Get out of here! No, Potty! I don't wanna kiss you! No, we talked about this. Potty! No! Potty: Kissy, kissy! French Narrator: Well, it looks like Patchy's pretty busy at the moment, so I'll say it for him. Good night, and happy holidays. [The words \"Happy Holidays\" are spelled out on screen] Potty: [squawks] Give me a kiss!"

  "synopsis": [
   "The episode begins on Christmas Eve when Santa is delivering presents. SpongeBob has a gift for him. When Santa comes into his house, he has to shrink himself to fit inside. While he is putting the presents by the Christmas tree, he accidentally kicks his gift under the sofa without realizing it. Seven months later, while SpongeBob is vacuuming his house, he notices that Santa never got the gift. SpongeBob is upset that the gift is 212 days late and tells Patrick about it. They decide to travel to the North Pole. While they are skipping and hopping, they accidentally step on Plankton. They tell Plankton that they are going to the North Pole. Plankton pitches an idea to go to the North Pole to hack into Santa's computer to put his name on the nice list. He wants to do it so Santa will give him Krabby Patty secret formula. He decides to tag along with SpongeBob and Patrick. They travel in Plankton's vehicle and it seemingly takes a day to get there. They end up at Christmas Land Theme Park. They encounter Santa and discover that it is Patchy the Pirate disguising as Santa.Patchy proceeds to tell them they are not at the North Pole but rather a theme park. Plankton admonishes the duo for getting them lost while they realize their error. The three explain that they are trying to find the North Pole and Patchy gives them a map to the North Pole. They eventually all make it to the North Pole. They see Santa's workshop and travel to it. An elf tells them that Santa is on vacation and Plankton goes to Santa's computer to put his name on the nice list. SpongeBob and Patrick cause chaos across the workshop, resulting in a fight. Santa arrives and sees that someone has made a mess. Santa sees SpongeBob and says, \"You're a menace!\" to him. SpongeBob reveals that all he wanted was to deliver the present to him. Santa is delighted by the gesture, as he reveals not even the elves or reindeer give him a present, to their embarrassment. SpongeBob gives Santa a bottle with a letter inside and Plankton thinks it's the Krabby Patty secret formula, but finds out that it isn't. Santa, SpongeBob, the reindeer, and the elves tell Plankton to read the letter. Plankton begrudgingly reads it and it is revealed that it is merely a thank you note to Santa for bringing joy and presents to all. Santa is touched and thanks SpongeBob.Next Christmas, Mr. Krabs has a Christmas party at the Krusty Krab and he gives Plankton some coal. SpongeBob gives Plankton a photo of them with Patchy from their mission to the North Pole. Plankton says that he will destroy everyone with his coal-powered death robot, and he feeds coal to the robot. The episode ends with a shot of the Krusty Krab as everyone can be heard screaming inside while the robot attacks them offscreen."

   "[The episode opens with a shot of Bikini Bottom, where it is snowing, and the town is decorated for Christmas. Cut to inside SpongeBob's house, where SpongeBob is holding a present for Santa. SpongeBob and Gary are wearing Santa hats.] SpongeBob: Ta-dah! This gift is for Santa Claus! [kisses present, then places it under a Christmas tree] Even Santa deserves a gift! Right, Gary? Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: [picks up Gary and spins him, singing to the tune of \"Jingle Bells\"] \u266a Santa Claus, Santa Claus, Santa's on his way! [walking upstairs] I'm giving him a present that he'll take back on his sleigh! \u266a [open shot of his house] Yay! [humming the tune of \"Jingle Bells\"] [Pan up to Santa Claus on his sleigh with his reindeer, flying through the sky.] Santa: Ho, ho, ho! [parks sleigh and approaches SpongeBob's house with a sack] Hmm... [climbs house, trying to fit himself into a pipe, but falls down with it] Oh, yeah, I forgot. [picks up sack] Ho, ho, ho, shrink-o. [sprinkles some dust on him, shrinking him down enough to fit into the pipe] [Humming the tune to \"Jingle Bells,\" Santa enters the house, dancing as he pulls out SpongeBob's present. His butt kicks SpongeBob's present for him out of the way as he continues dancing, putting it behind SpongeBob's sofa. Santa places his gift underneath the tree, and exits SpongeBob's house.] Santa: Ho, ho, ho! [slams door] French Narrator: [narrating time card] Seven months later... [SpongeBob is vacuuming near the sofa, humming.] SpongeBob: Excuse me, Mr. Sofa. [lifts up sofa] Ha, look at that, Gary. Gary: Meow? SpongeBob: It's the present I left for Santa last Christmas. Isn't that nice? [drops vacuum, panicking] The present I left for Santa last Christmas?! [picks up present] He never got it! Oh, this is the worst disaster that's ever happened! Gary: [vocalizing \"uh-oh\"] Meow, meow... SpongeBob: My present to Santa is 212 days later. [begins sobbing] Late, it's a tragedy. [blows nose with present bow] Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: [cradling present] My joyful carefree world is growing dark and dreary! I can't go on! [stops crying] No, I'll go on. [continues crying] But I can't go on! [sobbing] Patrick: [throws roses at SpongeBob, applauding] Whoo-hoo! [whistles] Whoo-hoo! Five stars. SpongeBob: [picking up rose, sniffing it] Patrick, I wasn't acting. Santa never got his Christmas present. Patrick: [shrugs] So why not just deliver it to him? SpongeBob: Why not just deliver it to him? Patrick: [chuckles] That's a dumb idea. [claps] I'm in! SpongeBob: Great! But how will we get there? We can't walk that far. Hmm... Patrick: [squishes face] Oh, we can push and shove each other! SpongeBob: Great idea! We can't let it be [picks up present] one more day late. [opens himself and puts the present inside] Okay, me first. [Patrick shoves SpongeBob ahead, making him roll out of the house. Patrick runs after him, both laughing.] Patrick: My turn! [SpongeBob shoves him, making him roll on the road] Bystander: What the-- SpongeBob: [running after Patrick] Merry Christmas! [laughs] Bystander: Um, it's July? [Cut to the Chum Bucket, where Plankton opens the doors and comes out.] Plankton: Ah, it's a good day to be bad. [inhales, then exhales] Huh? [gets crushed by a landing SpongeBob] SpongeBob: [gets up, laughing] Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob? [points to him] You got a booger. SpongeBob: [looks at Plankton on his nose] Oh! [eyes dart back and forth] Patrick: Don't worry, [pulls tissue from armpit] that's what friends are for. [puts tissue up to SpongeBob's nose] Blow. SpongeBob: [blows into tissue] Thank you. Patrick: [looking inside tissue] Eww! [turns tissue around] It's the ugliest booger I've ever seen. Plankton: [escapes tissue] Can't you screwballs walk without falling? SpongeBob: Sorry, Plankton. [using hand gestures to demonstrate] We're pushing and shoving ourselves all the way to the North Pole. I have to give Santa his Christmas present. [rolls himself up to reveal present] Plankton: Santa? I hate that guy. He's had me on a naughty list ever since I got this tattoo. [rolls up arm, revealing tattoo that says \"Born to be Naughty\"] SpongeBob and Patrick: Born to be naughty? Plankton: Whoo! Wait a minute. [pacing] If I can break into Santa's lair, hack his mainframe, change my status from naughty to nice, I could ask [antennae twist] for the Krabby Patty secret formula and he'd have to give it to me. I'm coming with you. Patrick: [raised hands] Pushed or shoved? Plankton: Shrimp that! [holds remote, pushing a button] We are going in style, babies. [The Chum Bucket's garage door opens, revealing a snow plow-like vehicle with a fish tank.] SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa! Plankton: I built it to fly and run over bodies during the zombie apocalypse, but it'll work on snow too. [Bubble transition to Plankton in the vehicle, setting up the GPS.] Plankton: We'll take the Pacific to the Arctic, then over ice and snow to the North Pole. Easy-peasy, Santa-squeezy. [chuckles, then sees SpongeBob and Patrick laughing in their seats] Plankton: [unamused] Seat belts. [puts on seat belt] SpongeBob: Of course, [puts on seat belt] safety first. All secured, Captain Plankton. Patrick: [stretches pants onto his body] All secured. Plankton: [groans] I'm already regretting this trip. [Plankton hits a button on the control panel that says \"BLAST OFF!\", and the vehicle takes off, leaving flames behind. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Plankton are smashed against their seats due to the speed.] SpongeBob: Whee! [laughs] Patrick: Ya-hoo! Mr. Krabs: [humming as he walks to the Krusty Krab, then screams as he notices the vehicle] [Mr. Krabs runs away from the vehicle as it drives past the Krusty Krab. He then peeks from behind the Krusty Krab. Plankton tries to reach for the steering bars, but fails. The vehicle jumps over some hills, then Plankton successfully grabs the steering bars and pulls them back, making the vehicle fly into the air.] Plankton: We did it! [looks away] Hmm? SpongeBob: [looking down at the kids at a playground waving at them] Oh, look at those tiny little fish. SpongeBob and Patrick: [waving] Hi! Plankton: Hey, [points] get back to your seats! Patrick: [points upwards] The seat belt sign is off. Plankton: [looks above to see the seat belt sign turn off, and groans] Farmer: [looking up at the flying vehicle, gasps, runs away] The visitors, they're here! SpongeBob: [looking outside with Patrick] He seemed happy to see us. Oh! [sees a fish sitting in a floating lawn chair held by balloons, as he sips his tea] Ah! Patrick: Whoa, a flying lawn chair. Plankton: [rolls eye] [The scene turns to nighttime. Plankton stretches himself and cracks his neck. SpongeBob breathes on his present and wipes it with a cloth. Plankton jumps up to snatch the gift.] SpongeBob: Hey! Plankton: Give me that. [shakes present] What's in this box anyway? SpongeBob: It's a surprise. [takes back present, twists his eye like a combination lock, and puts the present back inside himself] Plankton: I hope it's a stink bomb for that pot-bellied jingle joker. SpongeBob: Santa is not pot-bellied. He just suffers from seasonal bloating. Plankton: [waves and walks off] Right. [walks to a bed] I'm going to sleep. SpongeBob: [gesturing to vehicle] But who will fly this thing? Plankton: [in bed] I put it on automatic pilot. You and that pink moron can sleep on the floor. [Patrick is snoring on a newspaper bed. SpongeBob takes out his present and uses it as a pillow, and takes one of Patrick's newspapers to use as a blanket. Plankton claps twice to make the light go out. Cut to a first-person view of Plankton, who wakes up to see SpongeBob and Patrick in the front seats.] Plankton: Hey, what are you imbeciles doing? SpongeBob: We found the North Pole. Patrick: It was way closer than you said. Plankton: North Pole? Impossible. [looks outside] How long was I asleep? Patrick: [as vehicle approaches the ground] Funny how the ground keeps getting closer. [The vehicle bumps into a sign that says \"Christmas Land Theme Park,\" and a branch falls off.] Speaker: [on sign] Welcome to Christmas Land Theme Park. Where every day is Christmas. Plankton: [jumping onto control panel, pointing to Patrick] Hey, get out of my seat. [both look up to see the seat belt icon come back on] Patrick: The seat belt sign is on. [grabs Plankton and straps a seat belt to him in a seat, choking him] Cabin crew, prepare for landing! [starts pressing random buttons] Plankton: [afraid] Do you actually know how to land? Patrick: I know how to crash land. [Patrick tugs on the steering bars, making the vehicle do flips in the air as it begins nosediving.] Plankton: [grabbing onto seat belt] My seat belt! [gets stuck inside seat] [The vehicle stops nosediving and starts to land, and lightly taps on a pole, causing a giant explosion. SpongeBob and Patrick uncover their eyes and look up to see a \"North Pole\" sign.] SpongeBob and Patrick: The North Pole! SpongeBob: [off-screen] We made it! Plankton: [on windshield, groans, sliding off] Huh? [points to busted navigation system] Look what you two broken brain buffoons did! You completely destroyed the navigation system. Patrick: You're welcome. SpongeBob: Don't be mad, [puts fingers in Plankton's mouth to make him smile] Plankton. We're here. [Plankton's mouth flops downwards. Bubble transition to the trio outside in water helmets.] SpongeBob: Look at all this. [he and Patrick laugh as they run across the snow, looking at their surroundings] Plankton: [concerned] Hmm. SpongeBob: [giggles, looks at garden gnomes] Ooh, Santa's elves! Patrick: [both gasp, looks at taxidermy deer] Santa's reindeer! SpongeBob and Patrick: This is amazing! Plankton: Something's wrong here. It isn't even cold. And look at this smog. Patrick: [looks at the sky] It's snow and smog? SpongeBob: It's \"snog.\" [both laugh, bang their heads together, and wander off] Plankton: [sighs and groans] [With Patrick nearby, SpongeBob hops onto an empty box to look inside a building window.] SpongeBob: Santa's workshop! [Patrick hops onto the box] [Inside the building, there are toy elves \"making\" toys on a conveyor belt.] Toy elves: \u266a Making toys, work, work, work! Making toys, work, work, work! \u266a SpongeBob: [bangs on window] Hello, Santa's elves, I'm SpongeBob! Merry Christmas! Toy elves: [distorted voices] Make, work-- [one of their heads falls off, and another breaks it with a hammer] make, work-- Plankton: [unamused, SpongeBob frowns] Looks like Santa's gone all in for automation. SpongeBob: Hey guys, look! [approaching sign on post] It says, [gasps] \"meet Santa Claus!\" [brief shot of the Santa Claus house up ahead, starts taking off] Come on, guys! [giggles] Patrick: [running after SpongeBob] Let's meet Santa! Plankton: [walking and grunting] [Plankton climbs up a step and arrives to the front of the building. SpongeBob and Patrick are already there, with SpongeBob holding his present.] SpongeBob: We're finally here, little present. [all start walking] Plankton: Guys, I hate to say this, but this place is a sham. I don't know why, but we're being tricked. SpongeBob: Oh, Plankton, Christmas is about believing. Patrick: Yeah, Christmas is about bleeding, man. [SpongeBob and Patrick look down a messy corridor to see a snoring Santa.] SpongeBob and Patrick: [gasp, look at each other, then run to Santa giggling] Plankton: I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eye. The bearded weirdo in the flesh. [SpongeBob and Patrick jump onto Santa's legs. They both start giggling at him, then look at each other.] Santa: [waking up] What would you like for Christmas? SpongeBob and Patrick: [both speaking at once] SpongeBob: [overlapping Patrick's gibberish] Oh, besides peace on earth, I'd like a new luxury three-story shelf for Gary, a lifetime supply of ice cream for Patrick, and... Santa: Pipe down, children. [first person view of him focusing his eyes on Patrick and SpongeBob] What the-- [gasps] SpongeBob SquarePants? SpongeBob: [waving] Hi, Santa. Santa: Did you know that I'm your biggest fan? SpongeBob: Oh, that's very sweet of you Santa, but actually Patchy the Pirate is my biggest fan. Santa: Ho, ho, ho! [Santa takes his head off to reveal he is actually Patchy the Pirate.] Patchy: Ahoy, SpongeBob and Patrick! It's me, Patchy the Pirate. [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp before their heads disintegrate into confetti.] SpongeBob: Patchy the Pirate? You're Santa? Patchy: No, I just play Santa here in Christmas Land Theme Park. [chuckles] It's me side-hustle. Plankton: Heh. I knew this wasn't the North Pole. Patchy: North Pole? No, man, this be Encino. You're almost 4,000 miles from the North Pole. Plankton: [growls, hops onto chair] I'm gonna destroy you two! [crosses arms] SpongeBob: 4,000 miles? Oh, if only our GPS wasn't busted. Patchy: Ooh, I can help with [pulls out map] global positioning. Way before GPS, pirates used these things called maps . [rolls up map and gives it to SpongeBob] Oh, and you'll need a compass too. Potty: [squawks, carrying compass] Happy holidays. [drops compass onto Plankton, crushing him, laughs with Patchy] Plankton: [raising fist] Polly want a smacker? SpongeBob: Well, thanks, Patchy. Guess we'll be on our way. [he, Patrick, and Plankton leave] Patchy: Goodbye! Good luck. If you see Santy Claus, tell him I want a new parrot. Potty: [squawks, pecking Patchy on the head] Patchy: Hey! Potty: And I want a new pirate. [A map of the United States is shown, with Encino labelled on it. A dotted line extends from Encino and into an oil silo. A drop of red ink falls from the silo and continues along the map, and into an alligator near Florida.] Plankton: [echoed voice] Wait, where are we? [All three scream as the red ink dot is spat out by the alligator onto a different part of the map. It goes into a trapdoor and out another one, gets carried by a tornado, goes next to a lumberjack moose, which kicks the dot to the North Pole, where it cuts to the vehicle finally arriving. Plankton is in an ice block, shivering.] Plankton: [shivering] S-S-Santa's workshop, dead ahead. SpongeBob: [now icy and blue, shivering] J-j-just in time. I'm f-f-freezing. Patrick: [now blue, tired] Are we there yet? [eyes crumble from his face] [The vehicle finally arrives at a building in the North Pole. SpongeBob and Patrick get out, and Patrick is licking Plankton stuck in an ice block.] SpongeBob: How you doing with that Plankton pop? Patrick: I can't wait to get to the chewy middle. [close-up of Plankton in the ice block] Plankton: [groaning] [They stand on the welcome mat, and SpongeBob gets excited.] SpongeBob: Hey Patrick, where's Plankton? Patrick: [shrugs] I don't know. Plankton: [opens Patrick's mouth and escapes, putting his helmet back on] [points at Patrick] Eat a breath mint, trench mouth. SpongeBob: All right, here it goes. [knocks on door] Female elf: [opens door] Huh? [looks down] Aw, you guys look great! I like your spaceman helmets. But it's not Halloween for another three months. SpongeBob: [shakes head] We're not here for Halloween, we're here for Santa. [Patrick nods] Plankton: I've got my own agenda so this is where we part company. [puts on elf hat and begins walking] Female elf: Oh, sorry, Santa's not home. He's in Aruba with the Missus. But... [gives SpongeBob and Patrick candy canes] here you go anyway. Patrick: [eats candy cane, which makes him dazed] SpongeBob: [bites candy cane] But--but-- Female elf: Happy Halloween! [slams door] SpongeBob and Patrick: [notice something] Huh? [In the window, figures are seen partying inside the building. Patrick climbs up on the window, and they both peek inside to see the elves partying.] SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa! SpongeBob: [gasps] [Inside, Plankton tries to dodge the dancing elves. He gets kicked into the air and gets back up with a black eye.] SpongeBob: Hey, that's Plankton. He's inside. Patrick: Hmm? SpongeBob: [knocks on window glass] Plankton: Eh? [sticks tongue out] Bleh. [walks off] Jeez. SpongeBob: I have to get Santa's present under his tree. We've got to get inside. Patrick: [eyes turn into lightbulbs] Ah! I'm on it! [runs off] SpongeBob: Hmm, I know! We'll go in Santa style. [gestures downward] Down the chimney. Patrick: [driving a wrecking crane] Oh, fine, we'll go with your idea. [Cut back to Plankton, who is walking by some stables.] Plankton: Hmm, now where in Kris Kringle is Santa's mainframe? [He sees some muscular reindeer working out inside a room.] Plankton: [continues walking] No mainframe, just lame brains. [stops before Santa's workshop as he hears a reindeer talk to him] Bludolph: Yo, where do you think you're going? Plankton: [high-pitched] Who, me? I'm just a little elf! Bludolph: [sniffs] You don't smell like no elf. Plankton: Oh, yeah? What's it to you, [kicks snow into reindeer's face] you moose? Bludolph: [snorts] Hey! Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen! Plankton: [whimpers as the reindeer surround him] Well, looks like we got a whole Christmas special here. [gets picked up by Bludolph] Whoa! Bludolph: Ready for some reindeer games? Plankton: Eh, peace on earth? [the reindeer begin to kick him around] Whoa! Oof, oof, ow! That better be mud on your hooves. Whoa! [Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick arrive inside the workshop's chimney.] SpongeBob: [gasps as he notices a Christmas tree up ahead] That's it! Santa's Christmas tree. [both giggle as they laugh and run to the tree, until a spotlight shines on them as an alarm goes off] Female elf: [opens door, with other elves, angry] There they are! It's the trick-or-treaters! Male elf: Toy thieves! Other male elf: Christmas crooks! Get 'em! [all run inside] Patrick: [scared] SpongeBob, what do we do? SpongeBob: [panicking] Climb! [both start climbing up the tree] Female elf: [all under tree] They're going up the tree! Don't let 'em get away! [Bludolph notices the alarm outside Santa's Workshop.] Bludolph: We better check that alarm! [gestures inside as the other reindeer enter, all trampling Plankton] Plankton: [gets up, taking off elf outfit, walking weakly inside] I wore you down, didn't I? Yeah. You meat head cari-boobs. [The reindeer arrive at the scene, where the elves are throwing things at SpongeBob and Patrick. Male elf: Toy thieves! [A toy duck hits Patrick, who is hanging onto a garland on the tree. Another toy flies past Bludolph's head.] Bludolph: Yo, elves! What the Father Christmas is going on here? Female elf: We got this under control. Go back to your stables. [throws Rubik's cube at the tree, breaking an ornament] [The elves continue throwing things, and some even climb the tree.] Reindeer: [gets hit with a toy truck, rubs head] Oh! Not cool, elf bros. [picks up another toy truck and throws it at an elf, which hits him and falls onto his head] Other female elf: [growls, then swings from a garland and shouts] Reindeer: [ducks, dodging the elf] Whoa! [The female elf crashes into a wall, leaving behind a giant crack. She falls down and Lego pieces fall onto the ground.] Reindeer: [laughs] Male elf: Hey! [points to reindeer with wooden stake] Not funny. [throws stake, which the reindeer dodges] [The reindeer leaps onto the ceiling fan, and begins spinning] Whoa, whoa! [crushes several elves as he lands, and a toy train comes by to crush his snout] SpongeBob: [looking down] Oh, no, Patrick. It looks like I have sowed the seeds of discontent in the house of Santa. [sees Patrick] Patrick? Huh? Patrick: [dazed, reaching for candy cane on the tree] Candy cane...oh! SpongeBob: [gasps as he notices an elf climbing the tree] Oh... [throws ornament at elf, which breaks on his face] Male elf: [unfazed, cackles, continues climbing] Plankton: [walking by the chaos, and almost gets stepped on by a reindeer, groans] [gasps, seeing Santa's mainframe] Santa's mainframe. I found it! [runs towards it, and begins typing his name on the computer] Thanks to those two idiots causing a distraction, I did it. [wipes hands, walking away] My name is on the nice list. [jumps back down and begins walking away] Now I just gotta be good for the next few months. How hard could that be. He-he-he-- [gets stepped on by Santa] wah! Santa: [in a summer outfit] Oh! What the [raises sunglasses] ho, ho, ho is going on here? [the elves and reindeer look at him] I was kicking back with the Missus in the Caribbean when my silent alarm went off. [The female elf points to the tree, where the male elf from earlier chuckles as he is right next to SpongeBob on a branch.] Male elf: [noticing Santa] Huh? [smiles at Santa] SpongeBob: [waving] Hi, Santa. Santa: SpongeBob? Ho, ho, I should've known! [points to SpongeBob] You're a menace. SpongeBob: [laughs, jumps down onto Santa's hand and pulls out the present] All I wanted to do was leave you this present that you didn't get last Christmas. 213 days late. Sorry! Santa: A present is never too late. Oh, how sweet. Not even the elves or reindeer get me presents. [The elves and reindeer look at each other awkwardly.] Santa: Thank you, SpongeBob. [takes present] Should I open it now? SpongeBob: [jumps onto Santa's shoulder, nodding] Uh-huh, uh-huh! [Santa pops open the present, and grabs the secret formula. The reindeer and elves gasp.] SpongeBob: [off-screen] It's one of a kind. Plankton: [with bottle of glue to fix his helmet, then gasps] The Krabby Patty secret formula? He's giving it to Santa Claus! Forget the list, the formula's right here. I could have it now! [laughing as he climbs up Santa] Santa: [looks down] Huh? Plankton: [jumps and grabs the formula, landing on the nearby table] Santa: Huh? Plankton? [points to him] You're being naughty. Plankton: Santa, [flexes bicep with \"Born to be Naughty\" tattoo] I was born to be naughty. Santa and SpongeBob: [gasp, then grunt] Plankton: [pulls out paper and laughs, muttering as he reads it, then rolls it back up] Um, yeah... [holds out paper] you can have this back. My bad, heh. I mean, good--my good. I'm being nice, not naughty. Santa: Well, read it out loud. Plankton: Uh, that's okay. Santa: Go on, read it. Reindeer and elves: Read it! Plankton: [reading] \"Dear Santa, there isn't a present big enough to express how much joy you've brought to all the children and sea creatures of the world. So this is just a simple thank you note. Thank you. Signed, with love, your pal SpongeBob.\" [The reindeer and elves coo, and Bludolph has an elf in a headlock.] Plankton: You got a typo here. Santa: [tearing up] Oh, how touching. [wipes tear] This is beautiful. Thank you, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: I wouldn't have made it here without the help of [gestures to Plankton] Plankton. He's really not that naughty. And of course, my best friend Patrick. Patrick? Patrick: [dazed, holding some candy canes with his water helmet off] Happy holidays to me! French Narrator: [reading time card] The next Christmas. [Cut to the Krusty Krab decorated for the holidays in the snowy winter. The customers are giving each other presents as Mr. Krabs walks out of the office with Santa hats on his eye stalks, holding a present.] Woman: Aww, here you go! Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Happy holidays, everybody. [gives present to Plankton] Sheldon. Plankton: [opens present and pulls out a lump of coal] Lump of coal. [tosses coal lump into a giant pile of it] SpongeBob: [placing another present next to Plankton] Merry Christmas, Plankton. Plankton: Another lump of coal, no doubt. [opens present and pulls out a letter] What's this? [reading note with a picture of Patchy holding him, Patrick, and SpongeBob] \"Merry Christmas to Plankton! One day you will destroy us all.\" Yes, I will, SpongeBob. Yes, I will. [cackles, then grabs a shovel to scoop up the coal to put into a giant robot] Destroy! Robot: [roars, releasing fire] [Cut to an open shot of the Krusty Krab.] Plankton: [off-screen as the windows flash red] Ho, ho, ho! [cackles, everyone else screams as the camera pans upwards]"

  "synopsis": [
   "As the special begins, Patchy the Pirate (parodying the role of S.D. Kluger from Santa Claus is Comin' to Town) drives a mail truck through a snowy mountain range. He stops to wish the viewers a Merry Christmas and tells them he wanted to make sure Santa Claus got his letter. He then lies saying he gave the mailman the day off, he really stole the truck and the mailman is tied up in the back.Potty the Parrot doubts they will make it to the North Pole, then argues with Patchy about which Christmas carol the directions to the North Pole are in. The truck is driven madly until Potty notices there is literally a fork in the road, which gets stuck in one of the tires and causes the truck to spin madly. Patchy then suggests that they see what SpongeBob is doing for the holidays.Patchy drives the truck off a cliff and the mailman escapes. He and Potty get lost in the woods (since the fork got stuck in one of the truck's tires and caused it to go flat, preventing them from being able to drive it any further) and are trying to warm up by a fire. Out of a sense of hunger, Patchy hallucinates and imagines Potty as a platter of buffalo wings. Patchy nearly eats his pet, only to snap out of it. Potty then also hallucinates and imagines Patchy's head as a suet cake topped with birdseed and pecks at it.At the end of the episode, Patchy and Potty make it to the North Pole, believing they finally made it to Santa's workshop. Patchy apparently meets Santa in a cave and tells him his Christmas wish is to meet SpongeBob. However, it turns out he was, once again, hallucinating and really encountered a hungry polar bear, which started chasing him. Watching nearby, the real Santa puts Patchy on the naughty list for stealing a mail truck. They both wish the viewers a Merry Christmas.Set to December 23, SpongeBob is really excited that Christmas is almost here. SpongeBob sees his friends are preparing for Christmas as well. Squidward is stringing lights so Santa knows to \"go away.\" Patrick has set a trap for Santa to make him stop the clocks so they will have Christmas all year long (but he gets trapped in his own trap). Sandy is conducting a Christmas scientific experiment. Mr. Krabs is ready for the season of \"getting.\" Meanwhile, Plankton is not happy, as he gets nothing but coal in his stocking every year, so he comes up with a new plan to ruin the holidays which involves the new element he recently discovered: a large green glowing chunk of what he dubs Jerktonium (Jt). His plan is to give out fruitcakes to everyone in town, each piece spiked with Jerktonium so that anyone who eats it will become a jerk. With everyone except him acting like a jerk, Santa will have no other choice but to put him on his nice list and give what he always wanted to get for Christmas: the Krabby Patty secret formula.Driving a fruitcake dispenser car called the \"Jerkmaker-9000,\" Plankton wonders who will be his first victim when SpongeBob shows up. After feeding him a piece of fruitcake and seeing that he did not become a jerk, Plankton thinks he got a piece that did not have Jerktonium, so he feeds SpongeBob more slices, then whole loaves, and even a baker's dozen, but there is still no effect. His plan having seemingly failed yet again, Plankton tosses SpongeBob the keys to the cake dispenser before kicking it and heading back into the Chum Bucket irritatedly. Driving the fruitcake dispenser up to a trio of Christmas carolers, SpongeBob gives them each a piece of fruitcake. Upon consuming it, they get enveloped in a green aura, grow five o'clock shadows and burly eyebrows, and begin arguing about which song to sing. Thinking they are just being passionate about the holidays, SpongeBob drives off to find more people to pass the fruitcake out to. Plankton, hearing the racket, comes out of the Chum Bucket and sees the carolers arguing, much to his delight. The Jerktonium works after all! Getting on a unicycle, Plankton follows after SpongeBob to see him unwittingly carry out his scheme.Coming up to a Christmas parade in town, SpongeBob starts tossing fruitcake to everyone present: the spectators, the parade Santa, and even the driver of the parade float, totally unaware of the transformation everyone is undergoing. Plankton is pleased that soon, everyone in town will be jerks, except SpongeBob.Consulting Karen, Plankton discovers that SpongeBob's extreme purity-of-heart and innocent love of the Christmas holidays shields his heart from the effects of the Jerktonium, thereby making him immune. Knowing that SpongeBob still being on the nice list would likely ruin his plan, Plankton is forced to unleash \"Plan B\": an evil wind-up robot clone of SpongeBob, named \"ToyBob,\" to destroy Bikini Bottom and ruin SpongeBob's good name. The robot begins its campaign of naughtiness by throwing a boat into a building and trapping Mr. Krabs inside the Krusty Krab by burning down its sign.Later that day, as he returns from feeding fruitcake to everyone in Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob crosses paths with the carolers, who bad-mouth him. As SpongeBob passes the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs is (cheaply) fixing the sign, Mr. Krabs says that the repairs are coming out of his salary, thinking SpongeBob had destroyed the sign. Then he sees Patrick, who also became a jerk by setting another trap for Santa and tells SpongeBob to leave before falling in it again. The next morning, it's Christmas Eve, SpongeBob finally notices that everyone is being mean. Afraid that Santa might fly by Bikini Bottom, he asks Squidward for help, but Squidward (the only one in town who did not eat Jerktonium) claims he is not home, which SpongeBob immediately falls for and decides to go see Sandy on Squidward's suggestion. Right after SpongeBob leaves, ToyBob knocks (or more specifically, bumps) Squidward's door, and when he (still angrily) refuses to let ToyBob in, he grabs the door and smashes it on Squidward's head after he furiously demands ToyBob the door back.Meanwhile, SpongeBob goes to Sandy's treedome to explain, but she is also a jerk. SpongeBob accidentally drops some fruitcake Sandy had been eating into her Christmas Magic Analyzer, which shows that it is contaminated with Jerktonium. Sandy asks where SpongeBob got it from, and he answers Plankton. Sandy asks again in disbelief that he would take the fruit cake from the known-to-be evil Plankton and just hand it out to people without suspicion, to which SpongeBob stupidly says \"uh-huh.\" Sandy then calls him an idiot and explains to him that his foolish actions have caused the whole town to act mean; this causes SpongeBob to understand and get worried since he ate tons of Jerktonium. After discovering from a scan that SpongeBob is immune to Jerktonium, Sandy notes everyone else needs an antidote, Sandy sets her analyzer to come up with one. However, she cannot make sense of the formula notes. SpongeBob realizes that it is actually a music sheet. After SpongeBob recites some of the notes, Sandy instantly returns to normal, making SpongeBob realize the song is the antidote.Getting to the center of town, where everyone is having a riot, SpongeBob begins singing the song \"Don't Be a Jerk.\" One by one, all the Bikini Bottomites become good and respectful again as they sing along with Squidward later joining in.With everyone else back to normal in not a moment too soon, Santa comes down from the sky on his sleigh. SpongeBob excitedly greets Santa, however, he is afraid to say that he is the bearer of bad tidings: everyone in town is on the naughty list this year and everyone will get coal, except Plankton, much to everyone else's shock. Santa states that he is just as surprised as them, but compared to everyone else, Plankton has been a saint. Much to Mr. Krabs' astonishment, Santa gives Plankton the Krabby Patty formula as his present. Pearl then directs Mr. Krabs' attention to the elves who are in the process of picking his wallet from his pocket, making Mr. Krabs swat them away.Stunned to see that his attempt to save Christmas has failed, SpongeBob tries to explain to Santa that he has it all wrong, but he refuses to listen by saying that SpongeBob (on the contrary) is the worst of all, believing that he is still wreaking havoc in Bikini Bottom.At that moment, ToyBob arrives (with Plankton realizing he made a huge mistake) and, upon spotting Santa, carries out his programming to destroy Christmas by morphing into a larger form and eliminating him. SpongeBob tries to protect Santa, but is easily defeated when the robot throws him far away. Santa tries to hide in the Krusty Krab, but ToyBob captures him. SpongeBob saves Santa by using the fruitcake-dispenser to shoot fruitcake at it, clogging its vent holes and causing it to fail. SpongeBob manages to get Santa to safety just before ToyBob explodes into pieces. Santa thanks SpongeBob for saving him and tells him that he has been indeed a very good lad, unlike the \"owner of ToyBob.\" One of the elves gives Santa ToyBob's key, which is inscribed with \"If found, please return to the Chum Bucket,\" revealing to Santa that Plankton was responsible for all the trouble, enraging him. With that, Plankton attempts to escape with the Krabby Patty formula, only be stopped by Mr. Krabs, who calmly tells him to hand over his secret formula without making the situation become more worse. Mr. Krabs takes back the formula, tosses Plankton to Santa's Sleigh and Santa has the elves dump coals on Plankton as punishment for his actions, much to Plankton's dismay. Santa then leaves everyone to celebrate the rest of the holidays (except Squidward). SpongeBob, looking around, asks if anyone has seen Patrick. The special then ends by showing Patrick on the back of Santa's sleigh and netting him, throwing him and the reindeer off course."

   "[A mail truck drives through a mountain range. Patchy the Pirate is driving the truck. He appears to be parodying S.D. Kluger from the song \"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town.\"] Patchy: Merry Christmas, kids! I bet you're wondering why ol' Patchy has this mail truck. Well, this year, I wanted to be absolutely sure Santa got me letter, so I gave Mr. Mailman the day off. [He puts his pirate hat on\u00a0the mailman tied up and gagged in the back of the truck, puts on his mailman hat\u00a0and closes the door] Potty: Do you even know how to get to the North Pole? Patchy: Oh, Potty, you silly parrot. Everyone knows that the directions to the North Pole are in the lyrics of the song \"Jingle Bells.\" \u266aDashing through the snow, in a... [Mumbles] Through the fields we go. Fa la la la la.\u266a Okay. So we're looking for some fields here. Potty: No, Patchy, the directions to the North Pole are in the song, \"There Goes Santa Claus.\" \u266aThere goes Santa Claus. There goes Santa\u00a0Claus. Left on Santa Claus Drive.\u266a Scurvy brain. Patchy: Yeah, well, we ain't turnin' till we see some fields. Potty: Look out! There's a fork in the road! Patchy: I don't see no fork. [The truck spins after the fork gets caught in the tire and they both scream.] Patchy: While we wait for the truck to stop spinning, let's see what SpongeBob is up to this Christmas. [The camera zooms in on Bikini Bottom and into SpongeBob's pineapple house. SpongeBob and Gary are sleeping. SpongeBob's alarm clock goes off and sleigh bells are heard instead of the foghorn noise. SpongeBob wakes up.] SpongeBob: \u266aOh, it's drawing very near.\u00a0My favorite time of the year. [He jumps\u00a0out of\u00a0bed and up the ladder] The snow is falling and the cold wind blows. [He gets up on the diving board, and jumps on it] Christmas is almost here. [He jumps up, automatically removing his pajamas and changing into his square pants] And I know that Santa, Santa. Santa has his jolly little eyes on me! [He spins Christmas lights around his pineapple] It keeps me warm and filled with glee to know Santa has his eyes on me. I light my house like a Christmas tree. Fa la la la la la la la lee. 'cause Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little... [A\u00a0Santa hat pops out of SpongeBob's head] Eyes on me.\u266a [He walks over to Squidward's house where Squidward is putting up lights] SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! What are you doing today? Squidward: Stringing lights so Santa knows, in no uncertain terms... [Turns the lights on, which say \"GO AWAY\"] ...to\u00a0go away! SpongeBob: Okay... [Skips up to Patrick next to a box on a stick tied with string to a cookie] \u266aSanta, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me. He sees everything I do, with his left eye on me and his right eye on you!\u266a [sees the box] Ooh, what's that? Patrick: It's a trap! A trap for Santa! SpongeBob: Ooh. Baited with Christmas treats? Patrick: [in the tune of \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\"] \u266aI will trap Santa in my box, locked up like Fort Knox and make him stop the clocks. And we'll have Christmas all year long!\u266a Hey, a cookie! [Patrick goes for the cookie and the box traps him.] SpongeBob: \u266aOhh... Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me! Fa la la la la la la la la lee! [sees Sandy's treedome] And who is that I see? Underneath her Christmas tree?\u266a Sandy: \u266aOh, Christmas, oh, Christmas its sweet mystery. I'll mix a dash of Christmas cheer with a candy cane and deconstructed alchemy.\u266a SpongeBob: Merry Christmas, Sandy! Sandy: Merry Christmas, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob skips to the Krusty Krab] SpongeBob: \u266aSanta, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me.\u266a Hi, Mr. Krabs! Are you ready for Christmas? Mr. Krabs: Why, Christmas is me favorite time of the year! After all, 'tis the season of gettin'! SpongeBob: Don't you mean the season of giving? Mr. Krabs: Exactly! The more you give, the more I get. [Laughs] Plankton: \u266aOh, Santa, Santa, Santa has his eye on me. He's seen everything I've done. Every plot, plan, and scheme. It's just a bit of fun. Santa has his eye on me. Every naughty deed is written in his scroll. So every Christmas morning, I get a stocking full of coal!\u266a [Dumps out coal from his stocking] Karen: Maybe you'd get a real present from Santa if you weren't the biggest jerk in Bikini Bottom. Plankton: I'm way ahead of you, Karen! [Periodic Table lowers from ceiling. Plankton walks over to it and sticks a piece of notepad paper on it. The paper says Jt for\u00a0Jerktonium] There is one element in the known universe that can turn even the nicest sap into the biggest jerk they can be! And I, Plankton have discovered it. Behold! [Plankton pulls a lever] Jerktonium! [A piece of Jerktonium contained in a glass capsule lowers from the ceiling] I'll give everyone in Bikini Bottom a present of the most innocent of all holiday goodies. The fruitcake! [picture of a fruitcake appears on screen while he says the fruitcake] And each and every slice will be laced with Jerktonium! Once ingested, no one can help becoming the biggest, creepiest, meanest jerk ever! Then Santa will realize that Sheldon J. Plankton isn't so bad after all! And then I'll finally get what I really want for Christmas, the Krabby Patty secret formula! [Plankton jumps on an oven and holds the fruitcake] And now for the main ingredient, Jerktonium! Okay, Jerktonium, do your stuff! It's complete! [Laughs] Ha ha! The Jerkmaker 9000 will make doling out tainted fruitcake a breeze! Now, who's gonna be my first victim? SpongeBob: Hey, Plankton! What've you got there? [Gasps] Hey! Is that a fruitcake dispenser? You don't suppose I could have a piece, do ya? Plankton: Sure thing, fruitcake! Here you go! [Presses button on the dispenser\u00a0as a robotic\u00a0arm gives SpongeBob a fruitcake!] Plankton: Hot from the oven and full in lovin'! SpongeBob: Ooh! Ooh! Hot! Hot! Hot! [Sighs as he takes a bite] Wow! This is great! Plankton: So, how do you feel, kinda cranky? SpongeBob: No. Plankton: Sorta surly? SpongeBob: Mm-mm. Plankton: Maybe just a little bit jerky? SpongeBob: No. I feel just how this cake tastes! Absolutely delicious! Plankton: Hmm... He must have gotten a piece without Jerktonium! Here. Try some more. SpongeBob: Don't mind if I do! [He eats the fruitcake] Plankton: How's your dander? Is it up? SpongeBob: No. How could I possibly be angry when my taste buds are swimming in Christmas cheer? [He takes another piece; cut to inside of his mouth] Taste Bud: Oh, boy, here comes some more! Yaaaay! Plankton: Grrr! Have some more! [He fires a piece into SpongeBob's mouth] Have a whole loaf! [The arm stuffs a loaf into SpongeBob's mouth] Have a baker's dozen! [He fires 15 fruitcakes into SpongeBob's mouth] Well? SpongeBob: Well \u2026 [He swallows] I think everyone should taste your amazing fruitcake! Plankton: You know what? Knock yourself out. [He throws SpongeBob the keys to the dispenser] Stupid hunk of junk -tonium! My gift to Bikini Bottom. Boy, oh, boy. [He goes back into the Chum Bucket] SpongeBob: [Rides the dispenser up to 3 carolers] Hello, fellow revelers! Would you like a Christmas treat? Bill: Why, sure, SpongeBob! Fish 2: Yeah, who doesn't like treats? SpongeBob: [Dives into the dispenser and emerges with a plate of fruitcake] Nothing loosens up the old pipes like some fruitcake. Dig in! [They all take a piece] Fish 2: It's like a present for my mouth! SpongeBob: I knew you'd like it. Bill: [Grows bushy eyebrows, bags under his eyes, and five-o'clock shadow] Hey! Did we come here to sing or eat fancy cake? Fish 2: Whoa, calm down, Bill! What do you want to sing? Bill: Well, I want to sing the only Christmas song that matters, and that's \u201cJingle Bells\u201d. From the top! A one and a two and a \u2013 Fish 3: [Turns into a jerk] No, hold your holly! We're singing the best Christmas song ever, and that's \u201cSilver Bells\u201d! Bill: Wrong bells, buddy! Fish 2: [Turns into a jerk] Hey, I want to sing \u201cRandolph the Red-Nosed Seahorse\u201d! [They all continue to argue] SpongeBob: [Driving away, unaware that they have been poisoned with Jerktonium] Great to see people so passionate about the holidays. Plankton: [Emerges from the Chum Bucket on a unicycle] What's all the racket? What do you know? The Jerktonium seems to work on these jerks. Very interesting. [Cut to a shot of a Christmas parade in town] SpongeBob: Oh boy, a Christmas parade! The perfect occasion to spread some mouthwatering joy. [Singing] Oh, everyone, try some hot fruitcake today. Eat it all up and you will shout \u201cHooray!\u201d! Bikini Bottomites: Yay! SpongeBob: Everyone can get behind a mouthful of warm sunshine, everyone eat a Christmas time clich\u00e9. [People start turning into jerks. Somebody pops a kid's balloon. Another person smashes a gift over somebody's head. Pearl squirts water at passers by] Everyone can get behind a mouthful of Christmas time, let's all eat some hot fruitcake today! Plankton: [Cycling through the rioting town] This just keeps getting better and better. Costumed Santa: [On a float, with a boy on his knee] Ho ho ho! So, little boy, what would you like for Christmas? Boy: I want a sled and a truck and a bike and a train ... SpongeBob: Hi, Santa! Have some fruitcake. [He throws a piece] Boy: And a water pistol and a helicopter and \u2013 and, uh ... Costumed Santa: [Turns into a jerk] Well, why don't you get a job and buy all that junk yourself? And while you're at it try brushing your teeth, you little - SpongeBob: Have some fruitcake! [Hands a piece to the float driver] Driver: Thanks! [He turns into a jerk, which shocks him in surprise] That's it! I'm outta here! [He frantically\u00a0leaves the float and it crashes off the end of a cliff] Boy: [Bouncing on the Costumed Santa's belly] Whee-ee-ee! Oh, yeah. And I want a trampoline! Plankton: Success! Soon all the Bikini Bottomites will be jerks! Now I just need to figure out what to do about old SpongeBoy. [Cut to Plankton's lab] Karen: Once again your master plan is fatally flawed. [She brings up a diagram] It seems that SpongeBob's innocent love of the holidays shields his heart from the effects of Jerktonium. SpongeBob Diagram: Dahahaha! That tickles. Plankton: Drat! That square-head's gonna throw my whole naughty to nice curve right off! I guess it's time to introduce Plan B. [He pulls a lever and\u00a0a giant\u00a0SpongeBob robot\u00a0drops from the ceiling] Hahahahaha! Plan B, meet Karen. Now go, my automated agent of naughtiness, go and destroy SpongeBob's good name! [He laughs evilly but nothing happens] Huh? Oh yeah. [He winds up a key in\u00a0its back] ToyBob: I am ready, I am ready, I am ready. Ready to destroy Christmas. [Flames shoot from his nose. He leaves the Chum Bucket and destroys a car, then heads for the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs: What's goin' on out here? Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob. [ToyBob burns the Krusty Krab sign, which collapses on Mr. Krabs] Plankton: Oh, SpongeBob, you've been a bad, bad toy! [The mail truck is still spinning out of control and finally comes to rest. The bound and gagged mailman escapes and jumps away] Patchy: I can't believe we survived that horrifying car accident without a scratch. [He gets out of the truck and slips on the ice] Ow! [He notices the fork in the tire] Aw, here's the problem. Oh, that's not good. Flat tire, huh? Looks as sad as an empty bag of beef. Brrr! It's cold up here. Why don't you kids at home go make a nice hot cup of cocoa while Potty builds me a fire? [We see Potty and Patchy huddled around a fire.] Patchy: [Shivering] Hello, kiddies. It's so cold, me eye patch cracked. There hasn't been any food or water or food or food for over 20 minutes. [Coughs] Boy, I could sure go for some buffalo wings right about now. Sounds good. Eh, Potty? [Patchy looks at Potty and imagines him turning into\u00a0a plate of buffalo wings] With a side of blue cheese dressing. [He grabs a fork, licks his lips, and lunges at Potty who flies up. Patchy bites on the log Potty was sitting on] Potty: Squawk! What are you doing? Patchy: I'm sorry, Potty, I don't know what got into me. I'm just so hungry! Potty: It's okay, Patchy, I can't stay mad at you. Patchy: Aww. [Potty imagines Patchy's head turning into a\u00a0suet cake covered in bird food] Patchy: Why are you looking at me like that, bird? [Potty pecks at his head] What are you doing? [Cut to SpongeBob's storyline; SpongeBob is riding the dispenser through Bikini Bottom and comes across the three carolers he first gave Plankton's fruitcake to] SpongeBob: Merry Christmas, fellas! Bill: Ah, go stuff a stocking! SpongeBob: Gee. That wasn't very nice. [He drives past Mr. Krabs, who is mending the Krusty Krab sign] Seasons greetings, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs: Wha-... Well, you got some nerve, SpongeBob! This is comin' outta yer salary! SpongeBob: What's that all about? [He drives up to Patrick, who is setting another trap ] Hey, Patrick! What're you up to? Patrick: I think it's pretty obvious, SpongeBob! [He eats a slice of\u00a0fruitcake] I'm eating fruitcake and setting a tiger trap for Santa! Now, if you don't mind, I'm kind of busy right now. SpongeBob: Yeesh, okay. Don't have to be a jerk about it. Everybody's on edge today. Must be the holiday jitters. Patrick: NosyPants. [He falls into his own trap] Yay, it works! Oh. Hello, big, striped shrimp. [ He screams as it attacks him] [The next morning, SpongeBob steps outside] SpongeBob: Ah, Christmas Eve! When all of Bikini Bottom is filled with good will. Johnny: Merry Christmas, Frankie. Frankie: Merry Christmas to you, too, Johnny. [Throws a snowball in Johnny's face] SpongeBob: More like bad will! Gosh, if people don't start acting nicer, Santa's going to fly right past Bikini Bottom this Christmas Eve! I'm gonna need some help. [Snowflake transition; he knocks on Squidward's door] Squidward! Squidward: [From inside] I'm not home! SpongeBob: Oh gosh, what do I do now? Squidward: Why don't you go bother Sandy? SpongeBob: Good idea, Squidward. I'll have to thank you when you get home. [He leaves, and\u00a0ToyBob walks up to Squidward's house, knocking on the door by walking into it] Squidward: I said I'm not home! [ToyBob wrenches the door off its hinges] SpongeBob, give me back my door! [ToyBob smashes it over Squidward's head] [Snowflake transition to Sandy's treedome] SpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy! I need your help! It's Christmas Eve and everyone in Bikini Bottom are acting like jerks! You gotta help me find out why. Sandy: [Turns around and bares her teeth, scaring SpongeBob, showing that she's become a jerk] Why should I help all them jerks? SpongeBob: Because those jerks don't care about Christmas any more, Sandy! It's a problem. Sandy: Problem? My only problem is I'm out of fruitcake. Only thing I've got left to eat are boring old nuts. [She throws one at SpongeBob] SpongeBob: Oh, the problem isn't the fruitcake! The problem is that everyone, including you, is acting like a jerk! Oh, I'll have to solve this on my own. [He turns to leave and slips on a nut, accidentally throwing the fruitcake into Sandy's Christmas analyzer] Whoa! Sandy: Dagnabbit, SpongeBob, you got fruitcake in my Christmas magic analyzer! [An alarm sounds] Well, I'll be hornswaggled. My analyzer's found something in the fruitcake! [She looks at the reading and gasps] This is terrible! SpongeBob: What is it, Sandy? Sandy: The fruitcake is contaminated with Jerktonium! No wonder I've been as ornery as a sidewinder on a hot driveway. Jerktonium is the orneriest element of them all and your fruitcake is full of it. Where'd you get that fruitcake, anyway? SpongeBob: From Plankton, he baked it. Sandy: You took food from Plankton and fed it to everyone in town? SpongeBob: Uh-huh Sandy: You're an idiot. SpongeBob: Uh-huh Sandy: No wonder everyone in town is a big old meanie. SpongeBob: [Realizes] Oh! I've eaten tons of that fruitcake! I must be the biggest jerk in town! Sandy: [Pokes him] Hmm \u2026 You don't act jerky. For some reason, it's not affecting you. [She puts a scanner in front of him] It must be a combination of your tiny brain and pure heart. You're immune to Jerktonium, SpongeBob, but the rest of us will need an antidote. I'll set the analyzer to calculate the formula. [She pulls a switch and a music score pops out] Why, this formula for the antidote don't make no sense at all! SpongeBob: Hmm\u2026 That's no formula! It's a song! [He hums it, and Sandy becomes her normal self] Sandy, the song is the antidote! [Cut to downtown Bikini Bottom, where people are still rioting] Fish 6: Oh yeah? Well your fins are fat! SpongeBob: Ahoy, everybody! [He snaps his fingers and mistletoe appears over the heads of the two fish he fed Plankton's fruitcake to, curing them of Jerktonium poisoning. He snaps again and a pile of presents appears, curing two other fish.\u00a0A little boy begins to play Christmas baubles like bells] SpongeBob: \u266aBring joy to the world, it's the thing to do, but the world does not revolve around you. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas! [Throws a snowball at Mr. Krabs and cures him] Be nice to babies and animals, old folks, too. 'Cause that's how you'd like them to treat you! Use turn signals. Don't screen my calls. Don't you wreck the house when you deck the halls. Spit your gum where it won't wind up on my shoe. Squeeze toothpaste from the bottom of the tube. Don't be a jerk.\u00a0It's Christmas! It's Christmas! [Hands a gift to Pearl, who continues to pass it down a line,\u00a0curing people as they receive it, except for Squidward, who was unaffected by the Jerktonium] When others are talking, never interrupt. Don't put people down or leave the toilet seat up.\u00a0It's the time for families and holly and turkey. 'Tis the season to be jolly, not jerky!\u266a SpongeBob's Friends and Co.: [in background chorus' voices] \u266aJolly, not jerky!\u266a SpongeBob: \u266aSanta brought nearly every gift on your list. Why whine about the one that he missed? Don't be a jerk, it's Christmas! It's Christmas! Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas!\u266a Sandy: Congratulations, SpongeBob, your song worked! SpongeBob: And not a moment too soon. Santa should be here any minute. Mr. Krabs: You ain't kiddin'. Here he comes now! [They all clear the way as Santa Claus' sleigh and reindeer land in front of the Krusty Krab] SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Santa! You made it! Santa: Whoa, ho, ho, ho, ho! Cool your jets there, son. I'm afraid I'm the bearer of bad tidings. SpongeBob: Oh, no! Santa: Oh, yes . It seems you're all on my naughty list this year. SpongeBob: Naughty list?! Santa: No\u00a0buts about it. You've all been a bunch of jerks . SpongeBob: But---! Santa: But nothing .\u00a0Coal for everyone! Except Plankton . SpongeBob, Friends and Co.: Wha-a-at! Santa: I'm just as surprised as you , but compared to the rest of you, he's been a saint . [Hands him the Krabby Patty formula] Here you go, Sheldon, I believe this is what you asked for. Mr. Krabs: Me secret formuler? How did you get that? Santa: I have my ways. [ An elf reaches into Mr. Krabs' pocket and takes his wallet] Pearl: Um... Dad? Mr. Krabs: Huh? [Slaps the elf] Get out of me pocket, ya foul goblin! SpongeBob: But- but- but- but- but- but---! [Patrick slaps him] But, Santa, you've got it all wrong ! Santa: On the contrary, SpongeBob, you're the worst of all. There you go, right now\u2014wreaking havoc ! [The crowd parts and reveals the rampaging ToyBob] Plankton: [Realizing he made huge mistake] Uh-oh. ToyBob: [Searches the citizens around and spots Santa] I am ready to destroy Christmas. [transforms into his mega mode] Destroy Santa. SpongeBob: If you want Santa, you gotta get through me! Mega ToyBob: Okey-dokey. [Karate chops SpongeBob] Santa: Oh, my. SpongeBob: Is that all you got? [Mega ToyBob picks him up and flings him far away and releases a flame] Santa: I'm outta here. [He hides in the Krusty Krab, but\u00a0ToyBob\u00a0finds him and picks him up] You do realize this counts as, naughty . SpongeBob: You put that jolly elf down, you big tin imposter! [Fires fruitcake at Mega ToyBob] Hot from the oven, full of lovin'! [Rushes back to rescue Santa] Hurry up, Santa, hop on! [Mega ToyBob shorts out and explodes] Santa: Thanks again for saving my keister. SpongeBob: Oh, it was nothing. Santa: You're clearly a very good lad, unlike the owner of that wind-up monstrosity . [An elf hands him the wind-up key] What have\u00a0we got there? \"If found, please return to the Chum Bucket\"? Plankton?! Plankton: [Knowing he is in big trouble] Uh-oh. Mr. Krabs: Hand it over,\u00a0Sheldon. Don't make it any worse. [Takes the Krabby Patty\u00a0formula. Plankton gets flung at Santa's sleigh, and he splatters all over it. He falls off, leaving squish marks on the sleigh] Santa: O.K., boys, let's give Plankton what he deserves . [The elves pour coal onto Plankton. Coal rock transition to later.] So long, kiddies! Ho-o-o-o, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! [He flies away as everyone [except Squidward] waves goodbye to him] SpongeBob: Hey, has anyone seen Patrick? Patrick: [Hiding on Santa's sleigh] Hee hee hee hee. I gotcha! [Catches Santa in a net, sending the sleigh off course] [Potty is still pecking Patchy's head] Patchy: [Notices a sign] Santa's workshop? I'm here, Santa! I'm here! Potty: I'm not going in there. Patchy: Santa! [He sits\u00a0on Santa's lap\u00a0and pulls out\u00a0his letter] There's only one thing I wants for Christmas! And it's to meet me hero, SpongeBob SquarePants. [Santa\u00a0sprinkles magic dust\u00a0on Patchy to make his wish come true, then the illusion breaks and Patchy realizes he's in a cave with a polar\u00a0bear who sprinkled him with salt because he wants to eat him. The bear chases him. The scene then cuts to Potty standing next to Santa] Santa: I think stealing a mail truck definitely counts as naughty. Wouldn't you say, Potty? Potty: I sure would, Santa. [They laugh] Both: Merry Christmas."

  "synopsis": [
   "In the beginning of the episode, Sandy is with her scout troop as they do one final check before they head off to the moon. SpongeBob says he has brought a pack of Fizz Bomb Cola with him and is waiting for a Krabby Patty. Pearl says she brought her pom-poms with her and Squidina says she brought action figures. The group then starts to head to the moon but SpongeBob states he is still waiting for his Krabby Patty order, so an impatient Sandy has to drag him inside her tree. At that time, Squidward comes with SpongeBob's Krabby Patty but sees that SpongeBob is not here, so he drops it off. Suddenly, the rocket takes off with Squidward inside.In space, the gang goes up against an asteroid belt, a cold belt, hot belt, and a radiation belt, with the radiation belt mutating SpongeBob's arm and Squidward himself. Then they make it to the moon, where Sandy assigns jobs to SpongeBob, Pearl, and Squidina. While the gang is doing these tasks, Squidward is looking through craters and seeing live action things. Meanwhile, Squidina and Pearl get in a fight and Squidina throws a rock at Pearl but misses, only to have the rock orbit the moon and hit Pearl in the helmet.Squidward gets out of the craters, and starts thinking that the Moon is a \"No SpongeBob zone.\" SpongeBob is looking for intelligent life, until he hears Squidward echoing \"I'm the man on the moon!\" He then finds the Krabby Patty delivery bag, and toots a horn, and Sandy comes immediately to tell SpongeBob that \"if they were really intelligent, they would've ate it. Speaking of eat, can you go get the lunch I packed in the rocket?\" So SpongeBob goes and tries to get the lunch button, moving the moon out of orbit. Sandy says that that would have disastrous effect on the Earth's tide. The Bikini Bottomites are forced to crawl on the ground to avoid suffocation. Then, strange laughing is happening outside, so the guys go to check it out.It turns out that Santa was sleeping on the dark side of the moon until Squidward accidentally woke him up. Santa then notices that the Earth is further away from the moon. He soon realizes it was because of SpongeBob, due to his history of mayhem. Then the gang try to move the moon back into orbit by burping it back with Fizz Bomb Cola, but when that doesn't work they try to sail it back into orbit, but then that won't work because there is no wind on the moon. So they try to push it back. Soon after, Squidward, Sandy, Squidina, and Pearl get in the rocket and Santa and SpongeBob are using a jack-in-the-box to move the anchor off the moon, but SpongeBob accidentally destroys the moon, with jack. The tide on Earth is now even lower. Then Santa uses a squirt gun and pumps SpongeBob full of water. After that Sandy and the guys get back to Earth, the tide back to normal.Sandy's group returned to Earth, with Pearl and Squidina now on friendly terms. Sandy offers Squidward a part in the club, though he refuses since the adventure was enough for him. Sandy then wonders about SpongeBob, who is acting as the replacement moon, teasing people in a big city. SpongeBob reveals that Santa is bringing them a new moon in December, and the citizens below complain on this news. SpongeBob realizes his error of spoiling the surprise, while Santa passes by and calls him a menace again. SpongeBob then laughs at this while wishing a happy holiday, closing the episode."

   "[The episode begins at Sandy's treedome at night. Sandy is leading her Science Scouts on a very important mission.] Sandy: All right, Science Scouts. One last check on supplies. We all need to be prepared for a campout on the moon. [points to SpongeBob] SpongeBob. SpongeBob: [digs into his backpack and pulls out a pack of Fizz Bomb Cola] Six-pack of Fizz Bomb Cola. [pulls out a bubble wand] Bubble wand. [blows a bubble shaped like the Moon and pulls out a tank top] Mesh tank top. [purrs] And I'm waiting on a Krabby Patty delivery. Sandy: Well, that's not what I had in mind when I said supplies. How 'bout you, Pearl? Pearl: Oh. [digs in her bag and pulls out pom-poms] Pom-poms, [pulls out a megaphone and screams in SpongeBob's face] megaphone, and spirit! [jumps and shakes the treedome, knocking everyone over] Squidina Star: [Annoyed at Pearl] Ugh. Do you always have to rub it in my face that you're a cheerleader? Pearl: [rubs pom-poms on Squidina's face] Yes, I do ! [blows raspberry at Squidina, who glares at Pearl with her arms crossed] Sandy: Scouts, I don't think you cotton to what we're doin'. We're going to the moon! [Bubble Bass shows his butt outside the treedome.] SpongeBob, Pearl, & Squidina: Eww! Bubble Bass: Huh? [pulls up his pants] Mm! [scoffs and leaves] Sandy: No, that moon. [points to the moon in the sky] SpongeBob, Pearl, & Squidina: Ohh! Sandy: Squidina, what did you bring? Squidina: [digs in her bag and pulls out a pair of glasses] Eyeglasses, [pulls out comic books] comic books, [pulls out action figures] and action figures. Pearl: [Now annoyed at Squidina] Ugh! Can a person be any nerdier? SpongeBob: I can. [holds up an ugly picture of himself] Pearl: Ew! Sandy: Remember, Scouts, we're scientists. Let's behave like it. [SpongeBob washes his tank top, hangs it on the clothesline and blows bubbles through the holes.] SpongeBob: Science! Sandy: [grumbles and opens the door] Everybody on board for lift-off? [Squidina and Pearl enter the tree. Pearl's enormous head gets stuck in the door and Sandy pushes her in.] Pearl: Ouch! Sandy: Let's go, Scout! SpongeBob: But I'm still waiting for the Krabby Patty delivery guy. [Sandy takes out her telescope and looks through it. The moon moves directly to the right spot where the X is.] Sandy: The moon is in perfect position for us to launch. [puts her telescope away] We gotta leave now! [grabs SpongeBob and drags him in her tree] [Outside the treedome, someone is ringing the doorbell three times. It turns out to be Squidward, who was supposedly delivering a Krabby Patty to SpongeBob.] Squidward: Hello? Delivery. [grumbles and enters the treedome] Did someone order a Krabby Patty? [walks over to the picnic table and leaves the delivery there; he picks one of Sandy's records and looks at it] Huh? Uhh. Yuck. Hokey hoo-ha for hicks. [the treedome starts to shake and Squidward starts to panic] Ahh! I take it back! I could learn to like songs about tractors...maybe. [Sandy pushes some buttons on her control panel, which causes a shaking motion that scares her scouts.] Sandy: Uh, sorry about that. Just some backfire is all. SpongeBob: Safety first. [Squidina and Pearl fasten their seatbelts. SpongeBob attempts to fasten his, but his seatbelt rolls back. He attempts to tie the seatbelt in a knot, but it unravels and slaps him in the face.] SpongeBob: Ugh, why you! [pulls his seatbelt up, but gets all tangled up in it] Sandy: Uhh\u2026 everything okay back there, SpongeBob? [SpongeBob gives Sandy a thumbs up after getting tangled up by his seatbelt. The seatbelt untangles him and flips him in his helmet. Sandy pulls out a lasso and ties SpongeBob down.] SpongeBob: Thanks! Sandy: Three, two, one, launch! [pushes the lunch button and it flips over, revealing a sandwich, an apple, and a carton of milk] Whoops! Lunch. [pushes the launch button] [The treedome begins shaking and is about to launch into space. Squidward runs to the door and attempts to leave, but the vibration makes him fall over. The treedome, now redesigned as a rocket ship, blasts off from the ground and starts flying. Sandy, Squidina, Pearl, and SpongeBob's faces distort as the rocket launches upward. SpongeBob laughs and Squidward's face distorts as well. Squidward crawls over to the dome's glass and sees Bikini Bottom getting smaller below him. The rocket emerges from the ocean, exits the Earth's stratosphere, and directly heads into outer space. Squidward panics, screams, and runs around like crazy. But suddenly, he starts floating since there is no gravity in space.] Squidward: Eh, did I die? Am I a ghost? [screams as he floats around] Sandy: [turns off the rocket's engines] Okay, Scouts, you're free to move about the cabin. SpongeBob: [starts floating] Ooh, whoa! I'm flying, I'm flying! [his skirt falls down, revealing his underwear] Whoop! [covers his underwear and laughs] [SpongeBob's helmet falls off. Then SpongeBob's eyes, nose, and mouth fall off his body while he laughs.] Sandy: [checking the peanut plant's pulse] This peanut plant's pulse is staying steady in zero G. Pearl: [while dancing ballet] I've never been so light before. [spins around uncontrollably, flies directly into some wires and gets zapped by them; she sighs and chuckles] Sandy: Uhh, I gotta fix that. Squidina: [playing with her action figures] Teenage Action Girl, rise to the rescue of Action Dog while Teenage Action Boy floats in the corner and mopes. [imitating] I don't care. Oh, no! Help me! [Pearl floats past Squidina, almost knocking her over] Hey! Watch it, you big orca! Pearl: You watch it, you big dorka! [Squidina blows a raspberry. Bubble transition to later in Sandy's treedome, as the record begins playing country music. The tree's acorns. the running wheel, the Fixin' to Go Nuts record, and the picnic table are floating everywhere. Squidward is cowering in fear, completely unaware of the fact that he is in outer space.] Squidward: There can only be one explanation. I've lost my mind! [starting to lose sanity] All those years working at the Krusty Krab and I finally snapped! [hits his head against the glass and floats down] Ohh, going crazy is actually a relief. [sighs] All my stress is gone. [spins an acorn on his tentacle; suddenly, the rocket is getting hit by asteroids and space junk outside; Squidward screams in panic] All my stress is back! Sandy: Uh-oh, we've got space junk! [hops into her chair and begins pushing buttons on her control panel] Everybody, back in your seats. Trays in upright positions. Head between your knees. Your mama can't save you now! [SpongeBob, Squidina, and Pearl sit back into their seats and fasten their seatbelts. The rocket continues flying through the asteroid belt despite getting hit by space junk. A bowling ball crashes into the window and Sandy hits it back outside with a bat.] SpongeBob: [cheers with Squidina and Pearl] Home run! [whistles] [Sandy closes the damaged window with a pair of trousers. The rocket safely makes it out of the asteroid belt.] Sandy: We've still get a few Astro Belts to get through. Brace yourselves for the cold belt! [The rocket flies directly into the cold belt, which is a ring of snowmen, igloos, freezers, and icebergs. Squidward floats around while frozen in a block of ice. SpongeBob is building a snowman version of Patrick Star and laughs. Pearl and Squidina hover themselves and shiver. Sandy is wearing a warm coat and holding a mug of hot chocolate. She looks out through the telescope.] Sandy: Next up, we got a hot belt! [The rocket flies directly into the hot belt, which is a ring of flaming asteroids and stoves. SpongeBob's Patrick-snowman melts from the hot belt's heat.] SpongeBob: Heh-heh. Patty melt. [chuckles] [Sandy breathes heavily and fans herself with her tail; she goes to look through the telescope, but burns her hands] Sandy: Ouch! [blows her hands, looks through the telescope and sees the radiation belt up ahead] Huh! We're going through the radiation belt! That could cause mutations! Everyone, get under your lead blankets! Pearl: [gasps] Mutations?! I must protect my beautiful face! [puts a lead blanket over her] [SpongeBob pulls a lead blanket out from his bag and puts it over him. The rocket flies directly through the radiation belt. Sandy, Pearl, Squidina, and SpongeBob take cover under their lead blankets. SpongeBob sticks his hand out from under the blanket and his hand becomes mutated. SpongeBob laughs and his hand roars. His hand begins gnawing on his helmet.] SpongeBob: Aww. [chuckles] [Back in the treedome, Squidward begins to suffer from the effects of the radiation belt. The belt's effects mutates Squidward's body into different shapes.] Squidward: Oh, good Neptune! I'm going through puberty again! [his body keeps changing shapes and he shrinks into a baby version of himself] [The rocket makes it safely through the radiation belt and resumes flying to the moon.] Sandy: Okay, Scouts, it's all safe now. [Squidina, Pearl, and SpongeBob uncover themselves; pulls down her telescope] Let's see where we are. [looks through] Craters, craters\u2014 [a giant eyeball appears as a girl screams in the background] Oh! Giant eyeball? Now I'm as confused as a goat on Astroturf. [hears SpongeBob laughing outside] SpongeBob! SpongeBob: [appears outside and looking through the telescope] Hey, there's a tiny little squirrel in here. [Sandy is angrily wagging her tail] How'd you get in there, you little fuzz ball? Sandy: I love the guy, but if his brains were dynamite, he couldn't blow his nose. [The rocket lands and makes a successful touchdown on the moon's surface. The rocket deploys its anchor so it won't float away. Back in the treedome, Squidward pops out from under the picnic table.] Squidward: Huh? We've stopped. It's all over! I'm back home! [laughs as he runs to the front door; he exits the dome and begins walking, but he floats downward since there's no gravity; he then notices the planet Earth in front of him] Wait a minute. That's the Earth. And that down there is the moon? So, somehow the treedome flew here. [looks down] Good Neptune, I'm falling! Wait, if I remember my high school science, on the moon, I'm much lighter than on Earth. Which means...ha! This fall won't hurt me. [But unfortunately for Squidward, as he lands on the moon and despite the zero gravity, he ends up getting crushed and smooshed into his helmet. He starts waddling around on the Moon's surface until he trips and falls into one of the moon's craters. He gets up and pulls himself together from the fall's impact.] Squidward: [blubbers as he shakes his head] Oh, shrimp. Now where am I? Maybe this is the way out. [peaks through the tube and ends up in the desert; a vulture looks down and screeches at him; and pulls his head back from the tube; he runs over to another one] Maybe this one? [peaks through the second tube and ends up in the guitar of the cowboy squirrel] Country squirrel: Are y'all ready to go nuts for some hokey hoo-ha? [The crowd cheers. Squidward screams and pulls himself back from the tube.] Squidward: [walks over to another tube] Third time's a charm? [He peaks through the tube and ends up in his voice actor Rodger Bumpass's storyboard drawing. Squidward and Rodger scream at each other. Squidward pulls himself back from the tube and runs off.] [Bubble transition to back on the moon's surface. Sandy, Pearl, and Squidina exit the rocket and make their first steps on the moon.] Sandy: One small step for a squirrel... SpongeBob: Ooh! [goes to exit the rocket, but trips; he falls on top of Pearl and Squidina and they crash into Sandy's pile of camp supplies] One giant heap for SpongeKind. [laughs] [Sandy activates her camp supplies and all of the tents get set up for camp.] Sandy: All right, Science Scouts, everybody's got an assignment. Pearl, you measure the moon's gravity. Pearl: Rah, rah, sis, moon, bahhh! [floats upward] Sandy: Squidina, you collect moon rocks. Squidina: Way ahead of you, Ms. Scout Ma'am Cheeks! [throws a moon rock and starts looking for more] Pearl: [emerges from underneath a large moon boulder] Grrr-avity! [Squidina sighs and continues her search on more moon rocks.] Sandy: SpongeBob, you can search for intelligent life. SpongeBob: Aye, aye! Hmm...mmm... Sandy: You do know how to recognize intelligent life, right? SpongeBob: Oh, sure. [holds up a saw] I cut open their heads to see if they have any brains. Sandy: [sighs, takes the saw, and gives SpongeBob a horn] If you find anything, just toot. [SpongeBob takes the horn and floats away with it] Now to study the moon's gravitational effects on my nuts. [walks over to her gravitational experiments and begins her tests] [Squidina continues gathering moon rocks until Pearl rubs her pom-poms on her face.] Pearl: I'm number one! You're number two! I'm gonna beat the nerd out of you! Squidina: [huffs] No one beats the nerd out of Squidina! [throws a moon rock at Pearl] Pearl: Whoa! [ducks from the incoming moon rock] Missed me! [laughs and blows a raspberry] [Squidina's moon rock float around the moon and hits Pearl in the face.] Squidina: Science! Yay! [Meanwhile, Squidward runs out from the moon's crater and boards it shut. He pants from exhaustion, throws his hammer away, and looks at the Earth again.] Squidward: Well, maybe being on the moon isn't so bad. After all, [takes out a tape measure and extends it] SpongeBob is over 238,000 miles away. [pauses and lets go of the tape measure] Random citizen: [gets hit by the tape measure] Ow! Squidward: [gasps] This moon is a no SpongeBob zone! [places a flag with a \"No SpongeBob\" sign on the moon's surface] Here, I'm the man on the moon! [his outburst creates a really loud echo; it was so loud that SpongeBob even heard it] SpongeBob: [pulls out a plastic ear and sticks it on his helmet] Um, did someone say, \"Man on the Moon?\" [looks in the crater] Hello? [stands on a stalagmite] Intelligent life? [peaks out from the crater] How about average smarts? [his bottom sticks out from another crater] I'd settle for common sense! [sighs until he sees Squidward's footprints on the moon's surface] Ooh! Intelligent footprints. [follows the footprints and climbs over the cliff, where he sees the Krabby Patty delivery Squidward was supposed to deliver; he walks over to the bag and honks the horn] Huh? [honks the horn once more] Wha-hoo! [marches around while honking the horn] I found it! I found it! Sandy: [pants as she arrived] What'd you find, SpaceBob? SpongeBob: Intelligent life. [honks the horn and points to the bag] Sandy: [digs into the bag] I'm not so sure about that. [pulls out a Krabby Patty] If they were intelligent, they would have eaten this Krabby Patty. SpongeBob: Ooh! Mmm, speaking of eating... [his stomach rumbles] Sandy: You're right! It's lunch time. [puts the Krabby Patty back in the bag] Would you mind fetching the lunch I prepared? SpongeBob: You bet! Just call me LunchBob. [SpongeBob begins running in place while floating. Sandy pushes SpongeBob down to help him walk on the moon's surface.] Sandy: Just press the button labeled \"lunch!\" [Meanwhile, Squidward is skipping around on the moon's surface like an stupid idiot. He believes that SpongeBob doesn't exist on the moon and is completely unaware that he's already on it.] Squidward: No SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no Sp\u2014 [stops at the dark side of the moon] Whoa! The dark side of the moon. [whimpers and peaks into it] SpongeBob? Are you in here? [pulls his head back out] No SpongeBob. [blubbers as he shakes his head] I have a strange feeling suddenly coming over me. Could it be...that I'm...happy? [stupidly walks into the dark side of the moon] [Bubble transition to SpongeBob inside Sandy's rocket trying to figure out which button is the lunch button.] SpongeBob: Lunch, lunch, where's lunch? Oh, there it is. [accidentally pushes the launch button and activates the rocket's engines] Computer: Preparing to launch. SpongeBob: No! [frantically pushes the launch button to stop] No, not launch! Lunch! [grabs a screwdriver and tries to pry the button off] [The rocket reactivates itself and starts to fly away. The anchor hooks itself on the moon's crater and begins pulling the moon into a different direction.] Pearl: Uh, wait, wait\u2014what's going on? [falls over] Squidina: [whimpers] How should I know? [falls over] Sandy: You guys wait here! [climbs up the anchor's chain, enters the rocket and stops the engine] Phew! SpongeBob? [sees SpongeBob outside the rocket] SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Oh, uh, Sandy! [chuckles] Hey, girl. I was just gonna run back home. I forgot, uh...my reading glasses. [sighs and pants while running in space] [Sandy activates a lasso, grabs SpongeBob and drags him back into the rocket.] Sandy: It's okay, SpongeBob. It's my fault for putting the launch and lunch button so close together. [looks at the monitor] Oh, no! The moon's been pulled out of its regular orbit. That could have disastrous effects on the Earth's tides. [Back on Earth and without the moon in its regular orbit, the ocean's tides are lowered. Bikini Atoll has no water and the ocean level in Bikini Bottom is decreasing.] Nat Peterson: Water's a little dry today. [The Bikini Bottomites are doing all that they can to stay alive as long as they can from decreased ocean level.] Sandy: And that last launch depleted our fuel. Santa: [off-screen] Ho-ho-ho. Sandy: That's weird. [Back on the moon, Pearl and Squidina hover together.] Squidina: [pants] I'm so sorry you're a cheerleader! Pearl: I'm sorry you're a nerd! Pearl & Squidina: That came out wrong! [cries] [SpongeBob and Sandy arrive back to Pearl and Squidina.] SpongeBob: Ooh, moon hugs! Make room for me. [hugs Pearl and Squidina] Come on, Sandy, bring it on in. [pulls Sandy in] Sandy: It's all right, Scouts. We just gotta figure out a way to get back to Earth. Pearl: But Sandy, we heard strange laughing coming from... [points to the dark side of the moon] in there. Santa: [off-screen] Ho-ho-ho. [Squidward appears from the dark side of the moon while being held by a mysterious being.] Pearl, Squidina, Sandy, & SpongeBob: Huh? [gasps] SpongeBob: Squidward? You're the man on the moon? Squidward: SpongeBob?! [sighs in defeat] Of course. Why not? [The mysterious being comes out from the dark side of the moon. The being turns out to be none other than the jolly old elf himself: Santa Claus. Santa drops Squidward down.] Squidward: Ohh! [falls on the moon's surface and gets crushed and smooshed in his helmet again] Oh! Oh! Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Santa: [notices SpongeBob] SpongeBob? Ho-ho! I should've known you'd have something to do with this. SpongeBob: Santy Claus! Well, Santa, you know the saying, where SpongeBob goes... Santa: I know, trouble follows. SpongeBob: I was gonna say laughter follows. [laughs] Sandy: Mr. Claus, what are you doing on the dark side? Santa: The dark side of the moon is the only place dark enough for me to get any sleep. [holds up a book and shows a picture of himself sleeping in his sleigh] I was sleeping like a baby\u2014visions of sugar plums. [turns the page and shows picture of Squidward stumbling in Santa's sleigh] Then this bad boy goes and bangs into my sleigh and wakes me up! Squidward: Well, I guess I'm getting nothing for Christmas...again. Santa: [notices the Earth is far away] Holy night, SpongeBob! Did you shrink the Earth? SpongeBob: [stammers nervously] Good question, Mr. Claus. Sandy: We're actually further from the Earth now. We could have moved the moon back into its regular orbit if we hadn't run out of fuel. [looks angrily at SpongeBob as he whistles nervously] Squidina: A controlled explosion might move the moon back. Pearl: [blows her bubble gum and pops] Ha, you're so smart. How do we do that? [SpongeBob strains himself as he thinks. He comes up with a really good idea and forms into a lightbulb. He takes out his pack of Fizz Bomb Cola.] SpongeBob: Ooh! Fizz Bomb Cola! A burp explosion in every can. [prolonged belching sound is heard] [Sandy, Pearl, and Squidina grab a can of Fizz Bomb Cola. SpongeBob opens his can.] Sandy: Yee-haw! That's my Science Scouts! [SpongeBob, Pearl, Squidina, and Sandy open a hole in their helmets and start drinking their soda. The soda's chemicals build up in their stomachs. They all take off their helmets and make the loudest belch in order to move the moon back into place. But nothing happens, since the moon is too heavy to move from such force.] Sandy: No go, the moon's too heavy. [belches and cover her mouth] Santa: [laughs] I think some children might be needing some brains for Christmas. [chuckles] [Pearl, Squidina, and SpongeBob came up with a different idea. They form a sail using their clothes in hopes of blowing the moon back into its orbit, leaving themselves in their underpants. They hoist the sail up with the mast.] Squidina: Perfection! SpongeBob: Now we just wait for a gust of wind. [They wait for a gust of wind. But since there is no air in space, nothing happens.] Sandy: Uh, interesting science fact: there's no atmosphere on the moon, therefore there's no wind. [Santa laughs really hard which causes his belt buckle to fall off.] SpongeBob: [dodges Santa's belt buckle] Why don't we just push the moon back? [Sandy, Squidina, Pearl, and Santa look strangely at SpongeBob. SpongeBob warms up and attempts to push the moon back with all his might. Squidina and Pearl attempt to do the same, but the moon is too heavy for them to move.] Santa: [laughs] You all should be a sea monster because you're Kraken me up! [rimshot] Get it? Kraken? [laughs] Sandy: [hops on his sleigh and grabs his beard] Santa Claus, you can do more than just say, \"Ho-ho-ho!\" at us! You can dig into that toy sack of yours and find something to help! Santa: But I'm having such a jolly, holly time! [Sandy grumbles angrily at Santa] You're right. I'm being naughty, not nice. [Bubble transition back to Sandy's rocket. Sandy, Squidward, Squidina, and Pearl fasten their seatbelts. Santa peaks in the rocket through the window.] Santa: Everyone nestled all snug? Sandy: We're all snug, Santa. But why is SpongeBob with you? SpongeBob: [sitting in Santa's sleigh] Yeah, why am I riding with you? Not that it isn't a pleasure. Santa: I want you close to me so I can keep an eye on you. You're a menace! [flies his sleigh above Sandy's rocket; SpongeBob falls on Santa's face, but Santa pulls him off] First, I'll push Sandy's rocket ship out of harm's way. SpongeBob, hand me that jack-in-the-box. SpongeBob: [digs in Santa's sack and pulls out a jack-in-the-box] Jack-in-the-box. [Santa winds up the jack-in-the-box and launches it at Sandy's rocket. The toy pushes the rocket off the moon's surface.] SpongeBob: Oh, oh! Let me try! [begins winding the jack-in-the-box] Santa: Be careful! Don't overwind it! SpongeBob: But it's gotta be strong enough to move the moon. [carelessly overwinds the jack-in-the-box really tight; the jack-in-the-box stops winding and breaks] Santa: You broke it, and it was my last one. SpongeBob: Hmm. [the handle begins turning slowly] Oh, wait. I think I can hear the last note struggling to get out. Come on, Jack, you can do it. I believe in you! [The jack-in-the-box launches out from the box in a fast pace.] Santa: Ho-ho-ho-ho! [The jack-in-the-box hits the moon. But instead of moving it back as it was supposed to, it ends up destroying the moon completely. Various moon rocks float in all directions. SpongeBob and Santa stare in shock.] SpongeBob: What happened? [Santa grumbles angrily at SpongeBob] Oh. Okay, sorry. It was my bad. [Moon rocks and debris fly around Sandy's rocket. Sandy, Pearl, Squidina, and Squidward look in shock now that the moon is destroyed. Back on Earth and with the moon gone, the ocean level has decreased even more and there is nothing but standing water. Bikini Bottomites are now crawling on their legs and arms.] Frankie Billy: [runs into Martha Smith] Oh, excuse me. Sorry. [chuckles] [Frankie Billy gets up and dries up from the heat so Martha can walk by. Back in space, Santa is overwhelmed at what SpongeBob did to the moon.] Santa: Oh-oh-oh. SpongeBob: Oh-oh-oh? Santa: Ho-ho-ho backwards. [sulks on his sleigh] [SpongeBob thinks and comes up with an idea to stop the problem once and for all.] SpongeBob: [leans closer to Santa's ear] Santa, do you have any water shooters in your bag? Santa: Yes, the whole sack is full of 'em. [SpongeBob digs in Santa's sack and finds a pile of water shooters. SpongeBob grabs a water shooter and gives it to Santa.] SpongeBob: All right, Santa, squirt me. Santa: [takes the water shooter] Oh, I get it. [SpongeBob takes off his helmet and Santa sprays SpongeBob with water to make him bigger.] SpongeBob: Whoo! Keep 'em coming, Santa! [Santa grabs another water shooter and sprays SpongeBob with water to make him even more bigger. Bubble transition to back on Earth, where the Bikini Bottomites are flopping around due to the decreased water level. But then, something miraculous happened. The water level rises up and the oceans are back to normal. Sandy's rocket flies back down to Earth and Sandy's treedome flies back into its rightful place on the ground. Sandy, Squidina, and Squidward exit the tree.] Sandy: Using the leftover Fizz Bomb Cola made an excellent rocket fuel, Science Scout Squidina. Squidina: Yep, the rocket burped us back. [laughs] Pearl: [pulls herself out of Sandy's tree] Wow! Would you mind teaching me some nerdy science stuff? Squidina: Sure, if you'll teach me some airhead cheerleader stuff. [Pearl and Squidina, who have now put aside their differences, skip happily out of Sandy's treedome, nearly knocking over Sandy and Squidward.] Sandy: Why don't you join the Science Scouts, Squidward? Squidward: No, thanks! Science is crazy and filled with lunatics! [leaves in disgust] Sandy: Speaking of luna, I wonder how old SpongeBob is doing. [The scene changes to New York City at night. SpongeBob, now as a temporary moon until Santa creates a brand new one, rises in the night sky and look down at the city.] SpongeBob: Good night, Earth! Hey, I'm mooning you. [laughs] Hello, lady. You sure look lovely by moonlight. Lady: Aww! SpongeBob: Hey, mister! I can see your bald spot. Man #1: Hey! SpongeBob: [laughs] Don't be alarmed, people. I'm only here 'til December, when Santa brings everybody a new moon for Christmas. [The citizens on the ground are honking their horns and groan in confusion as they start complaining.] Man #2: Come on! SpongeBob: Oh, sorry. Just gave away the big surprise, didn't I? Oh, well. Merry early Christmas! Santa: [flies past SpongeBob with his sleigh] Ho-ho-ho! You're a menace! [SpongeBob giggles and winks at the audience, as the episode irises out.]"

  "synopsis": [
   "In the beginning of the episode, Karen and Plankton are counting down to when the chum goes bad. Then, Plankton drives a huge barrel of old chum to the place where he usually dumps it, but when Plankton opens it, he realizes that it is already filled to the top, so he begins to look for other places. He tries the well, but it is also clogged.Along the way, Plankton accidentally stumbles upon SpongeBob, who is walking with Gary. SpongeBob spots a barrel of chum and asks what it is for. Plankton replies that it is for a holiday called Chum Day. On this day, the fish supposedly give each other chum. Then SpongeBob agrees to help Plankton make \"gifts\" in the city, much to his delight. The two of them go to Mr. Krabs' house, where they pour chum under the carpet. Then they start to spread chum everywhere until they finally say goodbye.On the way home, SpongeBob sees that the streets of Bikini Bottom are flooded with chum. The angry residents quickly run to Plankton and want to beat him, but SpongeBob, in a Santa hat, starts to tell and sing about the day of chum. Then the fish are happy and proceed to celebrate, but the sanitary inspector gives Plankton a fine and forces him to eat all the spilled chum for the safety of the citizens, as the episode ends."

   "[The episode begins at the Chum Bucket in the evening.] Karen and Plankton: Five, four, three, two, one! [The chum in the barrel turns brown and explodes all over the laboratory.] Plankton: [wipes rotten chum off his face] You know, it's remarkable how chum goes bad every week right on time. Karen: Yeah, just like your underpants. Plankton: What? They're good for another month. [his underwear pops off his body] Karen: Now go and get rid of that chum before the Health Inspector gives us a fine. [begins to leave, but turns around.] And don't play with it! Plankton: [pokes the rotten chum with a stick and laughs] But it makes a funny sound! [The rotten chum bubbles over and eats the stick. It belches out a foul breath in Plankton's face, making him faint. Plankton takes the barrel of rotten chum out of the Chum Bucket and goes to dump it down the sewer.] Plankton: Hm. [reads the sign] \"No chum dumping. $1 billion fine.\" Eat chum, sign! [sprays rotten chum at the sign; the rotten chum changes the sign that reads, \"Chum Dumping?....Alright fine! (See if I care!)] Ha-ha! [chuckles; tries to open the manhole, but it's stuck] Eugene H. Krabs! [lifts the manhole lid and overfills the sewer with rotten chum] I guess I've used this sewer hole one too many times. [tries to push the manhole lid, but it's too heavy; he paints the chum to make it look like the manhole lid] Those evil painting lessons I took really come in handy. [leaves with the barrel of rotten chum] Business Man: And so I said to Andy that, uh\u2014 [sinks into Plankton's rotten chum] Yeah, Larry. I'm gonna have to call you back. Plankton: [takes the barrel of chum to a wishing well] Oh, yeah, this old wishing well. I'll just dump some chum in here. [climbs up the well's wall and looks inside; he sees the well is full of rotten chum] Guess I've gone to this well once too often. [gasps] Wait, I know! [takes out a quarter] I wish this well was empty of chum. [tosses the quarter in the well, but sinks into the chum] Lousy rip off. [leaves with the barrel of rotten chum] [Little did Plankton know, the wishing well magically makes the chum disappear and the business man climbs out.] Business Man: [coughs out the quarter and calls on his phone] And I'm back. [Plankton takes the rotten chum to a local snail park. He pushes the hose through the hole in the fence and into one of the holes in SpongeBob's back. Rotten chum sprays out through SpongeBob's holes and he flies all around in the air. SpongeBob finds this very ticklish and laughs in joy. Down on the ground, Gary and the other citizens in the snail park are getting covered in rotten chum. SpongeBob lands on the ground with rotten chum all over his body.] SpongeBob: That was unbelievable! [sees the rotten chum] Wait a minute. What is this? Chum? Plankton: No, of course not. It's...it's, uh, a gift! SpongeBob: A gift? For who? Plankton: [walks off with the barrel of rotten chum] For you. For everyone. SpongeBob: Sure looks like chum. [follows SpongeBob] [Gary comes out from behind the fence.] Plankton: It's new chum. It's delicious. [eats some rotten chum and gags] SpongeBob: New chum? Ooh, let me try. Plankton: [slaps the rotten chum off of SpongeBob's fingers] No! Uh, you have to wait. For, uh, like a holiday. SpongeBob: Holiday? What holiday? Plankton: Um. Chum Day...? SpongeBob: Chum Day. Tell me about Chum Day. What's it like? What do you do? Plankton: I'll tell you all about it if you help me hide all these gifts. SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Chum Day. A brand new holiday! [turns to Gary] Okay, Gary. You can go home. Gary: Meow. [slithers off, gets into a boatmobile, and drives away off-screen] Plankton: Was that his car? SpongeBob: No. [Bubble transition to SpongeBob carrying Plankton and dragging the barrel of rotten chum down the street.] SpongeBob: Ooh, and does it snow chum on Chum Day? [giggles] Plankton: Uh, sure. SpongeBob: Do the kids make chum men? What about icicles? Do you call them [giggles] Chum-cicles? Plankton: Yeah, whatever. [sees Mr. Krabs' house] Wait a minute. This is Krabs' house. SpongeBob: Uh-huh. I thought we could hide his chum gifts inside by pumping them through the window. [goes up to the window] Oh, darn, the window's closed. Plankton: Hey, what's that? [blasts the window while distracting SpongeBob] The window's open. SpongeBob: Yay! [pushes the hose through the window and sprays rotten chum under the rug] Mr. Krabs: [yawns] Who's there? Wha\u2014 [trips over the lump in the rug and groans; he then falls asleep] SpongeBob: Aw. [pushes the rotten chum from under the rug to make it more comfortable] Shh. [takes the hose and exits Mr. Krabs' house through the window] I bet he has visions of sugar chums dancing in his head. [giggles] Plankton: Let's keep moving. [A montage of SpongeBob and Plankton hiding rotten chum in various places is shown. Bubble transition to SpongeBob hides some rotten chum in Patrick's rock. Then he hides it under the hat of a sleeping cowboy. Then he hides rotten chum in the chimney of a house. Then he hides rotten chum inside a child's teddy bear. Mrs. Puff is on her chair watching television and eating popcorn in the middle of the night. SpongeBob plugs her mouth with the hose and inflates her with rotten chum. Bubble transition to the Chum Bucket at the brink of dawn.] SpongeBob: And we'll drink chum-nog and sing around the chum-chum tree and there'll be colorful chum lights all over town. Plankton: Yes. That'd be good. Heh heh. [jumps off of SpongeBob and taps on the barrel] Sounds like there's only one scoop left. SpongeBob: Ooh, that one's for you! Let me hide it. I want to hide it! [Plankton groans and gives SpongeBob the last scoop of the rotten chum.] SpongeBob: Okay now, go home so you don't see where I hide it. Plankton: Oh, no, I wouldn't want to see that. [quietly as he takes the barrel back to the Chum Bucket] What a numbskull. [walks a few miles away from SpongeBob, then stops and looks back] SpongeBob: [sing-songy] No peeking! Plankton: [turns and resumes heading back to the Chum Bucket] Well, Plankton, you got rid of it all. And with no chum-uppance. [chuckles] Whoa. [pauses and looks around before resuming with his evil laughter] [Bubble transition to a very tired SpongeBob trying to find a place for the rotten chum.] SpongeBob: [yawns] What time is it? I guess I should hide Plankton's Chum Day gift before Chum Day's all over. [stops at a manhole] Ah-ha! I bet Plankton would never think to look in the sewer. [kicks the lid open and sees it filled with rotten chum] Oh. Chum. Oh, well. Maybe I can get a little more in there. [puts the chum in but doesn't go down; he pushes real hard to get it to go down then he closes the lid; he chuckles until suddenly, the ground shakes] [Rotten chum erupts from the ground and comes back down as little chum flakes. One man comes out from his house and slips on the rotten chum.] Man #1: [takes out a sign] Caution wet chum! [A lady is driving in her boatmobile, but skids off the road due to the rotten chum.] Lady #1: [crashes into sign and reads it] \"Slippery wet chum?\" Baby: Mmm, nummy! Baby's mother: [slaps the rotten chum off of her baby's hands] Don't eat chum off the sidewalk. Bah! Various Bikini Bottomites: There's chum here! Ew! [chattering angrily] What's with all the chum? Call my lawyer! Plankton: [comes out of the Chum Bucket and sees rotten chum snowing down] What has that yellow idiot done?! [becomes surrounded by an angry mob] Man #1: Our homes have been ruined by you and your stinking chum! Woman: Your chum ruined my hair! Patrick: Your chum made me dumb! Man #2: You were already dumb. Patrick: Well, it didn't make me any smarter! Kid #1: Get him! Angry mob: Yeah! [grab Plankton and prepare to beat him up] [Suddenly, SpongeBob, who is wearing a Santa hat, appears and is ice skating on the rotten chum.] Choir: [sings in the tune of Carol of the Bells off-screen] \u266aChum, chum, chum, chum, chum-chum-chum-chum\u266a [SpongeBob skids some of the rotten chum on Patrick and the angry mob.] SpongeBob: We shouldn't be fighting. [picks up two scoops of rotten chum] It's Chum Day. Man #1: Chum Day? Baby's mother: What's Chum Day? SpongeBob: [skates all over the place while singing in the tune of Deck the Halls] \u266a Deck the sea with lumps of new chum / Chuma chuma chum, chum, chum, chum, chum / 'Tis the season to be chum dumb / Chuma chuma chum, chum, chum, chum, chum / Don we now our chum apparel / Chuma chum chuma chum, chum, chum, chum / As we sing this stinky carol / Chuma chuma chum, chum, chum, chum, chum \u266a [Everyone looks at SpongeBob with blank and confused looks on their faces.] SpongeBob: [takes some chum and makes it into a beard, making himself a chum version of Santa Claus] Chum! Chum! Chum! Hello, I'm Chumta Claus. [Everyone is still looking at SpongeBob with blank and confused looks on their faces.] Man #1: So anyway, back to the mob violence. [Just as everyone proceed to beating Plankton to the bone, they stop and notice all the children having fun. Building chum men, making chum angels and throwing chum balls like how they do it when it snows in the winter. A kid on a sled slides up to the angry mob.] Kid #2: Merry Chum Day, everyone. Angry mob: [confused] Huh? [subside their anger and instead greets each other with thanks like how they do it on Christmas] Strong grip, huh? Yeah. Mayor: I officially declare today Chum Day! [kicks the kid on the sled away by accident] [Everyone cheers in excitement. Bubble transition to kids decorating a tree with rotten chum like how they decorate a Christmas tree. The purple kid wakes up and a lump of rotten chum comes out of his teddy bear.] Kid #3: Whoa! Yay! Man #3: [trying to catch chum flakes on his tongue like how everyone does it with snowflakes] Whoo! Heh. Tastes really bad. Nancy Suzy Fish: But the holiday spirit is keeping us in denial. Man #3: [holds up a lump of rotten chum with a toe in it] Gristle toe? [shares a kiss with Nancy Suzy Fish] [Squidward wakes up from his bed and goes to the window. He gasps in wonder and sees chum flakes falling.] Squidward: Huh? [sees Morty walking in the sidewalk] Ah. You! Boy! What day is today? Morty: Today? Squidward: Such an intelligent boy. A remarkable boy. Yes, today! What is today? Morty: Why, it's Chum Day! Squidward: Then I haven't missed it! [pauses] Wait a minute. Chum Day?! That's disgusting! [slams his window shut] [Everyone is continuing their Chum Day festivities.] Plankton: You all love Chum Day? [mutters in excitement] It was me! I invented Chum Day! Chum Day is copy-written by me! [gets bumped into the Health Inspector's shoes] Andy Yellowtail: Uh, excuse me, are you responsible for all this chum? Plankton: Yes, that's right. You're welcome. Andy Yellowtail: Well, as the Health Inspector, [holds up his badge] I've got something for you. [gives Plankton a paper] Plankton: Hm. [reads paper] $1 billion?! [whimpers and faints] Andy Yellowtail: You know, there is a way out of paying the fine. Plankton: I'll do it. What is it? Andy Yellowtail: [holds up a spoon] You can eat up all the chum. [scoops up some rotten chum and feeds it to Plankton] Plankton: [coughs] Isn't there anyone that knows the true meaning of Chum Day? SpongeBob: I know. Plankton: Huh? SpongeBob: Lights, please. [the lights turn off and a spotlight shines on SpongeBob] And lo, there was chum. A food that turned from revolting to festive by magical thinking. And the goodwill of chum clogged the hearts of fish kind and ushered in a new\u2014 [gets hit numerous times by chum balls, much to his joyful laughter] French narrator: Several days later... [The scene changes to Bikini Bottom all clean and sparkly again. Plankton, who has become fat from eating all of the rotten chum, scoops up the last remaining of the chum and eats it, much to his discomfort, ending the episode.]"

  "synopsis": [
   "In the middle of the night, SpongeBob is having a nightmare while chattering his teeth. After SpongeBob wakes up from the nightmare, he hears a noise down in his kitchen. SpongeBob is frightened about the noise. He tries to call for help, and realizes that his telephone line is cut, and later puts on his army helmet and grabs his tennis racket. His knees are shaking as he runs to open up the door, and slides down to the library. SpongeBob later trips on his toy truck, and falls down the steps. He runs into his kitchen and finds his novelty teeth chattering. He finds his fancy boot hopping around and smacks the boot with his tennis racket which leads him to smack his face. SpongeBob drops his tennis racket and karate-chops the boot, unaware that Gary is hiding in his fancy boot. Gary comes crashing out of the boot, and spins around, while a bucket and soap come down on Gary. When SpongeBob takes the bucket off of Gary, he finds that Gary has soap in his mouth, and manages to take it out now hearing Gary's gasps. SpongeBob thinks for a minute that Gary is not hurt, and then touches Gary's shell, as it breaks.SpongeBob apologizes to Gary. Gary meows, smells his own stink, feels pain, and begins to cry. SpongeBob grabs Gary and tries to hug him, but Gary refuses and goes up to the ceiling in more pain. Later, SpongeBob tries to find out how to fix Gary's shell, first by taping it back together, although it breaks once again.In the bedroom, where SpongeBob goes through his trunk to find solutions for Gary, he first finds his Hawaiian shirt, but realizes it does not work. He then finds his Christmas Santa hat, but realizes that it is too last season.  He later finds his gorilla mask, but he needs this for Halloween. SpongeBob first finds his copy of his pants, and tries them on Gary, but they get wet and drop. Next, SpongeBob finds his space helmet by trying it on his head, and then Gary but realizes it does not look right. SpongeBob later finds his race car helmet, and puts it on Gary now realizing that Gary rocks. Gary throws it off and shows him a Shell Spiffy magazine, which is a magazine full of snail shells. Gary meows at SpongeBob to take a look at page 72, which features his old shell with many new features, and the cost is $9,595.95. SpongeBob wonders where he can get a high quality shell without spending a fortune. Gary knows where to get a shell very cheap, and shows SpongeBob a commercial which now features Scooter cleaning up his snail's broken shell, which is for Angry Jack's Shell Emporium, where the prices are always very cheap. Angry Jack introduces himself through the television, and advertises a commercial full of shells which include a refurbished plastic shell, and gets angry with the numbers in his face, along with the other shells.Angry Jack starts talking about selling for real. When SpongeBob and Gary get to the Shell Emporium, they interrupt Angry Jack in the commercial. SpongeBob apologizes to Angry Jack, thinking that he is going to get angry. Angry Jack reveals that he just does it for the commercial to make them louder and better. Jack then finds a shell that looks exactly like Gary's old one, and tries it on Gary, which makes him very happy. SpongeBob thinks it is perfect, and wants to buy it for Gary because it looks like his old one. The shell then slides off of Gary and breaks, which makes him depressed once again. Jack then decides to try a different shell on Gary. SpongeBob wants to take it, and decides to make sure that it is put down by pushing down on it harder. He manages to break it, which makes Gary mad at him again. He manages to grab another shell, but accidentally breaks it over Jack's face. SpongeBob manages to grab another shell off of the shelf, but trips over his shoe laces, causing it to break. Jack hands over Gary to SpongeBob in order to take care of the shells, and tries on the reflective model on Gary. The reflection blinds both SpongeBob and Gary. After being almost blind, SpongeBob accidentally starts to break all of the shells (at least 3,000) in the store. Jack gives SpongeBob one more shell which is proven indestructible. SpongeBob makes sure that his hand and shoes are perfect, and wraps them up in bubble wrap and tape, but the shell manages to slip through the bubble wrap, and breaks.SpongeBob mentions about reducing inventory, which makes Jack angry for real, and demands immediate payment. SpongeBob hands Jack some quarters, and Jack demands one arm and legs, also a heart and one eyeball, and his pants.Later, SpongeBob is walking while carrying Gary, wishing that his shell would grow back the way SpongeBob's appendages can, and then finds a square cardboard box in front of a dumpster, he draws on it, and it becomes Gary's replacement shell. Unfortunately, Gary is more depressed and he and SpongeBob both break down in tears. Mr. Krabs comes out from the dumpster and SpongeBob immediately has an idea. SpongeBob wants Mr. Krabs to help him find a new shell for Gary. Mr. Krabs manages to shake SpongeBob upside down to find some money to help Gary get a new shell. Mr. Krabs starts to walk away as SpongeBob manages to make a deal to work for free for the rest of the year. Mr. Krabs decides that he wants to cut SpongeBob's health insurance and SpongeBob makes the deal.That night at SpongeBob's house, he has another nightmare while his teeth are chattering once again. He turns on his flashlight and sees Mr. Krabs' shell on Gary. However, he sees Mr. Krabs coming in through the window very cold, and wants to borrow a blanket. After giving Mr. Krabs a blanket, SpongeBob manages to smart off his mouth to Gary about the shell. Then Gary, once again annoyed, locks SpongeBob outside and turns off the light in the house."

   "[The episode starts with SpongeBob lying in bed with his teeth chattering. He hears a crash and sits up, awake. He thinks he imagined it and sighs with relief, but then there's another crashing sound. He picks up the phone to call for help.] SpongeBob: Hello? Hello! [realizes the phone line is cut] Huh? The line\u2019s been cut. [slams the phone down] Barnacles! [puts on an army helmet and gets out a tennis racket] I guess I\u2019d go better take a look. [gets up and legs start shaking] [shakes around tennis racket] Who's there? Stay back, I'm armed! [slips on a toy fire truck] Whoa! Whoa! [falls down stairs] Ha, hey! [flicks on the light switch. Novelty teeth chattering] Aha, wind-up novelty teeth! How did you wind up down here? Dahaha! [fancy boot runs in circles] What the heck is going on with my fancy boot? [goes over to fancy boot] Hey, knock it off! [boot goes in circles faster] Alright, I warned you! [whacks boot. The racket comes back around and hits SpongeBob in the face] You're a dirty fighter... I got you now! Hiya! [karate chops boot. Gary bounces out] Gary? [heads towards a sand castle near the wall] Noooooooooo! [Gary crashes underneath the bucket with soap in it] Gary! [lifts off bucket, where Gary lets out a soapy meow, and SpongeBob removes the soap from Gary\u2019s mouth] Phew! Thank goodness. For a minute, I thought you were hurt. [pats his shell, which breaks] [shocked] Gary, I've - I've broken your shell. Gary: Meoooow! [starts crying in pain] SpongeBob: Oh no, you're in pain! Don't worry, I'll make it better. [gives Gary a tight hug and Gary screams] Sorry about that. Oh, I know, [picks up the cracks from Gary's shell] here, just use a little tape and there ya go, good as new! [shell breaks off] Oh. Well, that's alright, because we'll find a new shell for ya. [later] SpongeBob: How about this? [holds up green Hawaiian shirt with orange flowers on it] Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Yeah, you're right, too gaudy. [pulls out a Santa hat] No, too last season. [pulls out a gorilla mask] Well, I need that. Ahahaha, look, Gary! [pulls out a pair of SquarePants] Here, try this on for size. Gary: Meow... SpongeBob: Of course it's a shell. [Gary looks at him sternly] Aw, come on, don't look at me like that. [the flesh on Gary's back covers the pants and the wet pants go soggy] Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Okay, you're right, it's not a shell. [starts thinking] Oh! [comes back with a clear helmet over his head] Greetings, earthling, I am SpongeBob. I come from the future. Dahahaha. [takes off helmet] I bet this'll look great. [puffy flesh swirls up inside the helmet] Ew. I can see why snail shells aren't clear. [takes the helmet from Gary] Hmmm. Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Here it is, Gary, your new shell! [puts on a race driver helmet] Oh, you look ready to ride. [Gary throws a magazine at him] \"Shell Spiffy.\" Great idea, Gare, I'll order you a new shell. Are there any you have your mind on, ol' buddy? [shows Gary the magazine] Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Oh, page seventy-two. Here it is - wow! [looks the same as Gary's old shell] \"This stylish fully insulated, dual coat ceramic shell comes with automatic rest-room facilities standard, and for the affordable price of just... 9595.95\"!? Isn't there a place I can get a quality shell without spending a fortune? Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Commercial? What commercial? [looks at the TV, where a commercial is playing] Commercial Voice: Uh-oh, now look what you've done. You've broke your snail's shell again. Actor: Yeah. Now what do I do? Angry Jack: You come on down to Angry Jack's Shell Emporium! Commercial Voice: [drop scene with shop name on it] Angry Jack's! Angry Jack: I'm so angry about my massive inventory that I'm slashing prices like crazy. Commercial Voice: Jack's angry! Angry Jack: Ninety-nine ninety-nine, buy this refurbished shell and I'm angry about it. [holds up a pink shell] Or what about this one? Brand new plastic shell, super gloss coat, only thirty-nine ninety-nine. [the price flashes in front of his eyes] Hey! Get those numbers outta my face! [the price then disappears] Did I mention I'm angry? Commercial Voice: He's seething with rage! Angry Jack: The wife's gone for good, so I'm gonna sell sell sell all these shell shell shells! So come on down to Angry Jack's now. Commercial Voice: Jack is real mad! Don't bring your kids. Angry Jack: And remember, I'll match or beat anyone's advertised rage or your shell is absolutely [angry voice] \u2013 [notices SpongeBob] Hey, what are you doing in my commercial? [now with a normal voice] SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, Angry Jack. Gary here needs a new shell, and we knew you would help us find one. Hey, shouldn't you be yelling at me right now? Angry Jack: Nah, I just do that to make my commercials louder. And louder is the same as better! Now, let's see if I can't get you into a new shell. Hmmm. [starts scanning the shelves] There she is! [takes the same shell as Gary's old one] There you are, little guy. Gary: [happily] Meow! SpongeBob: Oh, it's perfect! Just like the old one hey, buddy? [the shell falls off and breaks] Now, it... really looks like the old one, eh, buddy? Gary: [offendedly] Meow reow... Angry Jack: Hey, accidents will happen. Why don't we try this one? [picks up a yellow shell with orange patches] SpongeBob: Oooohh, that's nice, love the pattern. We'll take it. But first, I've gotta make sure it's battened down. We don't want this one slippin' off, eh, buddy? [pushes down the shell so hard, then it cracks and breaks. Angry Jack looks at him angrily] Oops. Hey, what about that one? [walks to a shell with purple and orange stripes on it. He turns around to take it to Gary, but whacks it on Angry Jack] Oops, sorry, Jack. Hey, how much is that one? [picks up shades of pink stripes. He tries to take it to Gary but his shoes are untied so he trips over lace and drops the shell, breaking it] Angry Jack: Why don't you just hold your snail? I'll take care of the shells. SpongeBob: Good idea, Angry. Angry Jack: So, how do ya like this one? [puts on a very bright-lighted shell] SpongeBob: Well, it... certainly is shiny. Angry Jack: It's our most reflective model. SpongeBob: Oh, that is bright. [stumbles backwards] Can't... see! Ow, what was that? 'Scuse me. [bashes into the shell shelves and knocks them over one by one. The shelves knock each other over like dominoes. Some shell shelves spell 'oops'] Why \u2013 can't \u2013 I \u2013 stop \u2013 breaking \u2013 shells?! [screams and falls off the shelf he was running along. View from outside Angry Jack's store] Whoops. Say, Jack, I don't suppose you have any more to show me? Angry Jack: I do have one more available. It's the only certified indestructible shell I've ever seen, but I'm sure you'll find a way. SpongeBob: Wait, wait, wait. Before we do the hand-off, let me make some precautionary measures. Okay, first, [shoes pop from under shell bits] shoes are tied. Hands are dry. [pulls out a roll of bubble wrap] And now, a thick layer of bubble wrap. [starts wrapping the shell in bubble wrap. He picks up the shell, but the actual shell falls out of the bubble wrap layer and breaks] You, um, you sure you don't have any more in the back? Angry Jack: The back? There is no back anymore. SpongeBob: Well, look on the bright side. I reduced your inventory for you. Angry Jack: Reduced?! You destroyed everything! And now, you're gonna have to pay! SpongeBob: Are you really angry or ya just trying to sound louder? Angry Jack: I'm really angry! Commercial Voice: Blistering fury! Angry Jack: And I demand immediate payment! SpongeBob: [takes about forty cents out his pocket] Take it, it's all my savings. Angry Jack: This? This isn't enough to repay my fortune! I'm gonna need more. SpongeBob: Sorry, that's all I got. Honest. Angry Jack: No, it's not. You've got two arms and two legs, don't ya? SpongeBob: Yeah. Angry Jack: Gimme one of each. SpongeBob: Okay. [does so] Angry Jack: I'll also need some internal organs. [SpongeBob hands one over] And an eyeball. [SpongeBob gives him an eyeball] And your clothes. [cut to SpongeBob walking in Bikini Bottom carrying a still shell-less Gary] SpongeBob: [sadly] Oh, Gary. How I wish your shell could grow back like my appendages. [sees a box] Hey, I've got an idea! [draws a shell pattern on the box] Gary: [angry tone] Meow. SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, it's not that bad! Square looks good on anybody! [Gary starts to cry, so SpongeBob does, too] Oh, who am I kidding? It looks terrible on you! I know, Gary, I ruined your life! Do you have to rub it in?! [Mr. Krabs pokes his head of of the dumpster behind them] Mr. Krabs: Hey, what's with all that sniveling? SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here? Mr. Krabs: Well, I just, - oh - well, um... never mind that, boy. What's your problem? SpongeBob: I destroyed Gary's shell, and now I can't find a replacement, so I guess he'll just spend the rest of his days as a lowly slug! [bawls] Gary: Meow. Mr. Krabs: There there, boy, there there. It's not that bad. I'm sure you'll think of something. SpongeBob: [suddenly gets an idea] Mr. Krabs, perhaps you can help me find a new shell for Gary. Mr. Krabs: Well, I'd be honored to help you and your snivelin' snail during such desperate times, 'cause I love helping others, like helping myself. Now, how much ya got? SpongeBob: Nothing, Mr. Krabs. I'm broke. Mr. Krabs: Oh. I see. [walks away disappointed] SpongeBob: Wait, Mr. Krabs! If you help me get Gary a shell, I'll, work for free for the rest of the year. Mr. Krabs: Only if I get to cut your health benefit for ya. SpongeBob: Deal! [they high five. Cut to SpongeBob's house; his teeth are chattering, and he wakes up again] Another bad dream. [sees a scary silhouette] Aaargh! [shines a flashlight at Gary] Mr. Krabs? Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Sorry, Gary, I'm not used to your new shell. [something pink and fleshy enters through SpongeBob's bedroom window] Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, me boy, I need to borrow a blanket. SpongeBob: There ya go, Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs: Thanks, boyo. Now I'm all toasty. SpongeBob: Ahh. I guess \"all's shell that ends shell,\" huh, Gary? Dahahah! That's a good one. [Gary goes furious and crawls back, Gary slams the door locking SpongeBob out] Gary? [pounds on the door] Gary? [Gary turns off the bedroom light] Gary?"

  "synopsis": [
   "The episode starts with the mailman walking to Patrick's rock, about to deliver his new rock. When Patrick unveils it, he realizes that it is not the one he ordered. The rock ends up crushing the mailman, with Patrick telling him that he cannot deliver mail in his current condition, so he throws the mailman into his rock while he decides to deliver the mail in his place. Patrick goes to SpongeBob's house and tells SpongeBob about his new duty. He soon allows SpongeBob to help him deliver mail around Bikini Bottom.SpongeBob and Patrick first stop by Squidward's house, and SpongeBob rings the doorbell. Patrick gives Squidward his package, which Squidward opens to reveal a turbo clarinet. He uses it to blow SpongeBob and Patrick away into downtown Bikini Bottom. They land in front of a pickle-based building and try to get the mail through the mail slot, but the envelope repeatedly comes back to them. SpongeBob rings the doorbell and Kevin answers, only to turn down their delivery. SpongeBob suggests that he and Patrick should move on, but Patrick vows to make their delivery successful.SpongeBob and Patrick leave the package in front of the building. Patrick comes out of the package, but Kevin launches him away. SpongeBob and Patrick try to go through the roof, with Patrick disguised as Santa. He falls down the chimney and lands in the fireplace. Kevin refuses to take the envelope and tries to run from Patrick, but he pulls Kevin back inside. The two then fight with jellyfish nets and Patrick ends up catching Kevin and giving him the envelope. He sees that the envelope was meant for Bubble Bass and slams his front door, revealing Bubble Bass behind it as he treads away.SpongeBob and Patrick go to Old Man Walker's house and attempt to deliver his mail, but they cannot find anything for him. They feel sad for him, so they give him another envelope. Old Man Walker opens it to see a foreclosure letter, thinking he has been drafted. SpongeBob and Patrick give him more mail, making him explode in joy. While walking through Bikini Bottom, they see that they are out of mail. They see a mail truck and hijack it to deliver more mail. A mailwoman sees her truck stolen, and calls for more mailmen to chase after SpongeBob and Patrick.SpongeBob and Patrick continue giving mail away while being chased down. The mailmen jump onto the hijacked truck, and SpongeBob and Patrick throw packages at them, launching them away. They drop more mail to cause the other mail trucks to slip away from them, and launch mail towards a helicopter to drive it away from them. Furious, Kevin throws away another jury summons letter for Bubble Bass, who runs away after the helicopter uncovers his barrel hideout. SpongeBob and Patrick drive into a post office, and end up being delivered to a jail warden, as the episode ends."

   "[The episode begins with the mailman walking down the street whistling, delivering mail to Patrick's house. The mailman puts his left hand in his mailbag and takes out a huge package that resembles a rock. He is struggling to hold the giant package and sweats as he's doing so.] Mailman: Special delivery! [Patrick opens up his rock house and is seen attached to the bottom of it.] Patrick: Ooh! My new rock is finally here! [Patrick slides down from his rock and runs over to open it. Patrick rips off the wrapping paper whole and the package is revealed to be a pink rock with green polka dots on it with a bronze arrow-shaped weather vane on top.] Patrick: [putting his hands on his hips while looking suspicious] Hold on. [Patrick jumps up onto the rock and puts his glasses on] Patrick: Polka dots?! I ordered plaid! [Patrick takes his glasses off and throws them away.] Patrick: You'll have to take it back, Mr. Mailman. Mailman: [still struggling to hold up the rock] Back? [The rock crushes the mailman and letters come flying out. Patrick lifts up the rock and the mailman is flattened into the ground with black eyes.] Patrick: Mr. Mailman? Mailman: My back! [Patrick picks up the mailman and puts his hat to his mouth and blows into it like a balloon. The mailman is back to normal and Patrick puts him back down feet first on the ground.] [The mailman is groaning in pain.] Patrick: [while adjusting the mailman's hat] You okay, buddy? Mailman: Gotta... deliver... mail. Patrick: You are in no shape to deliver anything, fella. Just relax and [throws the mailman to Patrick's rock] crash at my place. I'll deliver your mail for you today. [his rock closes. Patrick walks off just to run back] Oops! [opens his rock] Almost forgot my mailbag. [grabs it from the mailman and walks off, as his rock automatically closes again. He runs back and opens the rock again] Oops! [grabs a hat from the mailman] Almost forgot my mailman hat! [his rock automatically closes yet again. Patrick hums] All righty. [searches for mail in the bag] Let's see where my first [takes out an envelope] delivery is! [struggles to read the envelope and shoves it onto his eyes] D'oh, I can't read this! [the camera pans to SpongeBob's house. Patrick bangs his head on the door four times and becomes dizzy] SpongeBob: [opens his door] Hey, Patrick. I thought that sounded like your head. Patrick: SpongeBob! Do you know where this [struggling to read SpongeBob's name on the envelope] Spon-gee-Boob Squir-pa-Nants lives? SpongeBob: Never heard of him. Patrick: [crumbles the envelope] Oh, well. [throws the crumbled envelope] Return to sender. SpongeBob: Hey, what's with the new [flicks Patrick's hat] threads? Patrick: I'm... [he is shown to be more muscular] a mailman now! [giggles] SpongeBob: Wow! I've always wanted to be a mailman. It's like getting to be [Jingle bell sounds are heard.] Santa every day! Except Sundays. Patrick: Sorry, SpongeBob, but I'm the mailman now. SpongeBob: [disappointed] Oh, okay. Patrick: [holding a small package with a tied string.] But you can be my [pulls the string to reveal another mailman hat] postal pal! SpongeBob: [confetti comes out of his ears] Whee! [grabs the hat and puts it on] Oh, ah! Patrick: [his face is shown in front of a real starfish] Let's [the camera zooms out to him and SpongeBob, who is wearing sunglasses] get mailing. [puts on sunglasses] [They walk to Squidward's house.] Patrick: Postal pal, you may ring the doorbell. [gestures to Squidward's doorbell] SpongeBob: [gasps excitedly and runs to the doorbell] Yes sir, Mr. Mailman, sir! Ooh, I better warm up the ol' bell ringer. [moves his finger up and down twice] Up, down, up, down. [twists his finger right] Twist right, [twists his finger left] twist left. And... [puts nail polish on his finger] polish the nail. [SpongeBob inhales and blows to his finger. He finally rings the doorbell, and Squidward opens the door.] Patrick: [shouting] Mail! [SpongeBob crouches and Patrick offers a package to Squidward above SpongeBob's head.] Squidward: They let a moron like you deliver the mail? Patrick: Oh, you'd be surprised what they let morons do. Squidward: [gasps, then takes the package] It's here! It's here! [laughs as he opens the package] Patrick: What's wrong with Squidward's face? [Squidward's face is shown as creepily happy. Hyena laughing sounds are heard.] SpongeBob: [while Squidward is still opening the package] I think he's... smiling. Squidward: I finally got it! [holds it up] My turbo clarinet! [pulls the motor's recoil start twice and blows into it] SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa! [they are sent flying away until they hit a flower cloud and fall down] Squidward: Worth every penny. [SpongeBob and Patrick crash onto the road to Kevin's house.] Patrick: Oh, good, our next stop. SpongeBob: [looking for an envelope until he pulls one out] A summons for jury duty! Lucky. [hands the envelope to Patrick] Patrick: Special delivery! [delivers the envelope into the door mail slot] SpongeBob: Great job, Mr. Mailman. [the envelope retracts to Patrick's butt] Oops. [runs to the door and grabs the envelope off of Patrick's butt and delivers the envelope to the mail slot, but it retracts into one of his pores. He holds out his tongue, revealing the envelope on it] Must be a defective mail slot. [uses his tongue as a hand to deliver the envelope into the mail slot] That oughta do it. [the envelope retracts and slices SpongeBob and stops on Patrick's belly. SpongeBob's body slides off and he puts it back on him] Maybe I'll just try the doorbell. [he swirls his finger and rings the doorbell] Kevin: [opens the door, unamused] Can I help you? SpongeBob and Patrick: Special delivery! Kevin: I don't want it! [slams the door] SpongeBob: [he and Patrick look at each other] Maybe we should just move on to the next house. Patrick: Pfft, no. I am a mailman. Like the postal oath says, neither bunions or onions, nor ditches or dangers, will stop me from giving stuff to strangers! [SpongeBob applauds] [Bubble transition to the next scene with SpongeBob delivering a package to Kevin's front porch. SpongeBob rings the doorbell from a distance. Kevin opens the door.] Kevin: [notices the package] Ah! Patrick: [comes out of the package with an envelope] Special delivery! [Kevin growls in anger] Kevin: Special un -delivery! [presses a button on a remote, triggering the springboard, which launches Patrick away] Patrick: [comes out of the box injured] Being a mailman isn't like being Santa Claus at all. [SpongeBob gets an idea with a red Christmas lightbulb over his head. Snowflake transition to SpongeBob as a reindeer climbing towards the roof with his sleigh carrying Patrick as Santa Claus.] Patrick: Ho ho ho! [leaps on SpongeBob and down the chimney] [The scene cuts to Kevin drinking juice and reading as the camera pans to Patrick falling to the fireplace and soot covers the screen until it clears. Kevin now has a soot beard.] Patrick: Hey, we're beard bros. [Kevin growls and shakes the soot beard off of him] Oh, uh, [pulls out the envelope] merry Fishmas! Kevin: It's July ! Patrick: [hands him the envelope] Just take the letter! Kevin: I don't [smacks it away] want it! [starts to run] Patrick: Neither bunions or onions! [chases Kevin as his Santa costume comes off] [Kevin runs and slides under his table and Patrick slides in mid-air and notices pie on the table. He stops and eats a slice.] Patrick: [while him and the envelope are still in mid-air] Ah. [grabs the envelope and screams. Kevin is seen trying to escape through his window] Take [grabs Kevin and slams him into the ground] your mail! [elbow smashes Kevin which causes them to get into a dust brawl cloud fight as they enter another room] I'll zip your code so hard! Kevin: [escapes the dust cloud brawl fight and grabs a jellyfishing net] En garde! Patrick: [grabs a jellyfish net as well] En lard! [They both charge at each other while screaming and starting sword-fighting each other with the nets.] Patrick: I'm gonna stamp you! I'll send you butt express! [hits Kevin with his butt as he files into a knight outfit] [Patrick tries to hit Kevin with the net, but he jumps and hits Patrick's head. Kevin jumps out of the costume and charges up his run on Patrick and takes off. Patrick's head sticks back up and notices Kevin running away.] Patrick: You can't run from your civic duties! [chases after Kevin, bounces on a jellyfish plush, and hangs on a chandelier. It breaks and he lands on Kevin] [As dust clears, Patrick is seen holding the jellyfishing net, which has Kevin in it.] Patrick: Oh! [puts the envelope on Kevin's mouth] Get it! Slap back, no take backs! [Kevin slides down to the ground. SpongeBob and Patrick are then seen walking out of Kevin's house.] Patrick: Not bad. Kevin: [walks out his door and spits out the envelope and reads the address] This summons is for Bubble Bass, you nincompoops! [rips up the envelope and slams the door in frustration. Bubble Bass is seen hiding beside the door and scatters away. Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick going to the next house. Patrick rings the doorbell but it falls apart] Old Man Walker: [inside the house] Coming. [Panicking, Patrick tries to fix the doorbell, then passes it to SpongeBob.] Old Man Walker: Don't leave. [SpongeBob puts the broken parts of the doorbell in Patrick's mouth.] Old Man Walker: Almost there. [SpongeBob takes out a roll of tape then takes the broken parts out and tape them to the house, then Old Man Walker opens the door.] Old Man Walker: Oh boy! I never get visitors! SpongeBob: [as Patrick is searching through the bag for mail] Special delivery, for one special old man. Patrick: I can't find any mail for him. Old Man Walker: [sadly] Oh, I never get any mail. SpongeBob: [in tears] That's so sad. let's give him some of the other mail, huh? [takes out an envelope and writes \"OLD MAN WALKER\" on it with a marker] I found a letter for you, Old Man Walker. [As Old Man Walker reads the letter, his eyes tear up, and they count down from three. They shoot out tears and go back to normal. He rips up the envelope.] Old Man Walker: I've been drafted! Oh, boy! [the letter is shown to read \"FORECLOSED\"] SpongeBob: Wow, if one letter made him this happy, I bet all of the mail will make him explode with joy. [they give Old Man Walker all of the mail] Old Man Walker: Wow, all of this for me? [his head explodes and confetti comes out of it] [SpongeBob and Patrick dance and laugh around the confetti. Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick walking downtown. Patrick is chewing on some mail.] SpongeBob: What's next, Postman Patrick? Patrick: [swallows the mail and shakes the mail bag to see it is empty] Aw, we're all out of mail. [A mail truck drives by and stops.] Patrick: [pointing] Let's ask that ice cream truck if it knows where to find some mail. SpongeBob: That's no ice cream truck. It's a mail truck. Patrick: Really? I thought all trucks were girls. [SpongeBob and Patrick goofily salute the mail woman as she opens the back of the truck. She glares at them and walks away. SpongeBob and Patrick giggle and jump into the back of the truck and drive away.] SpongeBob: [popping out of a mail bag] Wow, we hit the postal jackpot! Patrick: [driving, looking behind him] Cool. [The mail truck drives by, and the mail woman notices.] Mail woman: Huh? Hey! [pointing] Those weirdos stole my truck! [kicks the envelope button on the mailbox, summoning an alarm] [Several mail trucks appear, along with a mail helicopter. The mail woman is given a rope ladder and climbs onto it.] Mail woman: Follow those postal pilferers! Patrick: [driving by, leaving behind lots of mail] A special delivery! SpongeBob: Special delivery for Fred! [throws an envelope in Fred's direction, who is about to kiss a woman when it lands in between them] Woman: Huh? [reads the envelope and growls] Who's Carol? [Fred chuckles as Carol is seen with the couple's drinks on a plate. Cut back to SpongeBob, who is holding a package.] SpongeBob: This one's for you, Penny! [throws the package at Penny] [Penny, a rollerskating child, gets hit with the package and falls off the bridge screaming. The package rips apart to reveal an orange raft.] Penny: Huh? [lands on a current] Oh, great. The raft I ordered has finally arrived. [she screams again once she realizes she is going down a waterfall] [SpongeBob and Patrick are still in the mail truck, and several mail trucks catch up to them. The mail helicopter flies above the mail truck as two mail people land on top of the mail truck.] Patrick: Huh? [screams] Pirates! SpongeBob and Patrick: [see the mail people] Wha-? [the mail people growl at them] Patrick: Why are these pirates dressed like mail people? SpongeBob: They want to [points] steal our mail! Patrick: Repel the boarders! SpongeBob: [salutes] Repelling boarders, sir! [throws a package at the mailman, sending him flying off] Mail woman: Harold! [a package is thrown at her as well, also sending her flying] Whee! [SpongeBob observes the mail trucks behind them.] SpongeBob: [pulling a level] I'm shipping these COD: [the mail truck raises its back end and litters all of the mail onto the road] Crash on delivery. [The two mail trucks slip and crash into each other. The mail helicopter swoops in, frightening SpongeBob.] SpongeBob: [noticing the mail bag next to him] And here comes some air mail. [puts all of the mail from the bag into bis mouth and turns into a cannon] [SpongeBob shoots the mail onto the windshield of the helicopter, making the mail driver scream. The helicopter tilts to the side.] Kevin: [picks up an envelope and reads it] Huh? Another jury summons for Bubble Bass. [crumples up the letter and throws it into a barrel] [The helicopter comes by and slices the barrel in half, revealing Bubble Bass huddled inside. He runs away. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick are still being chased by mail trucks.] Patrick: Special delivery! SpongeBob: [about to throw more mail, but notices something] Oh, all we have left is junk mail! Patrick: [off-screen] Don't worry. They'll never find us in this post office. [Their mail truck enters the post office, and the envelope door closes. The mail trucks stop. Envelope transition to the mailman on crutches, trudging his way to the entrance to the Bikini Bottom Jail. He rings the doorbell and a foghorn sounds. The door opens to reveal a jail warden.] Mailman: Here's today's [holds out a giant envelope with SpongeBob and Patrick inside] mail, warden. SpongeBob and Patrick: Special delivery. [both giggle as the episode ends]"

  "synopsis": [
   "As the episode begins, SpongeBob runs towards Patrick's house, ready to go jellyfishing. Patrick says he will go with him, but must put away his \"secret box\" first. SpongeBob tries to peek inside, but Patrick refuses to let him see. SpongeBob entices Patrick by sharing his own secrets, but this only convinces Patrick to keep his secret box even more closely guarded. SpongeBob tries to distract him with many of his own secret possessions, but Patrick only pays attention to his own box.As Patrick explains the lengths he must go to keep his box safe, he fails to notice SpongeBob sneaking off with it, giddily preparing to look. Patrick stops him just in time and struggles with SpongeBob over the box. The sight of SpongeBob's arms popping off while still desperately clinging to the box disgusts Patrick, making him question the validity of their membership in the Best Friends Forever Club. He threatens to end their friendship if SpongeBob continues trying to look at his secret. SpongeBob begs Patrick for his forgiveness and promises to respect Patrick's right to secrecy, and they remain friends.That night, SpongeBob cannot sleep, still thinking about Patrick's secret box and wondering about its contents. He convinces himself that sneaking into Patrick's house while he is asleep would prevent Patrick from getting upset and he will be able to look at the secret without feeling guilty. Despite Gary's admonitions, SpongeBob puts his plan into action, pulling on a silk stocking for a mask and slipping under Patrick's rock.Inside, the box lays in full view on Patrick's nightstand. Trying to tiptoe across a floor covered in potato chips, SpongeBob fears waking Patrick with every step. Finally making it to the bedside, SpongeBob reaches for the box but Patrick sleepily grabs hold of it. SpongeBob, conveniently cube-shaped, gently slips himself in place of the box just as Patrick attempts to take something from it, yanking SpongeBob's tongue in the process. Patrick then places SpongeBob next to him on the bed, allowing SpongeBob to get back onto the floor. As he prepares to leave, SpongeBob trips on his shoelace and begins crashing and bouncing around the rock in a cacophony of noise, culminating in slamming against the wall and breaking a framed photo of him and Patrick in half. Despite all of this, Patrick remains fast asleep.SpongeBob quietly remarks how heavy a sleeper Patrick is, which causes Patrick to finally wake up and catch the masked SpongeBob with the box. Thinking him to be the \"Clam Burglar,\" Patrick prepares to assault him with a pillow until SpongeBob confirms his identity with his Best Friends Forever ring. In shock and distraught, Patrick declares their friendship to be over. Immediately afterwards, Patrick changes his mind and finally allows SpongeBob look inside the box.SpongeBob eagerly opens the box, only to find a piece of string. Thanking Patrick for letting him look, SpongeBob heads home, laughing at how he should not have been surprised. Alone once more, Patrick ponders alone the true secret nature of the box: when the string is pulled, a secret compartment opens and reveals an embarrassing picture of SpongeBob at a Christmas party, and Patrick laughs at it, joking a Merry Christmas to SpongeBob, not that it matters as the two houses are out of earshot, thus ending the episode."

   "SpongeBob: [as he runs to Patrick's rock] Patrick! Patrick! Oh, Patrick! Are you ready to go jellyfishing? [Patrick comes out of his rock with a box, doing an acrobatic trick] Patrick: Oh, boy, am I! SpongeBob: Here's your net. [Patrick glances at his box] Well, come on, Patrick! The jellyfish don't catch themselves. Patrick: First, I have to put away my secret box. SpongeBob: Secret box? You never told me about your... secret box! [tries to peek in the box, but Patrick pulls it away] Patrick: Hey, hands off, PeepingBob! This here is my secret box! Besides, if I showed you what was inside, it wouldn't be a secret anymore. Duh! [opens the box, laughs at it, and shuts it as SpongeBob tries to peek it] Oh, SpongeBob\u2026 if only you could see what's inside my secret box, it would change your life! [SpongeBob gets behind Patrick to see what's inside the box, but Patrick holds it to himself] SpongeBob: It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets. Patrick: You do? SpongeBob: I've got a gazillion secrets! Patrick: Like what? SpongeBob: Well, it's no secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly. [Patrick drools as the top of his head has lightning bolts coming out of it, showing that he couldn't understand the whole sentence] SpongeBob: You wanna hear one of my secrets? Patrick: Do I? SpongeBob: Uhh... Let's see... [runs up to Patrick] Did you know that you're my best friend? [runs away] Patrick: No... way. Oh, let's hear another one! SpongeBob: Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit na\u00efve. Patrick: Wow! I'll never look at you the same way again, SpongeBob. Gosh. [SpongeBob clears his throat and taps on Patrick's box] Tell me some more secrets! SpongeBob: Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think jellyfishing and bubble-blowing are the sea bee's knees... [transition to SpongeBob still telling secrets as Patrick lays his head on the box] ...I have a slight overbite. I've never been late for work, I've said the word \"fancy\" in conversation, I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear, right now. [he shows his three pairs of underwear to Patrick] Patrick: Gasp. I never would have guessed. SpongeBob: Now will you show me what's inside your secret box? Patrick: No, SpongeBob! It's for me to know and for you to never find out. You may be an open book, SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma. [imagines a carton of milk spilling itself] SpongeBob: Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty of secret stuff, too! Uh\u2026 [close-up of SpongeBob's socks] I've got my secret socks on. [runs away and comes back with Gary's bowl] And my secret Gary's bowl! [runs away then comes back, pushing his television] My secret TV! [turns on the TV] And my secret TV channel. [the TV shows an off-air color bars screen] What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick? Patrick: [giggles, then laughs loudly after a gander at the box and then stops to breathe. Then he looks again and laughs harder and wildly. Then he stops to breathe] Maybe if you saw what was inside, you'd know why it has to be secret. [shows the box to SpongeBob] Inside this very box is the most secret-y secret of all of secret-dom and I am its sole witness! It's a heavy burden, SpongeBob, but nobody must know the mystery of the box. [SpongeBob tries to peek inside the box, but Patrick slams it shut] Nobody! Not even\u2026 Squidward's house. [scene zooms out to show Squidward's Tiki Head home looking down at SpongeBob and Patrick, who notice this before it goes back to normal] It's a full-time job. I'm constantly on the alert. You never know when someone's gonna\u2026 [gasps when he finds out his box is gone. The scene cuts to a laughing SpongeBob running with Patrick's secret box, but then he bumps into Patrick's belly] SpongeBob, what do you think you're doing?! That's my secret box! Now, hand it over! SpongeBob: [struggles with Patrick on the box] But, Patrick, I must know the secret! Patrick: [struggles with SpongeBob on the box] For the last time, SpongeBob, no! SpongeBob: Come on, just a peek? Patrick: Never! [SpongeBob and Patrick strain as they fight over the box. Eventually, SpongeBob's arms pop off and he gasps] So, it's come to this. And to think that we joined the Best Friends Forever Club! [shows his finger with the ring on it and then the camera zooms in on the ring. He grabs one of SpongeBob's arms and points it at SpongeBob] Listen up, SpongeBob SecretStealerPants! [as he pokes SpongeBob's nose with his arm] If you ever come near my secret box again, we won't be friends anymore! SpongeBob: But... we're supposed to be... [his eyes get big and sad] friends forever. [flashback to SpongeBob and Patrick as babies in a crib laughing, then we see them as kids riding on a bike, then as they are now, riding a bike, then as older men in rocking chairs, then we see a shot of two gravestones with their names and we hear SpongeBob and Patrick still laughing, but they are buried. The flashback ends.] I feel so filthy! [starts to cry] I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself! [jumps on Patrick] I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please! Patrick: Well... I guess it's not all your fault. After all, this is a pretty great secret. I mean, how could you resist the greatest secret ever? [we see a close-up of Patrick's box] The most amazing... [as he sticks the box in SpongeBob's eyes, the eyes pop out of him and then back in] mysterious... powerful secret in all Bikini Bottom. [his eyes are glued to the box for a moment, and then goes back to him] SpongeBob: So, what do you say, buddy? Friends? Patrick: Friends. [they shake hands. Cuts to a night view of SpongeBob's house, then inside as SpongeBob talks] SpongeBob: What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish... [slides down in his bed] or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds. [sits up] Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victims' severed heads in a box! [hides himself in the blanket and shivers] Or even worse... Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party! [screams, then hurls himself towards the bedroom window] I'm gonna find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest till I do! [SpongeBob's face pops off and sticks onto his back] That's it! How do you look into a secret box? [jumps off the window] Secretly, of course; I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look inside, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back. [turns around to show only his nose, then turns back around] Patrick won't know, and I'll have my own little secret! Good idea, eh, Gary? [Gary narrows his eyes] Gary: Meeh-No. [cut to the outside] SpongeBob: Oh, what do you know? You're a snail! [sneaks over to Patrick's house, puts on gloves and a ski mask, crawls up the rock with his back, and tears him in half and gets both halves under the rock. He then lands and notices Patrick. He then screams gibberish, drools and SpongeBob hides behind the portrait of SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob then peeks and then the wall starts to crack. Patrick mumbles, the wall breaks even more and then the nail falls off. He then grabs the nail with his foot and puts it back.] Patrick: [as the camera zooms in on the box] Seee... cret. SpongeBob: [thinking] I got to be more quiet. I don't want to wake Patrick up. [slides down the wall from the portrait and makes a loud noise upon touching the floor. Patrick stretches and then goes back to sleep. SpongeBob then lifts his leg and then Patrick makes another noise. He then tosses himself over on the bed. SpongeBob puts his leg down, which makes a loud noise] Patrick: Duh... who's there? [mumbles then goes back to sleep.] SpongeBob: [talking to his foot] Shhh! [steps on a potato chip and makes a broken glass sound] Patrick: Eh?! [gibberish] Who's that?! [Patrick is back asleep. SpongeBob sweeps his sweat drops off him and they land, causing a loud splash sound.] Mmm... water. [licks his mouth dry, then tosses himself on the bed. SpongeBob takes another step and makes an \"Aooowga!\" noise. He then steps again, making a loud machine gun noise. Steps again, making the sound of an elephant. He then stretches his leg near the side of the bed, which sounds like a speeding car, then takes the step, making the noise of a car crash. He then peeks above Patrick to see the box. He gets ready to reach for the box, but Patrick takes the box before SpongeBob could grab it. He then slides onto Patrick, grabbing the box] Good old secret box. Let's see what's inside. [opens SpongeBob's mouth and pulls out his tongue, then laughs and lets go of his tongue] Nighty-night, boxie. [puts SpongeBob on the side of the bed. SpongeBob gets off the bed and then trips on a shoestring, causing him to bounce around Patrick's house, making a lot of loud noises until his head hits the wall, causing the portrait to fall off the wall, hitting him in the head, breaking the portrait in half. The box then lands on SpongeBob and makes a loud noise. The scene cuts back to Patrick, who, despite all the noise, continues to sleep] SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper. [Patrick wakes up] Patrick: Huh? Who said that?! Who's there?! SpongeBob: Uh\u2026 Patrick: It's the Clam Burglar! And he's stealing my secret box! [runs up to SpongeBob] Hand over the goods, Secret Box Bandit, and prepare for the most unpleasant pillow fight of your life! [readies his pillow like a shotgun, ready to attack him] SpongeBob: Wait, wait, wait, Patrick! Stop! [takes off his mask] It's me, SpongeBob! Patrick: [stares at him while clueless] Nice try, burglar, but SpongeBob's my best friend, and he'd never steal from me. SpongeBob: No, really, Patrick! Look! [Patrick gasps. SpongeBob presses a button on the ring] SpongeBob and Patrick BFF Ring: It's the Best Friends Forever, Best Friends Forever Ring! Patrick: Our friendship ring! It is you! [crying as he covers his face with his pillow] How could you do this?! SpongeBob: If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside. [throws the pillow away and snatches the box out of SpongeBob's hands] Patrick: [with a tear coming out of his eye] That's it, SpongeBob! You have crossed the line. As of right now, this friendship is over! SpongeBob: [gasps and tears up] Really? Patrick: Nah, you can look inside it if you really want to. SpongeBob: Okay! Oh, this is one of the most exciting moments of my life! Well, here it goes! [he lifts the lid off the box] Huh? Patrick: Well, didn't I tell ya? [we see a string inside the box] Isn't it great? SpongeBob: It's just a string. Patrick: A secret string! SpongeBob: Boy, when you're right, you're right! That's some secret box you've got there! Yeah! Thanks for showing me that! [puts the lid back on the box] Well, good night, Patrick. See you tomorrow! Patrick: Good night, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob pops out of Patrick's house] SpongeBob: I should've known! It was just a piece of string all along! [laughs] Wait 'till I tell Gary! Patrick: [laughs menacingly] Good thing he didn't pull the secret string, opening the... [a secret compartment opens] ...secret compartment of my secret box... [takes out a photo] ...revealing one embarrassing snapshot of SpongeBob at that Christmas Party! [cut to the Bikini Atoll] Merry Christmas, SpongeBob! [laughs as the screen fades to black, ending the episode]"

  "synopsis": [
   "After Mr. Krabs sees a child throwing a coin down a well, much to his horror, he learns about wishing wells and creates the Eugene Krabs Memorial Wishing Well in the hope of making money from it, starting the episode. SpongeBob and Squidward are tasked with digging the well, and SpongeBob does all the work, singing a song about the well's magic while doing so, as to Squidward, who is continuously complaining about the wishing well and its location. After the well's completion, SpongeBob obtains a \"promotion\" in which he has to stay in the bottom of the well all day and night to collect coins that are tossed in.After Sandy, Plankton, and Mrs. Puff throw coins into the well and make their wishes, Patrick arrives and throws his soda cup into the well, thinking it was a trash can. SpongeBob tries to explain to him that it is a wishing well, and Patrick mistakes the voice as coming from the \"trash can.\" He wishes that SpongeBob was here to see the magic trash can with him, and when he tries to throw his coin into the well, he falls inside and meets SpongeBob at the bottom. That night, Mr. Krabs arrives to collect the money, and SpongeBob asks him if any of the wishes have come true yet. Mr. Krabs falsely says that if they \"believe hard enough\" and \"dig deep enough,\" the wishes will come true.The two buddies take this literally and begin to dig the well deeper while singing a song. Eventually, SpongeBob finds a glowing crack on the ground and claims that he has \"found the magic.\" Squidward later comes to the well to tell them how good it feels that they are not able to bother him. SpongeBob tells him that they found the magic, and Squidward, laughing at them, explains that there is no magic and that wishing wells are nothing more than a scam. SpongeBob wishes that he could see the magic for himself, and Squidward falls into the well. SpongeBob and Patrick's antics continue to torment him as he desperately tries to escape. Then he and Patrick get into a fight as a result of Patrick arguing with and believing Squidward is saying he is afraid of Santa Claus when he said he was claustrophobic, which really means a fear of confined places. SpongeBob tried to break the fight up by telling them that the wishing well is a magical place, but to no avail. The next day, Mr. Krabs arrives to check on the well as Squidward finally climbs out, with SpongeBob and Patrick following.Squidward wishes to get as far away from the well as possible, and is subsequently hit by and stuck to the front of a bus going to \"far away\", which gives him everything his karma owes him. Mr. Krabs asks SpongeBob how much money they made, and SpongeBob explains that they made no money, but found the magic. Mr. Krabs then tries to explain to him that there is no such thing as magic, but then sees that the wishes of Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Plankton have all come true. SpongeBob asks if the sights were proof enough, but the skeptical Mr. Krabs still refuses to believe in magic, and tries to prove that it does not exist by wishing to be \"steamed and served with a side of melted butter.\" SpongeBob becomes worried for his boss, before Mr. Krabs gloats and asks where his magic is before he suddenly disappears.Mr. Krabs' wish has been granted and he is turned into a real sea crab on a plate. He wonders where he is, while the hand of a waiter places a cup of melted butter on the plate with him, and he begins to get worried. Then a live-action human puts on a bib that reads \"THE END\" and prepares to eat Mr. Krabs in his meal as he finally realizes that magic is real, confessing that he does believe in it before getting eaten as the episode concludes."

   "Mr. Krabs: [walks up to a pay phone to check if there is any money in it, but there is none] Nothing. Oh well. [hears something in the distance] That sounds like a quarter crying for help. [a quarter rolls in front of Mr. Krabs] Come to papa! Martha Smith: Hold it right there, buddy! My son just dropped that quarter. Mr. Krabs: Yeah? Well that kid looks pretty shifty to me. How do I know he didn't steal it? [Martha hits Mr. Krabs in the face with her purse] Hey! That little brat is throwing perfectly good money away! Oh, so if I can't have it, no one... [gets hit in the face with the purse again] I hope he throws all your retirement money down a hole! [walks over to the well] Poor little quarter. What the...? This well is full of money! Don't worry little fellas, I'll save you! [tries to climb in the well but is too big] Oh, it's no use. Me poop deck's too big. Gale: Make a wish, dear. Harold: All my wishes have already come true. Gale: Oh you. [tosses the coin at the well] Mr. Krabs: No! [jumps at the coin] I'll save ya, money! [grabs the coin] Gotcha. What do you heartless brutes think you're doing? Harold: Umm, using the wishing well. Gale: You toss in a coin and make a wish. Mr. Krabs: And then what? Harold: And... that's it. Nothing else happens. Gale: It's fun! Mr. Krabs: You mean suckers throw in money down a hole for fun? That's the greatest scam ever. Harold: Can we have our quarter back now? [scene cuts to Krusty Krab] Squidward: SpongeBob, why aren't those patties ready? SpongeBob: You can't rush perfection. Squidward: I'm not rushing perfection. I'm rushing you. SpongeBob: [laughs] Always the kidder, Squidward. Squidward: Oh, this job stinks! But at least I'm not digging ditches. Mr. Krabs: [enters the Krusty Krab] Squidward, SpongeBob, I got a new job for ya. [scene cuts to outside Krusty Krab where there is a red X on the ground] X marks the spot of the Eugene Krabs Memorial Wishing Well. SpongeBob: A wishing well, here? Wow! Squidward: Don't you have to be dead to have a memorial anything? Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, don't you believe in magic? [walks off] SpongeBob: Yeah, Squidward, don't you believe in magic? Squidward: No, I don't, and neither does Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob: Well, I do. This well's gonna make a lot of dreams come true. [starts digging] What's the first thing you're gonna wish for? Squidward: To be far away from you as possible. C'mon, SpongeBob, this hole's not gonna dig itself. And I'm certainly not gonna do it. SpongeBob: Squidward, aren't you excited? This is really gonna help people. \u266aTake a penny and some magic, even though your life is tragic...\u266a Squidward: Hey! SpongeBob: \u266a...you can throw all your dreams down the well. Although everyday the pain grows you'll ride unicorns on rainbows, if you throw all your dreams down the well. When your life's come apart at the seams that you've given up all your dreams, here is just the means to make those dreams come true. No more suffering, no more sighin', no more pain and no more cryin'.\u266a Squidward: I'm not cryin'! [SpongeBob hits him with the wand] Ow. Ow. SpongeBob: \u266aWhen you throw all your dreams down the well.\u266a [puts an \"open\" sign in front of the well] Well, Squidward, what do you think? Squidward: That was the worst song I ever heard. But at least this stupid well's finished. Mr. Krabs: It's beautiful. [takes a whiff of the air] You smell that, boys? That's the smell of money. SpongeBob: You mean magic, don't ya? Squidward: All I can smell is that dumpster. [scene pans over to a dumpster behind Squidward] Mr. Krabs: All right, Squidward, you can go back to the register. Squidward: As long as there's no singing. SpongeBob: And I've got a date with a Krabby Patty. Mr. Krabs: Hold on there, SpongeBob. Let me show you your new station. It's kind of a promotion. Sorta. SpongeBob: A promotion? [scene cuts to SpongeBob being lowered in the well by a bucket] Why do I have to go down in the well? Mr. Krabs: To collect the money! SpongeBob: How long do I have to stay down here? Mr. Krabs: See ya in 8 hours. SpongeBob: Thanks for the promotion. It sure is dark and scary down here. [a coin hits SpongeBob in the head] Sandy: I sure wish I had a fancy telescope. One that works underwater. That'd make me happier than a junebug at a porch light sale. SpongeBob: Our very first wish! I can't wait till it comes... [another coin hits SpongeBob in the head] Plankton: I have presented you with a monetary offering as custom dictates. My wish, n\u00e9e my command, is to be taller. Just a little? Just big enough to crush my enemies, like the vermin they are! SpongeBob: Gosh... [another coin hits SpongeBob in the head] Ow! Mrs. Puff: I wish I had a snazzy new boat. I wanna be a hot rod mama. [SpongeBob gasps. Patrick walks up to the well drinking a soda and throws it down the well when he is finished] SpongeBob: Hey! Patrick: Oh my gosh. Who said that? SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick: How do you know my name? SpongeBob: Patrick, this is a wishing well. Just throw in a coin and make a wish. Patrick: Okay, magical talking trashcan. [takes out a coin from his pocket] I wish SpongeBob were here to see this. [throws himself and the coin down the well] SpongeBob: Patrick. Patrick: [lands on top of SpongeBob] Hi, SpongeBob! I got my wish. SpongeBob: Patrick, you're supposed to let go of the coin when you throw it. Patrick: But I got my wish. SpongeBob: Well, we've got 6\u00bd hours \u2018til the end of my shift. What do you want to do now? Patrick: [pokes SpongeBob] Tag, you're it. SpongeBob: [pokes Patrick] Tag, you're it. Patrick: [pokes SpongeBob] Tag, you're it. SpongeBob: [pokes Patrick] Tag, you're it. [day turns into night] Patrick: [pokes SpongeBob] Tag, you're it. SpongeBob: [pokes Patrick] Tag, you're it. Patrick: [pokes SpongeBob] Tag, you're it. SpongeBob: [pokes Patrick] Tag, you're it. Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what kind of haul did you get? SpongeBob: I did great, Mr. Krabs. I got a nickel from Sandy, 2 pennies from Mrs. Puff, a penny from Plankton... [Patrick smiles big] ...and a slightly used pair of dentures. Patrick: And I fell on my head. Mr. Krabs: Well, I could probably get a couple of bucks for Patrick. Nah. You better just hand up the money. [sends the bucket down] SpongeBob: This wishing well was a wonderful idea, Mr. Krabs. Has anyone's wish come true, yet? Mr. Krabs: Uhh, not yet. But I'm sure if you believe strong enough, and dug deep enough, everyone's wishes will come true. SpongeBob: Really? Mr. Krabs: Yeah, sure, whatever. SpongeBob: Can we come out now? Mr. Krabs: Goodness, no. You gotta stay down there just in case any late-night wishers come by. I'll be back for ya at dawn. [leaves] SpongeBob: Aww, no one's wishes are coming true. What did we do wrong? I know I believe hard enough. Maybe I just didn't dig deep enough. What do you say, Patrick? Are you ready to dig for some magic? Patrick: Yeah. SpongeBob: \u266aOh, the magic has gone missin' and everyone's still wishin' but their dreams have fallen flat upon the ground. You'll find magic under rubble, so Patrick grab a shovel, and here is where the magic can be found. We're at the bottom of a well but man won't it be swell, when we make everyone's wishes all come true.\u266a [digs a hole and something yellow glows from the hole] Holy mackerel, look Patrick! We've struck magic. Patrick: Is that good? SpongeBob: Next to being the fry cook, it's the most important thing I've ever done. Patrick: It's the only thing I've ever done. Squidward: Having fun down there, SpongeBob? [laughs] Patrick: Hi, Squidward. Squidward: Patrick's down there, too? It just gets better and better. SpongeBob: Do you wanna make a wish? Squidward: [laughs] I got my wish. You two are stuck in a dark hole and away from me. SpongeBob: Guess what, Squidward? We found the magic. Squidward: [laughs] There's no magic, SpongeBob. Wishing wells are just a scam to fool saps like you. [laughs] SpongeBob: No, it's true! We did find the magic. Oh, I wish you could see it. [Squidward laughs so hard he falls down the well landing on SpongeBob and Patrick] Squidward! You decided to join the party. Patrick: Party! Squidward: Let me out of here. SpongeBob: We were just gonna play some party games. Patrick: [pokes Squidward] Tag, you're it. SpongeBob: [pokes Squidward] Tag, you're it. Patrick: [pokes Squidward] Tag, you're it. Squidward: I gotta get out of here. [tries to climb out of the well] SpongeBob and Patrick: Go, Squidward! Go, Squidward! [he falls] Squidward: There's no way to climb out of here. SpongeBob: Maybe if you had more upper arm strength. Patrick: Yeah you should work out more. Squidward: Well why don't I just start right now? After all I got a couple of dumbbells right here. [laughs] Patrick: I don't get it. Squidward: Could you not stand so close? You're making me claustrophobic. Patrick: What does claustrophobic mean? SpongeBob: It means he's afraid of Santa Claus. Squidward: No, it doesn't. Patrick: Ho, ho, ho! [giggles] SpongeBob: Stop it, Patrick, you're scaring him! Patrick: Ho, ho, ho! Squidward: It's not working, Patrick. Patrick: Darn. SpongeBob: Umm, Squidward, you're standing on my foot. Squidward: Oops. Oh, sorry, SpongeBob. Patrick: [holding a plate of ribs at Squidward's elbow] And you got your elbow in my ribs. Squidward: Eww. Patrick! Patrick: [shoves Squidward] And stop stepping in my potato salad. SpongeBob: Hey, hey, hey, guys. Squidward: [shoves Patrick] Stop pushing me, Patrick. Patrick: You mean like this? [shoves Squidward] Squidward: No, like this! [shoves Patrick] SpongeBob: [both Patrick and Squidward are fighting] You shouldn't fight in here. This is a magical place. [scene zooms to outside the well] Squidward: Patrick, get off of me! [scene zooms back into the well where Patrick is sitting on Squidward] I told you I am claustrophobic! Patrick: Nice try, Squidward, but there's no Santa Claus here. Squidward: [yells] Patrick! [scene cuts to daytime where Mr. Krabs returns to the well] Mr. Krabs: Good morning, SpongeBob! Let's see what ya got. [raises the bucket] Oh, it's heavy. Must be a lot of money. [Squidward comes out of the well] Squidward: Free. I'm free! Mr. Krabs: Squidward? What were you doing down there? I didn't approve any overtime. Or were you sneaking here in the dead of night for free wishes? Squidward: The only thing I wish for is to be far away from here. [gets hit by a bus that is traveling to 'very very far away'] Ow. SpongeBob: Bye Squidward. Enjoy your trip! Patrick: [pulls a long face] Lucky. [walks off] Mr. Krabs: So how much money did you make last night? SpongeBob: We didn't get any money. But we found something better. We found the magic. Mr. Krabs: The what? SpongeBob: We dug down deeper in the well and found the magic. Now all the wishes will come true! Mr. Krabs: Listen closely, SpongeBob. You don't get what you want in life just by wishing for it. [a big telescope with an eye looking out of it appears. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob scream] What in the deep blue is that? Sandy: There's a full moon out tonight. Do you like my new telescope I wished for? SpongeBob: That's great, Sandy! Sandy: That wishing well sure does work. Mr. Krabs: Just a coincidence. [Mrs. Puff drives up in a new boat] Mrs. Puff: What do you think of my new hot rod? SpongeBob: It's beautiful Mrs. Puff. How's about letting me take it for a spin? [both laugh] Mrs. Puff: No. [drives off] SpongeBob: See, Mr. Krabs? She wished for that boat. Mr. Krabs: You mean she stole that boat. Plankton: [walks up gigantically tall] Morning, SpongeBob, Krabs. Beautiful day. [laughs evilly and runs over to the buildings and knocks them over] SpongeBob: Is that proof enough for ya? Mr. Krabs: You'll never get me to believe in magic, never! Just to prove it to ya. [walks over to the well] I'll demonstrate. I wish... I was steamed and served with a side of melted butter. [lets go of the penny and laughs] SpongeBob: [frantically grabs him] Mr. Krabs! No! Mr. Krabs: Well, where's your magic now? [He suddenly vanishes in thin air, to SpongeBob's surprise, then appears as a real crab on a plate and becomes food.] Oh... where am I? [person puts melted butter next to him] What's going on here? [person sits down and puts on an eating bib that says \"THE END\" on it] Uh-oh. I do believe in magic! I do believe in magic! I do believe in magic! Oh no! [The episode irises out with a chomping sound, meaning Mr. Krabs just got eaten alive]"

  "synopsis": [
   "One night, SpongeBob and Gary watch a scary movie called Night of the Robot, which involves robots taking over the world. Gary tells SpongeBob that he should not watch it, as scary movies freak him out, but SpongeBob denies this. However, he later shakes in fear in bed, wondering if everyone he knows is a robot. After asking Gary if he is a robot, SpongeBob decides he has nothing to worry about and tries to get some sleep, but he has a nightmare about the same robot from the movie chasing him.The next day at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob has become very paranoid and believes that robots are \"everywhere\" with every sound jumpscaring him. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is in his office, listening to \"Electric Zoo\" on his portable radio. Mr. Krabs likes the song and hums to it. SpongeBob later walks past Mr. Krabs' office and overhears him saying he feels \"completely recharged.\" He then witnesses Mr. Krabs talking to his radio, talking in a \"robot\" language over the phone, and doing a bizarre robot-like dance to the song.This convinces SpongeBob to believe that Mr. Krabs is a robot imposter, and he relays this information to Squidward. Squidward does not believe him, so SpongeBob tries several tests to prove that Mr. Krabs is a robot. First, he tests Mr. Krabs' sense of humor by having Squidward tell a joke, but Mr. Krabs does not laugh. SpongeBob says that this is because he is a robot, as robots do not laugh, but Squidward says that \"he's obviously heard it before.\"SpongeBob then tests Mr. Krabs' emotions by telling him that Squidward's father never hugged him to see if he will cry. Mr. Krabs says that although it is a little sad, Squidward can hug himself during his break. This further worries SpongeBob, but Squidward says that this is ridiculous and that his father loved him very much. This reminds SpongeBob of the third and final test: the love test. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that Squidward loves him, but he simply tells him to get back to work. Back in his office, Mr. Krabs' radio breaks and he decides to give the batteries to Pearl for her Christmas present. A timer rings, and he grabs a pair of tongs and removes his hard-boiled egg from a pot of boiling water, ready to eat it. But just when Mr. Krabs is about to put some salt on the egg, he is startled when SpongeBob calls out his name a fourth time, and he accidentally tosses the full saltshaker into his eyes, causing him to scream in pain.Squidward then asks SpongeBob what the robots in the movie looked like. SpongeBob says that they had red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and ran on batteries. Squidward then asks if Mr. Krabs looks anything like that, and this is (seemingly) answered when Mr. Krabs barges out of his office screaming in pain with glowing bloodshot eyes, the tongs he used to hold the egg, and the radio batteries in his pocket. As Mr. Krabs runs to the bathroom, Squidward finally believes SpongeBob, and tells him to call the Navy, but due to their automated phone service, SpongeBob thinks that the robots have taken over the Navy. Squidward then announces over the microphone that robots are taking over the world, causing all the customers to flee the Krusty Krab.Mr. Krabs then emerges from the bathroom, relieved that his eyes are not hurting anymore, and goes back to his office, not noticing that the Krusty Krab is now empty. Squidward then wonders how they will find out what happened to the \"real\" Mr. Krabs, and SpongeBob says that the main character in the movie teamed up with a buddy and they got the poop on, or collected information from, the robot. After reading a book on How to Torture, the two go into Mr. Krabs' office and tie him up, demanding to know where the \"real\" Mr. Krabs is. After getting no answers and Mr. Krabs insisting that he is the real Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob and Squidward decide to interrogate his machines, which include a blender, a toaster, a food processor, and a coffee maker.These, of course, do not give any answers either (due to being inanimate objects), and so, Squidward destroys them with a baseball bat. This greatly upsets Mr. Krabs, as he paid good money for each of them (except for the coffee maker as he claims it was actually a gift), and he finally breaks down crying when SpongeBob brings in his most valuable \"robot\": The cash register. He also mentions laughing with it and loving it, revealing that he is not a robot. Seeing that Mr. Krabs really is telling the truth, Squidward then asks SpongeBob how the movie ended. SpongeBob, while thinking the ending was great, remembers that the ending revealed the robot invasion was just in the characters' imagination and that there were no robots after all.Realizing his mistake, SpongeBob declares that it is time to feed Gary and runs off, leaving Squidward to take the heat from Mr. Krabs for pointlessly destroying the machines. As a nervous Squidward grabs a broom and begins sweeping the mess, a furious Mr. Krabs growls and screams \"Squidward!\" as the episode ends."

   "[At night, SpongeBob is watching a movie at his house while eating popcorn.] TV narrator: We now return to tonight's Creepy Time Theater presentation of Night of the Robot . Man on TV: [screaming while being chased by a giant robot] SpongeBob: Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on. Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out. [scene cuts to SpongeBob lying in his bed, whimpering and shivering] What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary? [Gary is sleeping] Psst, Gary? Gare-Bear? [pokes Gary's eye, causing him to wake up] Gary: Meow! SpongeBob: Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right? Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep. [goes to sleep, and dreams about running from the giant robot from the movie earlier] [The scene cuts to the next day at the Krusty Krab, with SpongeBob in the kitchen, panting.] SpongeBob: [looks to his left] Robot! Oh my gosh! [robot turns out to be a sack of potatoes, a dust pan and broom, and a bucket] Huh? [chuckles nervously] [The scene cuts to Mr. Krabs holding down his money on his office desk.] Mr. Krabs: How about a little music to count me money to? [turns on the radio that is next to him] Radio DJ: [from the radio] And now for the number-one song in Bikini Bottom: \"Electric Zoo.\" [Techno beat plays from the radio. Mr. Krabs starts counting his money.] Mr. Krabs: Hey, that's pretty catchy. Bee-bee-boo-bop, bee-bee-boo-beep. Yeah, that's not bad. I love this young people's music. [The scene cuts to the kitchen. A buzzer on the fryer goes off.] SpongeBob: I surrender! Oh. Squidward: SpongeBob! [SpongeBob immediately screams. His hat flies onto Squidward's nose.] SpongeBob: Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose? Squidward: [removes the hat from his nose and puts it back on SpongeBob's head] I'm not wearing your hat on my nose; I'm waiting for Number 17's order! SpongeBob: Number 17... [holds up a tray with food] Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh? Squidward: [sarcastically] Hilarious. Just deliver the food. SpongeBob: [delivers the food to Incidental 64] There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you? Thaddeus: No, I'm not. SpongeBob: Well, keep your eyes peeled. [in a deep voice] They're everywhere. [back to normal voice] Back to work! [runs away, Incidental 64 shrugs his shoulders. SpongeBob walks by Mr. Krabs' office] Mr. Krabs: [from office] I feel completely recharged! SpongeBob: That sounds like Mr. Krabs. [peeks in the window] Mr. Krabs: Come on, little buddy, play it again. [shakes his radio] Please? One more time, for me. SpongeBob: That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels \"recharged.\" [laughs] If I didn't know better, I'd say he was... [scene zooms in on SpongeBob] ...a robot! Nah. Mr. Krabs: [calls the radio station] Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could play that song again. Radio DJ: [from the phone] Hmmm... which one, man? Mr. Krabs: The one that goes \"bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep.\" Radio DJ: No, man. You're thinking of \"bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-bop.\" Mr. Krabs: Bee-boo-boo-boo-boo-bop, [garbled telephone noise] bee-boo-boo-bop, [garbled telephone noise] boo-boo-bee-bop? [garbled telephone noise] Not bee-boo-boo-beep? [garbled telephone noise] Bop? [garbled telephone noise] Beep?! [garbled telephone noise] Boo-boo-bop?! [SpongeBob screams.] SpongeBob: Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's... [scene zooms in on him] ...a robot? Nah. [peeks into the window again and gasps] [Mr. Krabs does a robot dance on his desk as the radio plays the techno music.] SpongeBob: [jumps onto Squidward's arms] Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot! Squidward: [picks up SpongeBob off his arms] That's great, SpongeBob. Why don't you work on this problem back in the kitchen?! [throws him in the kitchen. Squidward laughs, but SpongeBob reappears beside him. Squidward is confused and looks around for how he did it] SpongeBob: I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too. Squidward: [confused] How did you...? SpongeBob: Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter] What is it, boy? SpongeBob: Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it. Mr. Krabs: Is it true, Squidward? Is it hilarious? Squidward: Umm... yeah, sure. Mr. Krabs: Well, let's hear it, lad. SpongeBob: Okay, here it goes! Uh, how'd it go Squidward? Squidward: [chuckles nervously] It went, um, uh, let's see, uh... why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie? Mr. Krabs: Why? Squidward: It was rated... [winks] ...\"Arr!\" [rimshot] [laughing] Arr! Because it's... about... pirates. Mr. Krabs: I'm not paying you to do stand-up, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work! [leaves] SpongeBob: [gasps] Not even a chuckle! See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's... [the scene zooms in on him] ...a robot! Squidward: There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob. He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie. Now why don't you... SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter again] What? What is it, boy? SpongeBob: Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad? [pretends to cry] Mr. Krabs: Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break! Now get back to work! [leaves again] SpongeBob: Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either. Squidward: SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much! SpongeBob: That's the final test, Squidward; the love test. Robots can't love. Squidward: No, wait, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter again] What is it, SpongeBob?! SpongeBob: I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you! [Mr. Krabs makes a blank expression on his face.] Mr. Krabs: Get back to work, Mr. Squidward. SpongeBob: [gulps] Squidward? [Mr. Krabs is at his desk writing something. Suddenly, the radio slows down and stops working. The radio breaks with black smoke and electronic breakage sound effect.] Mr. Krabs: Aw, me radio died! [takes out the batteries] Hmm, these batteries still have a little juice in 'em. I know! I'll give 'em to Pearl for Christmas. [puts the batteries in his back pocket. A bell rings and then Mr. Krabs walks over to a pot of boiling water] Me hard-boiled egg is ready! [picks up a pair of tongs] I can already taste it. Come to Papa. [takes the egg out of the water with his tongs] Got ya! And what good is a hot-boiled egg without a little salt? [picks up a salt shaker] SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs: [breaks the egg and accidentally tosses the full salt shaker into his eyes, then proceeds to scream in pain] Oh, my eyes! [continues screaming] SpongeBob: Mr-- [Squidward puts his hand over SpongeBob's mouth] Squidward: Will you be quiet? Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like? SpongeBob: Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries. Squidward: Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?! [Mr. Krabs barges out of his office, still screaming. He now has burning red eyes, the pair of tongs snipping in his claw, and the batteries in his pocket, just like the robot in the movie.] SpongeBob and Squidward: [both scream] Mr. Krabs: [continues screaming as he goes into the bathroom] Squidward: I'll evacuate the customers, you call the navy! SpongeBob: [runs over to the phone] Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy! Operator: Hello, you've reached the Navy's automated phone service. SpongeBob: Squidward, the robots are running the Navy! Squidward: Not the Navy! [over loudspeaker] Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world! [everyone is silent] Our world! [there's another brief moment of silence, then all the customers run out screaming] What do we do now? SpongeBob: I don't know! [notices a nickel] Hey, a nickel! [points at it] Squidward: SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Sorry. Mr. Krabs: [walks out of the bathroom, his eyes back to normal] Ah, that's better. [walks back to his office] Bee-boo-boo-boo-bee-bop, boo-boo-bop. Squidward: We need to find out what that robot did with the real Mr. Krabs, but how? SpongeBob: Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot. Squidward: They poop on the robot? SpongeBob: Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information. Squidward: I never thought I'd say this, but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop! [Squidward grabs the book titled \"How to Torture\" and reads it with SpongeBob. SpongeBob grabs some rope while Squidward grabs a hammer and a saw. SpongeBob also grabs some old comedy records. The scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' office, where SpongeBob and Squidward enter.] Mr. Krabs: Oh, hello, boys. [they are at the door with angry expressions on their faces] What can I do for you? [SpongeBob and Squidward lock the door] Heh-heh, why did you lock the door? [nervously as they slowly and menacingly approach him, camera shakingly zooms towards Mr. Krabs] Why do you have that rope? Who's watching the cash register?! [shot of outside the Krusty Krab where loud crashing and everyone screaming can be heard] Get your hands off me! [back in the office, Squidward ties Mr. Krabs to his office chair] SpongeBob! Squidward! What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant! Squidward: Shut up! [slaps Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs: Sweet Davy Jones, what the heck is going on?! Squidward: I said [slaps Mr. Krabs again] \"shut up,\" you bucket of bolts! SpongeBob: I can't take it! [runs off, crying] Squidward: SpongeBob, are you okay? SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch! Squidward: No, that's not Mr. Krabs. [shows that Mr. Krabs is trying to get out of his chair] That's Robot Krabs. SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Squidward: And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know. SpongeBob: Right. [runs up to Mr. Krabs and then slaps him] Squidward: SpongeBob, you gotta ask him a question first. SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear? [slaps him again] Squidward: SpongeBob, let me handle this. [turns a light on Mr. Krabs] Where's Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs: [confused] What are you talking about? I'm Mr. Krabs. [Squidward slaps him yet again] Squidward: We can do this all night if you want. Where's Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs! SpongeBob: Where's Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs! Squidward: Where's Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs: I am Mr. Krabs! I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am! SpongeBob: This is one stubborn robot. Mr. Krabs: [confused, then angrily yells] What?! [his yelling knocks over the lamp and SpongeBob] You think I'm a robot?! Squidward: We don't think; we know. Mr. Krabs: That's the silliest thing I ever heard! I am Mr. Krabs! Squidward: [walks over to SpongeBob] He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way. SpongeBob: I got an idea. [pokes Squidward's nose] Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robo-tricks. [runs out and returns later] If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will. [holds up a blender] Squidward: SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender. SpongeBob: Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his \"little buddy.\" Squidward: Oh, really? Put it on the table, SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs: You're gonna interrogate my blender? You're crazy. Squidward: We're just gonna see what your \"little buddy\" knows. [SpongeBob sets the blender on Mr. Krabs' desk. Squidward holds up a bat] Mr. Krabs: [panicking] No, wait! What are you gonna do to me blender?! That cost me money! Squidward: Where's Mr. Krabs? [shot of the blender] Not talkin', eh? [breaks the blender with the bat] Mr. Krabs: No! That cost me $24.95! SpongeBob: I guess it didn't know anything. Squidward: Go get the toaster. [SpongeBob gets the toaster then puts it on Mr. Krabs' desk] Mr. Krabs: No, not me toaster. That cost me $32.50! [Squidward breaks the toaster and then SpongeBob sets a food processor on the desk.] Mr. Krabs: $62.67! [Squidward breaks the food processor with the bat. SpongeBob picks up a coffee maker and puts it on the desk.] Mr. Krabs: [thinks a minute before replying] Four... well, actually, that one was a gift. [Squidward breaks the coffee maker, which causes Mr. Krabs to scream.] Mr. Krabs: No...! SpongeBob: [while trying to put the cash register on Mr. Krabs' desk] This is the last robot, Squidward! Mr. Krabs: No! Not my cash register! I raised it myself! I got it when it was just a little calculator! [crying] No! [sobbing and then sobbing louder] Squidward: I thought you said robots can't cry. SpongeBob: I also said they couldn't love. Mr. Krabs: [crying] I loved it like it was me own. SpongeBob: Uh, at least he's not laughing. Mr. Krabs: Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share! [crying] Squidward: SpongeBob, uh... how did that movie of yours end? SpongeBob: The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their... [slows down, as he realizes his mistake] imagination. [chuckles nervously, timpani noise, as if he anticipates Squidward to be angry at him, then checks his watch] Hey, it's time to feed Gary. [quickly runs off back home] [Squidward smiles nervously at Mr. Krabs and then grabs a broom and sweeps the broken pieces on the floor. Mr. Krabs becomes infuriated. The scene later exits from the office to the exterior of The Krusty Krab outside.] Mr. Krabs: [growls in fury, starting the background shaking] Squidward!"
