  "synopsis": [
   "The episode opens on another day at the Krusty Krab, with Mr. Krabs manning a free salad bar, SpongeBob preoccupied with cleaning rogue dust particles off a table, and Squidward daydreaming about dancing. Mr. Krabs is getting irritated at the lack of customers when one decides to come in. Ecstatic at finally getting a customer, Mr. Krabs orders SpongeBob to cater to the fish's every whim. Unfortunately for them, the fish was only looking to get change for a dollar and is driven away by SpongeBob's excessive enthusiasm, though not before leaving a penny behind for SpongeBob. However, Mr. Krabs notices the penny and literally gets the drop on it first.As Mr. Krabs stores the penny away in his vault, he gives his two employees the bad news: Profits are way down this month, and they need a gimmick to bring in customers. His request for ideas yields a response of apathy from Squidward and increasingly absurd ideas from SpongeBob. After Mr. Krabs points out that he was thinking along the lines of \"live entertainment,\" Squidward hits a brainstorm: the first Krusty Krab talent show, which he would host.He nearly blurts out his intent to make himself into a star, but quickly corrects his faux-pas by claiming it would \"bring culture to this cultural wasteland we call Bikini Bottom,\" and that it would bring in much-needed revenue. Squidward draws in Mr. Krabs further by claiming that Pearl could become a star through this. SpongeBob is excited at the chance to show off his talents and runs off to call his parents, while Mr. Krabs gives Squidward approval to organize the show. As preparations are undertaken at the Krusty Krab for the upcoming show, SpongeBob asks Squidward when he is going to go on the show, even demonstrating his act, which consists of blowing a hippopotamus-shaped bubble, then tap dancing along with it. Unfortunately, the talent does not impress Squidward, who claims it is not \"cultured\" enough. SpongeBob runs off, vowing to come up with the most \"cultural\" performance ever.Later that evening, the Krusty Krab is packed; among the audience are Patrick and SpongeBob's parents, the latter of whom Mr. Krabs personally introduces himself and nonchalantly admits his miserliness. Backstage, Squidward makes it very clear to everyone else that this is his own chance to reach stardom but is interrupted by SpongeBob's newest act: inflating himself with water and showing off his spongy characteristics. Squidward once again shoots him down, not wanting SpongeBob to ruin his chances at stardom. SpongeBob tearfully begs Squidward to let him on the show, claiming he will do anything, with the cephalopod assigning him to clean up after the show is done. SpongeBob, not realizing that Squidward has assigned him custodial duties, endeavors on his new \"act\" with great enthusiasm.Squidward goes on stage to introduce the audience to the first Krusty Krab Talent Show, in the process making a joke about how no one else would give the Krabby Patty a home. This greatly amuses Patrick to the point where he randomly interrupts the next parts of Squidward's speech with loud guffawing. Not able to get in a word edgewise, Squidward eventually just introduces Pearl by her name alone and leaves the stage. Pearl is unveiled with a set of cheerleader pom-poms, and Mr. Krabs is ecstatic to see his daughter in the spotlight. Her act is a cheerleading routine about the Krusty Krab, but her size and weight launch the entire audience up into the air with each jump, resulting in everyone eventually lying about in various states of pain. As she leaves the stage, SpongeBob drops into badger Squidward about his next \"act,\" asking which direction he should mop the floor, with the latter trying to ignore him.The next act is poetry by SpongeBob's pet snail, Gary. While the pet \"speaks\" in meows, no one, except for Sandy Cheeks, can understand how good his poetry is. Squidward is increasingly anxious at this point, both from how much time Gary is wasting with his act and from SpongeBob bothering him again. The third act is by Mr. Krabs' business rival Plankton as \"The Amazing Plankton,\" with him intending to make a Krabby Patty \"disappear\" before the audience's eyes. However, it is just another ploy to steal the Krabby Patty formula, one that Mr. Krabs puts a stop to. Plankton, vowing revenge, attempts to vanish into thin air with a magic spell, but only blows himself up and leaves the restaurant in shame as the crowd boos him.The crowd by this point is getting fed up with the terrible acts, and Mr. Krabs storms backstage, angry at the lack of good responses. Squidward temporarily placates him by claiming he \"saved the best for last.\" After many talent performers, Squidward appears with his dancing gear, wearing a blue leotard, to looks of confusion from the audience.Squidward starts out dancing to orchestral music before the music suddenly changes into a trance-like techno beat; Squidward's dancing also becomes incredibly bizarre. His talent act comes to halt when the audience members, completely disgusted by his talent, or lack thereof, erupt into boos and pelt him with tomatoes from the free salad bar. Mr. Krabs, hoping to cash in on the audience's rage, quickly slaps a one-dollar price tag on the front of the free salad bar, which one audience member admits is \"worth every penny\" because they all hate Squidward's act more than all of the other acts put together. An infuriated Squidward defensively criticizes the audience for having no appreciation for his talent, only to be coldly rebuffed as the equally enraged crowd chants, \"No talent!\" repeatedly. Furious, he storms backstage, where a waiting SpongeBob asks whether he can go on now. Squidward permits him to do so, as the show is over, much to the sponge's confusion.SpongeBob gets to work cleaning the stage, only to receive an unexpected surprise: the audience not only interprets the cleaning as an act but appreciates it. Squidward thinks the audience has changed their mind about him and charges in as SpongeBob leaves, only to be met with silence. He storms off again, and SpongeBob continues cleaning to great applause. Squidward charges in and is once again met by silence. However, he begins to realize that SpongeBob seems to be tied to the audience's sudden change in behavior and tries several times to get the audience to cheer for him by doing SpongeBob's act, only to be rejected and have another tomato thrown at him. Squidward is forced to conclude that it is SpongeBob the audience is cheering for and watches from the sidelines. Squidward gets praised by Mr. Krabs for organizing the event, and SpongeBob's parents for making their son a star. Mr. Krabs, lying in a wheelbarrow full of money, says he will need another one for next week's show; Squidward can only sigh and watch with sad envy as SpongeBob gets a standing ovation for his cleaning, ending the episode."

   "[The episode begins with an exterior shot of the Krusty Krab. There are no customers inside. Mr. Krabs is standing next to the 'FREE' salad bar. Squidward is reading a \"Dance Now!\" ballet magazine and imagining his head on the dancers. SpongeBob is wiping dust off tables.] [Back to Mr. Krabs still standing next to the 'FREE' salad bar, attempting to retain his smile. A piece of paper flies through the entrance of the Krusty Krab.] Mr. Krabs: Hmm... I just don't get it. [holds the 'FREE' sign] If a free salad bar doesn't bring in customers, what will?! [Squidward is dancing] Squidward! Squidward: Uh-uh... Yes, sir? Mr. Krabs: There's gonna be some changes around here. [Incidental 4 walks in. Mr. Krabs gasps] A customer! Welcome to the Krusty Krab! [runs up to Incidental 4 with a chair and seats him. Brings him back to the table] SpongeBob, cater to his every whim. And don't screw this one up. SpongeBob: [with a pencil on his side, saluting] Aye, aye, sir! Welcome aboard, sir! Here at the Krusty Krab, [points at Incidental 4] you are the captain, and I am your cabin boy. You just say the word and I will throw myself in the brig! May I take your order? Incidental 4: All I wanted was change for the payphone. [shows the dollar] SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir! [runs off quickly and comes back with change. Talking in a French accent] Monsieur's ch\u00e1ng\u00e9. [snaps his fingers] Incidental 4: Thanks. [laughs nervously and leaves a penny on the table] Here you go. [runs off as Mr. Krabs smells the penny] Mr. Krabs: [his eyes and the background turn into money] Yah! [jumps on the penny while destroying the table] [Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs putting the penny away in his safe in his office.] Mr. Krabs: [talking to Squidward and SpongeBob] Now as you may have noticed, profits are way down this month. [pulls down a chart with red zig-zag lines going down and his eyes sticking out on each side] We've got to think of a gimmick to bring in customers. [pulls the chart up] Do you lubbers have any ideas? SpongeBob: I've got one! [takes out a tray with a soda and a pair of socks on it] A free pair of socks with every purchase! Squidward: Ahem. [continues reading the \"Dance Now!\" ballet magazine] SpongeBob: [off-screen] Or maybe 'Double Patty Midnight Madness'! [cut back to him tossing out the tray] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I know! I know! I know! How about 'mouth full of clams' day! Everyone who shows up with a mouthful of clams... [talks with mouth full of clams] ...gets a free drink! Huh? Huh? Mr. Krabs: Well, uhh, I was thinkin\u2019 more along the lines of live entertainment. Squidward: [gasps] That's it, a floor show! Wait, a talent show! With your host, me! [runs up to Mr. Krabs with stars in his eyes] This is the moment I've... [eyes return to normal] I mean, we've been dreaming of. Think of it, Mr. Krabs, you will be responsible for bringing culture to this cultural wasteland we call Bikini Bottom! And not to mention, the money. Mr. Krabs: The money? [Squidward is lying on the table] Squidward: And I can see it now... your daughter Pearl, her name up in lights. Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs looks at his picture of him and Pearl] Little Pearly... a star? SpongeBob: Hoppin' clams! A talent show! I'm talented! I'd better call my folks! [runs off as Squidward and Mr. Krabs shake hands] Mr. Krabs: Squidward, you've got a deal. Make my little girl a star! [Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab being redecorated for the talent show. Squidward is writing notes on a notepad.] SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, what time am I goin\u2019 on? Squidward: Going on what? SpongeBob: The show! When am I goin\u2019 on the show? I have a great act! Squidward: What talent could you possibly possess? [SpongeBob blows a big bubble which turns into a hippo. Then blows two small bubbles for the hat and cane. Both perform their tap-dancing act.] SpongeBob: Ta-dah! [Squidward yawns] Squidward: No one, not even your parents, would want to see that! [hippo bubble pops] What the people want is culture! Not dancing bubbles! SpongeBob: Okay, I get it! Don't worry, Squidward, I'm going to come up with the most cultured act ever! Squidward: I can hardly wait. [SpongeBob runs off] Phew. The only culture that guy has is in his tennis shoes. [laughs] Tennis shoes. I crack myself up. [Bubble transition to later that night of the talent show where people are outside conducting interviews and people inside are talking and getting set-up. A submarine passes by.] Incidental 95: [talking in the background] We are now at the Krusty Krab Talent Show featuring the finest talent in the town... SpongeBob: [peeks out from behind the curtain] Wow! A full house! [gasps] There's Mom and Dad! They are gonna be so proud! [Mr. Krabs shakes Harold SquarePants' hand] Mr. Krabs: Hello, I'm Mr. Krabs, and I like money. SpongeBob: I gotta get ready! [Squidward gets everyone's attention] Squidward: Alright, listen up, people. Listen up. Gather around everyone, chop, chop. [performers gather around] Now, you may be thinking this is your one shot at the big time. Well, it's not. It's mine . SpongeBob: Hey, Squid! How about this for the show? [runs off and runs back with a tub full of water and the words 'Mister Absorbency' written on the front] The Amazing Mister Absorbency! [puts his finger in the water and absorbs it. Absorbs the water into his legs] Whoa! Ta-dah! [absorbs water into his head] Ta-dah! Squidward: No one is gonna wanna see you engorge yourself. [The water is released from SpongeBob.] SpongeBob: [grabs Squidward's legs] Please, Squidward, let me be in the show! I'll do anything! Anything! Anything! Squidward: So you really wanna be in the show? SpongeBob: Oh, yes! Squidward: Okay, you get to mop up afterwards. [hands SpongeBob a mop] Now will you stop bugging me? [walks off] SpongeBob: [sobbing] So, this is what it feels like... the big time! With this mop, I shape my destiny! [The show starts and crowd applauds. Squidward comes out and gets the cue cards that are in his tuxedo] Squidward: [clears throat] Uh, good evening and...and welcome to the first annual Squidward Tentacles Talent Show. Sponsored by the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty, because no one else would give it a home. [a rimshot plays and Patrick laughs] Uh, thank you, heh. Our next act is living proof that nepotism is alive and well. [another rimshot plays and Patrick laughs again] Patrick: It's happened! [laughing] Squidward: Heh, thank you. Uh, put your fins together for... [Patrick cracks up laughing very hard. Bashes on the table with laughter, shaking dinnerware. He falls off his chair] Put your... [Patrick laughs] Put... [Patrick laughs] Pearl. [crowd applauds] Mr. Krabs: Hooray! [the curtain rises for Pearl, dressed in cheerleader uniform] My little girl is finally a star. Pearl: Give me a K-R-U! [jumps up and down on the stage causing the crowd to fly up and down with her] Give me a S-T-Y! [jumps up and down again] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down] Mr. Krabs: [He, Patrick, and SpongeBob's parents get tossed up and down. Mr. Krabs appears happy.] Now that's what I call talent! [Krusty Krab floor is destroyed] Pearl: Thank you! Fred: My leg! Ugh! Pearl: Thank you, [chuckles] thank you! [Squidward closes the curtain and as he is lowering the rope, SpongeBob is tied to it holding a mop and a bucket of water. Squidward screams in shock.] SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, listen. What do you think? When I mop, should I go forward and back? No, no wait, side to side. [Squidward lets the rope go and sends SpongeBob flying up. Then he walks back out on the stage] Squidward: And now, poetry... [walks backstage but peeks his head through the curtain] by Gary. [The curtain opens. Gary is on a stool] Gary: [clears throat] Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Sandy: [with awe] Oh, he has such a way with words. Gary: Meow. Meow. Meow. Squidward: [checks his watch as Gary continues meowing] Come on, come on, Ginsburg, if he doesn't hurry it up, we're not gonna have enough time for the best act... me! [SpongeBob walks up] SpongeBob: [as the audience applauds] Squidward, should I use Mr. Cleanser or Dr. Clean? Squidward: Yes. [walks away] [Meanwhile, the audience applauds as the curtain opens, revealing Plankton in a magician costume and a sign that says 'The Amazing Plankton!!!'] Plankton: [holding a magic wand] I, the amazing Plankton, with the use of prestidigitation... [turns his wand into flowers] ...will make a Krabby Patty disappear before your very eyes. [throws the flowers aside] First, I'll need a volunteer from the audience. [Plankton jumps onto a table and grabs the Krabby Patty from the Touppe fish. He runs toward the door, but Krabs stops him at the exit.] Mr. Krabs: Nice try. [grabs the patty] Your act's over, bub. Plankton: You may win this time! Shi-ya Ka-zing! [Plankton claps his hands and ignites into a mini-explosion. The smoke from the explosion clears and he is completely charred.] Plankton: Well, this stinks. [looks down at the floor, defeated] [Plankton walks off to the Chum Bucket as the audience boos. Mr. Krabs angerly runs up to Squidward backstage, leaving a trail of flames.] Mr. Krabs: Squidward! [literally races towards him, like an over speeding race car] This show is a disaster! You're ruinin\u2019 me! Squidward: Now, now, don't you worry, Mr. Krabs. I've saved the best for last, you'll see. Mr. Krabs: For your sake, I hope you're right! [The scene changes to the last talent act of the night. A bunch of spotlights gleam around the Krusty Krab.] Squidward: And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for. We've saved the best for last. Put your hands together for... [all streamers, confetti and purple, pink and blue balloons fall everywhere] the incomparable Squidward! [Plays a movie-esque sting as the 'Squidward Live' words blink in pink and green lights as the crowd applauds. The curtain opens and the background shows the Grand Canyon. Squidward proudly enters the scene in a sleeveless leotard. The audience suddenly stops clapping and stares blankly. Squidward dances with birds, accompanied by classical music. Then, the lights go dark and music becomes techno as Squidward dances weirdly. Makes weird noises as he dances after the first part of his dance.] Incidental F4: What the...?! [Squidward continues to make weird noises and dance weirdly. Two fish run over to the salad bar and throw tomatoes at Squidward as the crowd erupts to a chorus of enraged boos.] Mr. Krabs: I'm losin' money on this deal! [puts a $1.00 sticker over the free sign on the salad bar and grins] Fred: [takes out a dollar to Mr. Krabs] It's worth every penny! [pays Mr. Krabs and grabs a tomato] [Everyone in the audience runs up to Mr. Krabs with dollar bills in hand. The crowd continues to boo both angerly and loudly.] Squidward: You bottom feeders! You don't even know talent! Crowd: No talent! No talent! No talent! No talent! [curtain closes as Squidward leaves in extreme frustration and fury] SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, can I go on now? Squidward: Yeah, show's over! [crowd continues to boo and chant \"No talent!\" as SpongeBob walks out and mops up the tomatoes. Crowd gets interested in this and applauds at him] Crowd: Hey, yeah. That's really not bad. I like that! Alright! [SpongeBob briefly stops mopping and the crowd becomes silent. He then starts mopping faster getting even more applause. He then leaves stage right and the applause stops. He peeks from where he left and mops the floor while leaving stage left which starts the applause again. He waves goodbye to the crowd] We want more! We want more! We want more! We want\u2014 Squidward: They want an encore! [pushes SpongeBob away] Stand aside, SpongeBob! [Squidward jumps out and the crowd grows silent. He goes backstage in frustration and SpongeBob comes back out mopping and crowd cheers again. SpongeBob leaves stage left as Squidward jumps out again and the crowd instantly becomes silent again. Squidward is angry.] [Squidward goes backstage and grabs SpongeBob. The crowd cheers again. Then he puts his own head through the curtain and the crowd goes silent.] [SpongeBob's arm gets a cheer, but Squidward's arm does not. SpongeBob's leg is shown then curtain rises and SpongeBob is mopping to the crowd cheering. Curtain closes then opens to reveal Squidward mopping and the crowd goes silent.] [Squidward stops and he is angry. He tries to mop somewhere else to impress them. He then raises his hands up in a ta-da moment, but someone in the crowd throws a tomato and SpongeBob sweeps it up as the crowd cheers. Backstage, Harold and Margaret SquarePants bring Mr. Krabs up in a wheelbarrow full of cash.] Mr. Krabs: [as the crowd chants \"We want more!\"] You did it, Squidward, what a great show! Mrs. Margaret SquarePants: Oh, my son's a star! Mr. Harold SquarePants: Who ever knew he had such talent? Mr. Krabs: I'll be needin\u2019 another wheelbarrow for next week's show! [Squidward moans. The crowd throws flowers at SpongeBob as the episode ends]"

  "synopsis": [
   "A crowd of hungry nematodes arrive in Bikini Bottom early in the morning and eat a variety of items. Upon reaching SpongeBob's house, they pull out straws and start drinking the juice inside it. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Gary are inside, sleeping, as everything starts to shrink. SpongeBob and Gary wake up and rush into the living room as SpongeBob calls Squidward on the phone, and Squidward asks if it is time for SpongeBob to ruin his day. SpongeBob tries to explain the situation only for the phone to shrink as well.Then Patrick gets up asking, \"Is it already time to ruin Squid's day?\" before rushing over elegantly dressed. When Squidward sees that there is nothing left of SpongeBob's house save what seems to be small pebble, he starts elatedly saying goodbye to SpongeBob, but throws a party inside his house, with confetti and streamers flying out of his front windows. Now that the house is no longer there, SpongeBob says that he will have to move back in with his mom and dad. However, Patrick convinces SpongeBob to build a new house.Later, SpongeBob and Patrick attempt to build another pineapple house, but it ends up being a scale model, meaning SpongeBob has no choice but to move away, until Patrick offers to allow SpongeBob and Gary to stay at his house. When SpongeBob and Gary try to sleep, Patrick hogs his rock, which he and SpongeBob are using as a blanket, and they get into a tug-of-war. Not only does Patrick snore so loud that SpongeBob put corks in his ears, but he also begins drooling in his sleep. SpongeBob absorbs the drool and waddles over to Patrick to put a giant cork inside his mouth. Later, Patrick has dreams that spiders are attacking him, and hits SpongeBob repeatedly with the rock, crushing him. SpongeBob decides to sleep far away from Patrick, but when Patrick has another nightmare, he sleep-runs to where SpongeBob is and pounds him with his rock some more before heading back to where he was and going back to sleep the way he normally does.SpongeBob gives up sleeping at Patrick's house and goes to sleep at Squidward's. SpongeBob asks Squidward for a glass of water, and Squidward, who is still half-asleep, brings him one. When they say goodnight to each other, Squidward suddenly wakes up and realizes that SpongeBob is sleeping at his house, and angrily kicks him and Gary out, leaving both of them without a place to stay for the rest of the night.The next morning, Squidward gets up early so he can see SpongeBob move back with his parents. When SpongeBob's parents arrive, Patrick begins crying hysterically and attempts to drag SpongeBob's family's car to a stop while Squidward starts dancing and singing. Despondent, SpongeBob buries the pebble from the beginning of the episode where his house used to be because it holds too many memories. He begins to tear up, and one tear falls on the spot where the pebble was planted. However, the \"pebble\" is actually a seed, and SpongeBob's tear waters the pineapple seed, which causes it to glow and creates a massive vine. This vine sprouts a new pineapple house identical to the previous one, drops it on top of Squidward, and retreats underground. SpongeBob is happy his house came back as he, his parents, and Patrick rush over to go inside to find everything back to where it belongs. Just before the episode closes, SpongeBob then goes over to tell Squidward, who is underneath the floor, that he\u2019s back forever, much to the cephalopod's dismay."

   "[The episode begins with several nematodes jumping.] Nematodes: Walking, walking, walking, walking. [continue to repeat \"walking\"] Nematode #1: Hungry!

Nematodes: Still hungry, still hungry, still hungry, still hungry.

Nematodes: Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty, thirsty. [continue to repeat \"thirsty.\" They all bounce to SpongeBob's house and take out some straws. Then start drinking up the pineapple house. SpongeBob and Gary are still sleeping as various items in the bedroom shrink out of existence, including a treasure chest, Gary's food bowl, and the foghorn alarm clock] Gary: Meow. [the rest of the room begins to shrink as SpongeBob wakes up] SpongeBob: Hooray, Gary! We're finally huge! [the room shrinks again, and the bed disappears, leaving SpongeBob on the floor] Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Huh? Wait a minute. [cut to the outside, where the nematodes are still drinking the pineapple] Oh no! [runs into the living room. He squeezes through the shrinking doorway and gets launched into the wall. Gary also gets stuck in the door as he slithers in] Gary: Meow! SpongeBob: [crashes into the wall, flipping the side table over. The phone lands on his lap] Ow. Shell phone! I know. [while quickly dialing] I'll call Squidward. He'll know what to do. Squidward: [on the other line] Hello? SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward: Is it time already for you to ruin my day? SpongeBob: Squidward! Help me! [SpongeBob's phone starts shrinking as he tries to explain what's going on] My house is shrinking, I woke up this morning and it was getting smaller and [cut back to Squidward in his bed. SpongeBob's voice sounds fast and high-pitched as a result of his phone shrinking] smaller and the walls are closing in on me, Squidward, Gary is terrified too! [SpongeBob's phone disappears, and the phone call is disconnected] [regular-paced normal voice] Oh no! Squidward: Yep, it is. [SpongeBob screams] Patrick: [comes out from his rock] Huh? Is it time already to ruin Squid's day? [peels off his rock and falls on his furniture, then jumps out with a tuxedo and top hat on] Hey, SpongeBob, don't start without me! [The nematodes continue sucking on SpongeBob's house, then they all burp and leave.] SpongeBob: Ohh... nematodes. [sees a seed on the ground, then picks it up] The only thing left of my house is this little pebble. [Patrick and Squidward walk up] Squidward: What's going on here? SpongeBob: I've got bad news, guys! Look at what happened to my house! It's gone! [sadly] It's all gone. What am I going to do? Where am I going to live? Squidward: [smiling] Yeah... Patrick: [his eyes pop-out in surprise] Hey, SpongeBob, your house is gone! Squidward: Well, what can I say? [begins to shake SpongeBob's hand] It's been great knowing you, SpongeBob. Good luck, somewhere else. [walks back to his house as he continues talking sarcastically] I'm gonna miss you. Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo. [party favors fly out Squidward's windows as he celebrates] Boo-hoo! Boo-haha! Boo-hoo! [starts to laugh] Patrick: Squid's taking it real hard. What are you gonna do now? SpongeBob: I guess I'll have to move back with my mom and dad. [cut to a picture of SpongeBob's parents smiling] Patrick: No. Wait a minute, no you don't! [cut back to the picture of SpongeBob's parents, now frowning] We can build you a new house! SpongeBob: We can't build a house! Patrick: Well, sure, it's easy! I built my house all by myself! [the antenna on Patrick's rock falls off] SpongeBob: Alright, Patrick, let's get to work! [Bubble transition to later in the daytime. The screen zooms in on SpongeBob and Patrick as construction workers. SpongeBob holds a screwdriver, while Patrick holds a hammer.] Patrick: [attempts to hit a nail into a board but hits his hand instead] Ow! Ow! Ow! [Meanwhile, SpongeBob takes two buckets of paint, one red and one green. He pours the red paint on his backside and pours the green paint on his front side. He puts one side on a fence so that the paint gets on it, and then he does the other side the same way. He does this twice. As he uses a wrench to tighten a loose bolt, the screen turns every time SpongeBob tightens the bolt sending Patrick sliding, falling upside down towards the sky, then back onto the ground right side up. SpongeBob nails pieces of wooden boards together in midair, and a piece falls off and lands on Patrick's hand, leading him to say \"Ow!\" each time. Patrick moves his board under the next board, which falls down on his hand. This happens several times. The scene later fades in to show SpongeBob's finished house, albeit smaller, shown also with sparkles] Patrick: [gives a big thumbs up with bandages wrapped around his thumb] We're done! SpongeBob: Yeah! So what do you think? Patrick: [SpongeBob's built house sparkles a little] I wish I lived there. SpongeBob: Really? Patrick: No. [SpongeBob puts the small pineapple on his head] SpongeBob: One bedroom. [nose sticks out through the door and the pineapple breaks into pieces] Patrick: Tartar sauce. SpongeBob: [pets Gary] Well, looks like we've got to move back with Mom and Pop! Patrick: Well, you can't move back in with your parents! When my parents kicked me out of the house, I never went back! Wait! You and Gary can come stay with me! SpongeBob: That'd be great! Patrick: Yeah! We'll be rockmates! [Bubble transition to nighttime. SpongeBob and Patrick get ready to sleep under Patrick's rock] Patrick: Good night, SpongeBob. [closes the rock] SpongeBob: Good night, rockmate. Gary: [atop the rock] Meow. SpongeBob: Good night, Gary. [SpongeBob goes to sleep snoring but then is awaken to Patrick's loud snoring] Oh...what the...? [Patrick drools while snoring. Gary hides in his shell shivering while the wind is blowing. SpongeBob puts a cork in each side of his head and goes back to sleep. The wind continues to blow and Patrick shivers; he then pulls the rock closer to him. But SpongeBob shivers in the cold and pulls it back over himself. Gary sits on top of the rock as the two keep pulling it back and forth until Patrick keeps the rock closer to him. SpongeBob gets cold and he covers himself with sand on and goes to sleep. Patrick starts drooling heavily, filling his mouth, and flows like a stream over to SpongeBob. As SpongeBob snores, he absorbs the drool coming from Patrick and becomes a fat sponge. He waddles over to Patrick and removes the corks, spilling Patrick's drool out of him and down-sizing him to normal size. Then he takes out a bigger cork and puts it in Patrick's mouth and goes back to sleep. Patrick struggles to breathe, then spits out the cork.] Patrick: [lifts rock and starts smashing SpongeBob with it in his sleep several times when the spiders don't wanna get them] Oh! Spiders! Spiders! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off! Get 'em off, off me! Off, off, off! [he then goes back to sleep] SpongeBob: No, Patrick! No, Patrick! No, wake up! No, wake up! No, it's me! I'm SpongeBob! [moves out of the rock and away from it a few feet and goes back to sleep but then wakes up] Patrick: Spiders! Spiders! [picks up his rock, runs over to SpongeBob, and smashes him repeatedly with the rock, the spiders can't get him again] Spiders! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! SpongeBob: Ow, ow, ow, oh, oh, ow, ow, ow, ow! [shivers as Patrick goes back to sleep] [The scene cuts to Squidward sleeping in his bedroom. SpongeBob, holding Gary, appears, standing next to Squidward.] SpongeBob: [taps Squidward's nose repeatedly as he whispers] Squidward? Squidward? Squidward: [sleepily] H-h-huh-huh? SpongeBob: Squidward? Squidward: [sleepily] Whoa. Huh? Wha-what? SpongeBob: Squidward, could we stay here a couple of days or a month or two? Squidward: [sleepily] Uh, yeah, wha-wha-whatever. SpongeBob: Thanks. Thanks, Squidward. [gets in bed with Squidward] Squidward, could you scoot over a little? Squidward: [sleepily] Uh, oh, yeah, sure. [scoots over to the side] SpongeBob: Uh, while you're at it, can you give me a glass of water? Squidward: [sleepily] Okay. Hmmm, yeah, sure. [Sleepily talks a bit, gets out of bed and walks off, then comes back with a glass of water] SpongeBob: Yeah, this is a real swell place you got here. [Squidward hands SpongeBob the glass] Thanks, buddy. Squidward: [sleepily] Uh-huh. Y-you're welcome. [SpongeBob drinks the water] SpongeBob: Yeah, I like sleepovers. Squidward: [sleepily] Yeah. Me, too. SpongeBob: Yep, this is great. Good night, Squidward. Squidward: [yawns] Good night, SpongeBob. [Squidward's eyes pop open realizing what he just did. Squidward opens the door angrily and SpongeBob and Gary walk out] [unhappy] Good night, SpongeBob. [The scene cuts to Bikini Atoll at night then turns to day as the rooster crows to wake everyone up. Squidward opens his eyes excitedly.] Squidward: Tum-ta-dum! Today's the big day, Squidward! Don't wanna be late! [he flies into his closet, gets dressed, and goes outside] Gotta hurry! Hold it! Hold everything! [SpongeBob and Patrick stand outside, with bags] I would not want to miss this. The day SpongeBob moves! I can't believe it's really happening. SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I'll come visit you. Squidward: Don't try to cheer me up, SpongeBob. [changes his smile to a frown briefly] Please. SpongeBob: Here come my parents. [Patrick beings to cry and the car horn sounds as SpongeBob's parents drive up] Mrs. SquarePants: SpongeBob! Hi, honey, we're here! Mr. SquarePants: Come on, SpongeBob, hurry, hurry, son, your mother has dinner waiting. SpongeBob: Hi, Mom. Squidward: Hello, Mrs. SquarePants! Let me help you with these bags. [picks up the bags and carries them to the car] SpongeBob: Just give me a minute. [As Patrick continues to cry in the background, SpongeBob walks back to where his house used to be.] I cannot hold onto you any longer, little pebble. [buries it into the ground in the middle of where his house used to be] You hold too many memories. [as he starts to cry, a tear falls from his nose and into the ground where the seed absorbs it, it then starts to glow. Then SpongeBob shakes Squidward's hand] Well, Squidward, this is goodbye. [walks away] Squidward: Goodbye, SpongeBob, goodbye. [dances] Goodbye, SpongeBob. Bye-bye-bye. Goodbye, SpongeBob. Ha-ha. Goodbye, goodbye. [Patrick lies on the ground, bawling, as SpongeBob gets in the boat] Mrs. SquarePants: Come on, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. [Patrick holds onto the back of the boat, lifting the front into the air, as he cries, begging for SpongeBob to stay.] Squidward: [still dancing] SpongeBob is leaving. He's leaving, he's leaving! [the seed shakes violently] La, la, la, la, la, la, la ha ha ha ha! [the seed shakes even more violently] He leaving, ha ha! [seed still shakes, then it sprouts three roots] SpongeBob is leaving, he's leaving! [suddenly, the ground starts shaking. Squidward stops dancing, while SpongeBob, his parents, and Patrick stare, bemused. A giant green stem grows out of the ground, SpongeBob's house grows from the plant and drops where his old house used to be and on Squidward. The stem then goes back into the ground] SpongeBob: My house is back! [SpongeBob, his parents, and Patrick all happily run into the pineapple] Aww! Good old pineapple! It was exactly where it used to be! [continues praising all of the returned belongings he possessed in his original house. SpongeBob returns to Squidward buried under the floor] Aww, Squidward, isn't this great? I'm back forever! Squidward: [muffled] Forever!?"

  "synopsis": [
   "The episode opens at Mrs. Puff's Boating School when SpongeBob's last boating exam of the year ends in failure after he runs over the French narrator. Despite the failing grade, SpongeBob remains optimistic that his next year in Mrs. Puff's class will be productive. Mrs. Puff, on the other hand, dreads the thought of another year administering boating exams for SpongeBob. In desperation, she offers him an extra credit exam: a short, ten-word thesis on one thing he learned in boating school. SpongeBob finds himself unable to decide what to pick and starts to have a nervous breakdown, but Mrs. Puff lets him pass anyway.As SpongeBob leaves with his new driver's license, Mrs. Puff ponders over whether she's done the wrong thing and starts feeling guilt, then has a terrible daydream of him destroying the town with his driving. She consoles herself with the fact that SpongeBob lacks a boat to drive, much less one to wreck. Upon arriving at her home, however, she finds SpongeBob and his parents inside with a huge cake to thank her for her teachings, as futile as they had once seemed. Both SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff get another surprise when they see that SpongeBob's parents bought him a brand-new boatmobile. In utter amazement, SpongeBob falls into the cake in a dead faint. As SpongeBob's parents take him home, Mrs. Puff realizes the danger he now poses and decides to settle the matter before anyone figures out she let him skip through boating school.SpongeBob's parents tuck him into his bed and tell him that, due to his head injury, he should avoid driving anywhere that night. As soon as his parents leave, he sneaks out his bedroom window, gets into the boat, and falls asleep. Not long after, Mrs. Puff hijacks SpongeBob's boat and drives it away. SpongeBob wakes up to find the masked Mrs. Puff in the process of stealing his vehicle and fights her off.Mrs. Puff tries knocking SpongeBob out of the boat, but he grabs hold of the rear bumper. She next drives through various obstacles to lose him, but he catches up to her while two police officers watch the commotion from their vehicle. In their struggle, SpongeBob ultimately reveals the thief to be Mrs. Puff, rendering him senseless just as the boat crashes into the police car.SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff talk in the Bikini Bottom Jail, where Mrs. Puff is being held. Mrs. Puff apologizes to SpongeBob and says that she shouldn't have passed him when she knew he really wasn't ready. SpongeBob understands he'll have to relinquish his license, but Mrs. Puff tells him he can still continue his lessons with Mrs. Flounder, another driving teacher starting a new class on Monday. SpongeBob assures her she is the only one who he wants teaching him, giving her a tip that the warden will let her go early in exchange for free driving lessons."

   "[It's another day at Mrs. Puff's Boating School as SpongeBob skids along his way to failing his driving test again.] French Narrator: Here we are again at the Bikini Bottom Boating School. Today is once again the day of SpongeBob's boating school exam. But more importantly, this is the last test for the year, [cut to a shot of SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff's car coming straight to the camera] and if SpongeBob does not pass this one, it means another [panicked] whole year of boating school! [shows a static scene as SpongeBob crashes into the camera and glass breaks. Back on regular view, the Narrator who is apparently acting as a cameraman is seen to have fallen over as he groans] SpongeBob: What happened? Mrs. Puff: Oh, nothing, SpongeBob, you just struck another pedestrian. [writes on clipboard] Minus 20 more points. SpongeBob: How many does that leave me with? Mrs. Puff: Negative 224. SpongeBob: How many more minutes left in the test? Mrs. Puff: The test is over. SpongeBob: That's enough time, I can make up those points! [SpongeBob is about to pull into reverse] Mrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, you didn't hear me! [the boat rams into reverse and Mrs. Puff screams] It's too late, SpongeBob! [Mrs. Puff pleads SpongeBob to stop as he knocks over a whole row of cones, knocks through a brick wall and crashes in front of the school's main building. The dust clears] SpongeBob: Okay, Mrs. Puff, what's my final score? Mrs. Puff: Six. SpongeBob: Whoo! And how many do I need to pass? Mrs. Puff: Six. SpongeBob: [raising arms slowly] Whoo. Mrs. Puff: Hundred. [SpongeBob stops] SpongeBob: What? Mrs. Puff: 600. You need 600 to pass. You got six. SpongeBob: Don't worry. I'll be all right, Mrs. Puff. Besides, this means that I get to be in your class for a whole 'nother year! [he slams his fist down, which causes a piece of the motor to fly upward] Well, see you next Tuesday! [SpongeBob walks off and the piece crashes on Mrs. Puff. She inflates like she always does when SpongeBob crashes. SpongeBob runs out to his unicycle-like bike] Yeah! [singing] I'm gonna get my driver's license and it's only gonna take one more year, one more year, one more super duper year. [goes around in circles on his bike] One more super-spectacular, extra-magical, extra-fantastical year! [Mrs. Puff looks on, still inflated] Mrs. Puff: [thinking] Oh, Neptune. Another year with him! Barnacles! Dirty barnacles! I've got to do something to save myself. Oh, there's only one way out: a teacher's ace in the hole! [starts to talk, when she does, she deflates to her normal size] \u266a Extra crediiiiit! \u266a SpongeBob: What was that, Mrs. Puff? [Mrs. Puff runs over and shakes him in joy] Mrs. Puff: Extra credit, SpongeBob! The extra credit! [laughing wildly] I still have a chance! I mean, you still have a chance. SpongeBob: [muffled] What's extra credit? Mrs. Puff: It's when you get credit for the things you weren't able to do before. SpongeBob: [singing] \u266a Oh\u2026 \u266a [cut to SpongeBob at his desk] Mrs. Puff: Now, are we ready for that extra credit? SpongeBob: Extra credit! Mrs. Puff: That's the spirit! So all you have to do to earn your extra credit and pass my class and never have to go anywhere near this school again, is to write a 10-word sentence on what you've learned in boating school. SpongeBob: But I've learned so many things. Mrs. Puff: Just pick one, I don't care which. Here, I'll help you get started. [SpongeBob writes what she says] \"What I learned in boating school is\u2026\" There! That's already seven words! Only three more! SpongeBob: [writing] L\u2026 e\u2026 a\u2026 r\u2026 [pencil snaps] Oh, barnacles. Mrs. Puff: What's wrong? SpongeBob: Got to sharpen my pencil. [SpongeBob whistles as he walks to the sharpener. He then sharpens it multiple times to get just the right sharpness. Mrs. Puff begins to sweat. SpongeBob is finally satisfied and walks back to his desk] N\u2026 e\u2026 Oh! [pencil breaks again, he walks to the sharpener again but Mrs. Puff stops him, grabs the pencil and holds out a pen] Mrs. Puff: Give me that! Here's a pen. SpongeBob: A pen! One of the most permanent of all writing utensils. [walks back to desk singing] Gonna write an essay, that's what I say. [finishes] There. Mrs. Puff: Fantastic, let me see it. SpongeBob: No, wait! I changed my mind! [erases some stuff out] Mrs. Puff: I'm sure what you've written is fine, just let me see. [SpongeBob jumps on top of his paper] SpongeBob: No, don't look! It's not ready. Mrs. Puff: It's so simple, only 10 words! \"What I learned in boating school is blankety, blankety, [her eyes grow bulging veins] blank!\" SpongeBob: I can do this! I can do this! Mrs. Puff: \"What I learned in boating school is\u2026!\" \"What I learned in boating school is\u2026!\" SpongeBob: I can do this! I can do this! [starts to pant] Is it hot in here, Mrs. Puff? Why is it so hot in here? [screams as his hand is cramping] My hand! My hand is cramping, Mrs. Puff! Make it stop! [Mrs. Puff jumps on him and forces the pen to push on the paper] Mrs. Puff: You only need three\u2026 more\u2026 words! [the desk finally collapses and breaks, as Mrs. Puff falls on top of SpongeBob; Mrs. Puff gets off, and reaches for the essay] Okay, let me see what you've written. [SpongeBob grabs it] SpongeBob: It's not ready yet. Mrs. Puff: That's okay, SpongeBob. Show the teacher what you've written. SpongeBob: No! Mrs. Puff: Give it to me! [the two pull on it] SpongeBob: No! Mrs. Puff: Let me see it! [the page rips in half; Mrs. Puff grabs SpongeBob's piece and attempts to read it] \"What I learned in boating school is\u2026\" Uh\u2026 [on the page, it says 'What I learned in boating school is how to drive.' 'School,' 'how' and 'drive' are crossed out and below are pictures of a boat, SpongeBob and a jellyfish] Well, the rest doesn't matter! [throws the two pieces on the floor] You pass! [laughs] You pass! SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I don't feel like I really did anything. Mrs. Puff: That's how extra credit is supposed to feel. SpongeBob: Really? Mrs. Puff: Besides, here's your license. [gives it to SpongeBob] SpongeBob: My license! [licks it] It tastes just like I dreamt it would. Mrs. Puff, I- Mrs. Puff: [dragging him out the door] Thank you, SpongeBob. Congratulations! Have a nice life! SpongeBob: Look out, Bikini Bottom! There's a new driver on the road and his name is...SpongeBob SquarePants! [echoes] SpongeBob SquarePants! SpongeBob SquarePants! [fades to a vision of Mrs. Puff's fears] La La La La! [he hits many pedestrians] La La La La! [he crashes through Harold and Frank] Fish: [crushed by the bus when SpongeBob hits it] Ouch! [A small birthday party is going on] Partygoers: Harris, happy birthday! Happy Birthday! [SpongeBob runs over them] My leg! News Reporter: So much destruction... this reporter asks, \"Why?\" Local consensus places the blame on this negligent, selfish driving instructor who- [SpongeBob runs him over] Oof! SpongeBob: La la la la! Reporter: Let's- not- use that take. [Fades to reality] Mrs. Puff: That's preposterous. He did the extra credit. There's no need to worry. He doesn't even have a boat to drive. [Later that night while walking home] Now to go home and have the rest of that pasta. [she opens the door and turns on the light to see the SquarePants family standing in the center of her living room with a huge round cake in the middle saying, \"Thank You, Mrs. Puff! \"] The SquarePants Family: Surprise! SpongeBob: To the greatest teacher ever! Mr. SquarePants: Thank you, Mrs. Puff. I know I speak for everyone when I say that we consider you a member of the SquarePants family. [kisses her hand for a long while] Mrs. SquarePants: I think you made your point, dear. Mr. SquarePants: Ahem. [blushes, and walks back to the family] Mrs. Puff, we were starting to think SpongeBob was never going to get his license. But you never gave up on him, you never quit, you never took the easy way out! Mrs. Puff: Well, I... Okay. Mrs. SquarePants: We wanted to make sure Mrs. Puff, the greatest driving teacher in the world, was here to see this... Mrs. Puff: See what? Mr. SquarePants: Ta-dah! [reading back license plate] \"IM-RDY\"! Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob: A brand new boatmobile?! SpongeBob: [woozily] For me...? [faints and hits the cake, cutting out a perfect square. The family is in the car ready to drive away with SpongeBob still passed out in the backseat] Mrs. SquarePants: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff... He'll be driving by tomorrow! Toodle-oo! Mrs. Puff: What have I done? Everyone will know I let him slide through school! I'll have to move to new city, start a new boating school with a new name! No. Not again. I've got to end this thing before it begins. [In SpongeBob's bedroom, he's laying in bed with his parents overlooking him] Mr. SquarePants: You took quite a buster there, son. SpongeBob: What I learned in Boating School today is! Mr. SquarePants: We're gonna have to hold off on the driving there for a while, son. Mrs. SquarePants: That's right, honey. Now, just stay in bed, and no going near the boat. [SpongeBob peeks out to see if it's all clear, then slides through the window and floats to his new boat] SpongeBob: Hi, Boaty. [he runs his hand on the side of the boat and gasps] Boaty, you're cold! [he stands up and lays his socks on the side of the door] Take my socks. [he jumps on the side and hugs it] Oh, Boaty, I'm always going to take care of you. You're the best boat in the deep blue sea! [he kisses the throttle lever, sighs, then falls asleep. On the horizon, a shifty dark figure runs by. It's Mrs. Puff, wearing a black ski mask. She peeks over and jumps into the boat, checking to see if the coast is clear] Mrs. Puff: I hope I still remember how to do this. [she takes out a purple balloon and blows it up. She then forms it into a balloon giraffe and snickers to herself] Yeah\u2026 [she starts the boat and drives off. What she doesn't know is that she's sitting on an asleep SpongeBob. He wakes up and sees the sky moving] SpongeBob: Hey, I'm driving! [the two notice each other and scream. Mrs. Puff skids off the road for a bit, then returns to normal. SpongeBob jumps up] Who are you and what are you doing with my boat? And why are you wearing that ski mask?! Because you're not skiing! Oh my gosh, I know who you are! Mrs. Puff: [nervous] No, you don't! You don't know who I am. SpongeBob: Yes, I do! I know that you're... a boat-jacker! I never thought I'd have to use this pepper spray. [takes it out. He sprays, but the nozzle's pointed the wrong way, it gets in his eyes and he screams in pain] Somebody help me! Somebody help me! [Mrs. Puff kicks SpongeBob out of the boat] Mrs. Puff: Sorry, SpongeBob, but it was for your own good. [we see SpongeBob supposedly running next to the boat, but he's actually riding his bike. Mrs. Puff speeds up faster and loses him] SpongeBob: Give me back my boat! [SpongeBob finally catches up to Mrs. Puff and slaps his hand on the windshield. He grabs with both hands and jumps up. Mrs. Puff skids and swerves to get him off, but he's not budging] You'd better stop this boat! [Mrs. Puff slams the brake and SpongeBob falls to the ground. He's still hanging on and running] I'm... not... letting... go! Nothing will stop me! Not even\u2026 [gasps. He sees a sign reading\u2026] Giant clams?! [so, SpongeBob is dragged through a field of giant clams. He comes out with a bunch of pieces missing from him] I'm... not... letting... go... even for... [gasps, when he sees another sign for...] Cheese graters?! [so, he skids through the cheese graters. Now he's just four yellow sponge strands with arms] If you think I'll let go for a little... [he then approaches the most dreaded sign of them all...] educational television?! Oh, no! [cut back to Mrs. Puff as she hears SpongeBob's scream] Mrs. Puff: Looks like that got rid of him. Now for some tunes. [she turns on the radio, which bears a striking resemblance to SpongeBob. It is SpongeBob, in the shape of a radio: his eyes are knobs, his mouth is the speaker, and so on] SpongeBob as Radio: And now back to KRUD, with all of your personal \"you won't get away with stealing my car!\" hits. [Mrs. Puff screams in horror as SpongeBob squeezes out of the box and jumps on Mrs. Puff. They get into a giant brawl and the car goes out of control. Two cops look on] Officer Rob: Hey, look. [the car then flies off a cliff and straight for the squad car. The cops scream in fear and clutch each other. While plummeting, SpongeBob beats up Mrs. Puff during the brawl] SpongeBob: Argh! I'd never let you have this boat! Not even if you were-- [he rips off the ski mask, revealing who the culprit is. He then gasps] Mrs. Puff? [SpongeBob flaps his lips in disbelief in a hypnotic background as the car crashes into the police car. Seconds later, the siren goes off. Later, SpongeBob is calling Mrs. Puff on the phone. Every time a person talks, it cuts to them] So, how's it going, Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: Uh, SpongeBob? I'd like to\u2026 apologize. I shouldn't have passed you. You really weren't ready. SpongeBob: So, I guess I got to give my license back, huh? Mrs. Puff: I hear Mrs. Flounder is starting a new class Monday morning. SpongeBob: You kidding? You're the only teacher for this student [cut to see that Mrs. Puff is talking to SpongeBob from jail, through that visiting window.] And besides, the warden said she'll let you go early, if you do her a favor? Mrs. Puff: What's that? [pan out from the jail exterior] SpongeBob: [from inside] Free driving lessons! [laughs]"

  "synopsis": [
   "The narrator opens the episode by stating \"It is a very special day in Bikini Bottom.\" The camera then shows SpongeBob and Patrick heading down to Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Once they arrive at the entrance, Patrick says he brought SpongeBob's special learning cards that has everything he needs to pass the boating school test. However, Patrick then eats the cards and claims learning tastes good. Even though SpongeBob needed those learning cards, Patrick convinces SpongeBob that he is a winner and does not need them. SpongeBob then claims he is a winner and takes his boating school driving test.Unfortunately, after one minute and thirty-seven seconds, SpongeBob fails the driving test for the 58th time. Patrick, thinking the test is rigged, decides to take the test himself and passes with a perfect score on the first try, much to SpongeBob's surprise and jealousy. They go to receive Patrick's license, but while his picture is being taken, an announcer comes out to reveal that since he is the one millionth person to pass the test, he has won a brand new hot red boatmobile, the new Bass Blaster 3000.SpongeBob and Patrick drive home in Patrick's new boatmobile while Patrick talks about how fun driving is, much to SpongeBob's disappointment. That night, Patrick is heard working on his boatmobile and comes to SpongeBob's door at 4 AM to show his new license. SpongeBob tries to get some sleep, but is woken up the next minute by his alarm clock.SpongeBob, now very tired, tries to walk to work, but, unable to walk because of his tiredness, he eventually gets a ride from Patrick, who rubs his license in SpongeBob's face and brags even more. When SpongeBob gets to work, he tries to talk himself out of riding with Patrick, but finds out that Mr. Krabs has chosen him to run the Krusty Krab's new drive-thru. He meets Patrick and his boat again.At closing time, Patrick drives up, now wearing a racing outfit, claiming that he must keep up his image as an \"expert driver.\" While driving around, Patrick rubs his license in SpongeBob's face even more, even stopping to talk to SpongeBob's parents about it and embarrass SpongeBob. Patrick then starts driving slightly above the speed limit, which prompts SpongeBob to try and get him in trouble for speeding, but he fails since he tells Patrick to stop and a police officer tells him he's going far under the limit. Patrick then runs three red lights, and makes an offscreen illegal U-turn through an orphanage.Furious, SpongeBob finally snaps after Patrick calls himself a \"driving genius,\" admitting his jealousy toward him and this would have been his boat if he passed. Patrick calls out SpongeBob for his jealousy and that he should be happy for him getting his license, but SpongeBob chews his friend back for rubbing his license in his face. Patrick denies this accusation and literally shoves his license between SpongeBob's eyes. In a final fit of fury, an enraged SpongeBob tears up the license and throws it out the window, much to Patrick's despair. This gets the attention of the police officer from earlier and causes a whole squad of cop cars to chase after SpongeBob and Patrick. When the police yell for Patrick to pull over, he instead begins driving out of control, not knowing what to do since he no longer has his license, and eventually drives off of a cliff into the Bikini Bottom Jail yard with the police following after him.Patrick is put on trial and found guilty of littering. The judge gives him 90 days in jail to hold him accountable. However, a remorseful SpongeBob admits the truth and gets the 90 day jail sentence in Patrick's place. When SpongeBob is happily released, he gives a delighted Patrick a new license plate for his boatmobile, but Patrick reveals that he threw out the boatmobile because it stopped working when it got to \"e\" which he thought meant \"end,\" which really meant \"empty\" as in out of gas. As the episode concludes, SpongeBob and Patrick pretend to play boats with SpongeBob putting the license on Patrick's butt and riding him away."

   "French Narrator: It is a very special day in Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob: I'm ready! [walking up to Mrs. Puff's Boating School with Patrick] I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards? Patrick: Right here, buddy. [takes them out of his pocket] Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards. [eats the cards] Mmm. SpongeBob: No, Patrick! Patrick: Hey, learning tastes good. SpongeBob: Patrick, I needed those. Patrick: Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone. SpongeBob: 57 times. Patrick: Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner. SpongeBob: I'm a winner? Patrick: Who's a winner? SpongeBob: [sadly] I'm a winner. Patrick: Who's a winner? SpongeBob: [cheered up a little] I'm a winner. Patrick: Who's a winner?! SpongeBob: I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner! [runs into the classroom] French Narrator: One minute thirty seven seconds later... [SpongeBob walks up crying] Patrick: How'd you do, winner? [SpongeBob's crying continues] Let's see that license. SpongeBob: I didn't get a license, Patrick. Patrick: Are they gonna mail it to you? SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all. Patrick: No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged. SpongeBob: Let's just go home, Patrick. Patrick: We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself. SpongeBob: [hanging onto Patrick's pants] No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive. [Patrick's pants rip off] Patrick: Please, SpongeBob. I think I know what I'm doing. SpongeBob: No, Patrick. No! Mrs. Puff: [Patrick walks up to the boat she is sitting in and gets in it, in his underwear] Good morning. Patrick: You're not the judge of me! Mrs. Puff: Actually, I am. Let the testing begin! [clicks her pen. Scene cuts to SpongeBob, outside the boating school] SpongeBob: I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I? Patrick: SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob: I'm here for you, buddy. Patrick: I passed my test! SpongeBob: You got a perfect score? Patrick: Yeah, I thought you said it was hard. SpongeBob: Perfect score. [eye twitches] Patrick: Come on, I'm gonna get my picture taken for my new license. [scene cuts to the license registration building] Miss Shell: Stand behind the line, sir. Patrick: [smiling] How do I look? SpongeBob: [sarcastically] Like a winner. Miss Shell: Ready? Patrick: Ready. [banner comes down which says \"CONGRATULATIONS\" on it. Balloons and confetti fall] SpongeBob: Huh? Fish: Congratulations, Mr. Star. You're the one millionth person to pass the test. Patrick: Does that mean I get a free key chain? Fish: Uhh, no. Patrick: Oh. Fish: You get a brand-new boat mobile. The new Bass Blaster 3000. The ultimate boating machine. [Patrick runs up to the new boatmobile as SpongeBob's jaw drops] Patrick: Yeah! All right! Fish: Women will want you. [all sigh] Men will want to be you. [all faint] You'll be the envy of your friends. [SpongeBob growling in fury] Patrick: Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat. SpongeBob: I'm so happy for you... [\"La Cucaracha\" horn blows in his face] Whoa! Patrick: The horn works. [scene cuts to Patrick driving his new boat down the road] Woo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license. Patrick: Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license. SpongeBob: Two millionth? Patrick: Then you can get a free boat just like me. SpongeBob: Yeah, just like you. Patrick: I try to serve as an inspiration to others. SpongeBob: Can we go home now? [zoom out and scene shows Patrick driving around his rock over and over] We've been driving around your house for hours. Patrick: I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it? SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride, Patrick. Patrick: No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian. [shudders then drives off. SpongeBob imitates Patrick. Scene cuts to SpongeBob in bed asleep. His clock turns to 3:00am when an engine revving is heard which sends SpongeBob into his diving board then back into his bed] SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing? Patrick: I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep. [SpongeBob groans and slams his window shut, breaking it, before going back to bed. Scene cuts to 4:00am] SpongeBob: 4:00? [yawns. Doorbell rings] Who could be at the door at this hou\u2014 [falls down the stairs. Opens the door] Now what is it, Patrick? Patrick: You will never guess what happen to me today. SpongeBob: You got your license. Patrick: Yeah! [shows his license] But that's not all. SpongeBob: You got a new boat. Patrick: Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life. [walks off] SpongeBob: [gets back into bed] Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep. [foghorn alarm blows] Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat. [scene cuts to morning where SpongeBob is leaving home to go to work] I'm so tired. [horn honks] Patrick: Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work? SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work. [tries to take a step, but falls down in the process. Scene cuts to Patrick driving SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab] Patrick: Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license. SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride. Patrick: No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license. [SpongeBob is getting extremely enraged] SpongeBob: That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile... Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru. SpongeBob: When did we get a drive-thru? Mr. Krabs: I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams. SpongeBob: I used to have a dream. Mr. Krabs: Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living. SpongeBob: [through headphones] Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I\u2014 [\"La Cucaracha\" horn honks] Patrick: The horn still works. [scene cuts to SpongeBob switching the OPEN sign to CLOSED then walking out of work. Patrick drives up in a racing uniform] Hey, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: What's with the helmet, Patrick? Patrick: Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image. [clicks tongue] SpongeBob: Uh-huh. [scene cuts to Patrick driving] Patrick: Boy, driving is so easy. SpongeBob: Oh? Patrick: Do you want me to give you lessons? SpongeBob: [sarcastic] Oh, that would be great. Patrick: Oh! [drives over to SpongeBob's parents] SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick: Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy. Mr. SquarePants: Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you? We're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours. Patrick: What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test. Mrs. SquarePants: That's great, Patrick. Patrick: SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it. Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield. SpongeBob: Mom! Patrick: Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides. SpongeBob: Hey! [Patrick drives off] Mr. SquarePants: Even Patrick has a license. [both parents sigh] Patrick: Let's see what this baby can do. [steps on the gas. Ride pass a sign that reads 'SPEED LIMIT 40 MPH'] SpongeBob: Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph. Patrick: Yeah, yeah. SpongeBob: [reads the speedometer] 40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car. [car stops next to a policeman] Patrick: What? Where? Who? SpongeBob: Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun? Officer: Umm... okay. [uses radar gun. It reads 0mph] Actually, he's going 40mph under the limit. So, move along before I run you in, tattletale. [drives off] SpongeBob: Are you sure you don't want to run him in? [scene cuts to Patrick driving. Green light turns red] It's a red light, Patrick! [Patrick runs through three red lights] Patrick, you just ran three red lights! Patrick: So? SpongeBob: You're suppose to stop! Patrick: I think the driving genius knows what he's doing. SpongeBob: [finally snaps] Driving genius?! Would a genius make an illegal u-turn...through an orphanage?! Patrick: They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about? SpongeBob: I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile! Patrick: How can you say that? If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license! SpongeBob: If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face! Patrick: I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face! [takes out license and rubs it in SpongeBob's face--literally--which makes muffled noises] SpongeBob: [fixes his face and then furiously snatches Patrick's license out of his hand] Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this! [furiously tears up Patrick's license then laughs maniacally. The pieces of the license fly into the cop's hands.] Officer: Huh, litterbugs. This is why I joined the force. [drives off after SpongeBob & Patrick] SpongeBob & Patrick: It's the police! Officer: [over speaker] Pull it over, litterbug! Patrick: Litterbug?! No! [drives faster] Officer: Ooh, I got me a runner. [a bunch of police cars are following him] SpongeBob: Patrick, what do you think you're doing? Patrick: I don't know! I don't have a license anymore. [drives around cards, through a sign then off a cliff into the front lot of the Bikini Bottom Jail. Scene cuts to courtroom] Judge: 90 days. I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering. Patrick: So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. [a security guard takes him away, but he ducks his head back in] Sometimes you forget to feed him. [ducks out of the shot] SpongeBob: What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait! [runs up to the judge] Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead. Judge: Well, considering there's no legal precedent... oh, what the heck. 90 days! [a smiling SpongeBob is put in jail] French Narrator: One debt to society later... [After SpongeBob's 90 day sentence, shows the jail as the door buzzes. SpongeBob is let go out of jail where Patrick is waiting for him; the two silently stare at each other smiling for about ten seconds as an orchestra swells dramatically.] SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick: SpongeBob! [both hug] SpongeBob: I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever. [shows him a license plate that reads \"PALS 4 EVER\"] Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy. Patrick: Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore. SpongeBob: What? Patrick: It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E, and I figured that must mean \"end\". SpongeBob: Oh, then... what do we do with this? [Patrick takes it and puts it on his behind] Patrick: How's that? SpongeBob: Yeah! Patrick: Ready, buddy? SpongeBob: Ready, pal. [hops on Patrick's shoulders and makes car noises] Woo! Woo!"

  "synopsis": [
   "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob is getting ready for bed. However, he is so excited about going to work the next day that he cannot fall asleep. After speedily running around, it does not tire him. He drinks a glass of warm snail milk, which causes him to fall asleep within moments.The next morning, SpongeBob wakes up and finds out he overslept. He desperately rushes to get to the Krusty Krab (Additionally forgetting his left shoe behind), even jumping over an unfinished bridge that is over a cliff to get there on time. Right when he puts his employee timecard in the slot, the clock changes to 9:01 AM, making him one minute late. Worried that Mr. Krabs will punish him for being one minute late, SpongeBob begins working in overdrive to try and make up for his lost minute. Soon, Mr. Krabs notices his jumpiness and checks on him, but SpongeBob breaks down, telling Mr. Krabs that he was tardy, and he begs Mr. Krabs to not throw him out. Mr. Krabs does not scold him that much (even saying \"Um... don't do it again.\"), but at SpongeBob's request, Mr. Krabs makes him clean the salad bar. Later when it is quitting time, Squidward sarcastically suggests to SpongeBob that he should live at the Krusty Krab if he loves it so much. That night, SpongeBob brings his bed to the Krusty Krab and sleeps there.The next morning, Mr. Krabs is shockingly startled by SpongeBob's bed. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that he is going to live at the Krusty Krab from then on. When Squidward finds out, he is overjoyed. That night, SpongeBob brings all of his furniture to the Krusty Krab to make himself feel more at home.The next morning, Squidward is thrilled that SpongeBob no longer lives next door to him. He happily tells the news to a customer. Later, when the customer asks Squidward for change, he gives him two socks and a pair of underwear. Squidward then notices the whole cash register is filled with socks and underwear. He asks SpongeBob why they are in there and where the money is. SpongeBob then says that the money is now being kept in a pickle jar. More socks and underwear are hanging up on a clothesline. A customer then takes a pair of underwear, thinking it is a napkin. SpongeBob then explains to Squidward that Gary has the mustard.Later, SpongeBob moves his furniture into Mr. Krabs' office. He pleads Mr. Krabs to stay in his office, under the condition of raising rent. Then, SpongeBob's parents come to the Krusty Krab. Gary's trail of slime gets all over the floor and customers keep slipping on it and injuring themselves. Luckily, Gary is carrying a \"wet floor\" sign. A customer (who has Gary sticking onto his leg) asks SpongeBob if Gary is his snail, and SpongeBob becomes angry at Gary for his behavior and removes him from the customer's leg. The customer then tells SpongeBob to put Gary on a leash as he goes back to his table.Not only has SpongeBob put his furniture in Mr. Krabs' office, he also places fancy smelling soaps in the restrooms, and knitting napkin holders and embroidering the menus in the dining area, to the chagrin of Squidward and Mr. Krabs who believes SpongeBob is taking the manliness out of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs becomes furious when he notices floral print shower curtains in his office. He threatens to tear them down, but when he does, he accidentally finds Margaret SquarePants taking a shower, apologizing to her. Outraged, Harold SquarePants comes in and angrily beats up Mr. Krabs who flees crazily. The customers leave the Krusty Krab in disgust when they find out SpongeBob is shaving Patrick's back hair in the kitchen and Mr. Krabs cries for his loss of customers. Fed up with SpongeBob's antics, an infuriated Mr. Krabs forces SpongeBob to move out of the Krusty Krab and go back to his pineapple house.SpongeBob moves back to his house and plays his very loud drums, much to Squidward's dismay, who cries in agony. The next morning, Mr. Krabs returns to the Krusty Krab, but finds out that all of Squidward's stuff from his house is inside as he decided to live at the restaurant, so he won't have to have SpongeBob for a neighbor (and probably to get back at Krabs for kicking SpongeBob out), much to the chagrin of Mr. Krabs who yells \"Squidward!\" ending the episode."

   "SpongeBob: Gotta hurry, Gary! [rushes to put on his pajamas on, while Gary slithers over to where he sleeps] The sooner I get to bed, the sooner I'll get to sleep, and the sooner I get to sleep, the sooner I'll wake up, and the sooner I wake up, ooh ho-ho! [stops in the middle of the room] The sooner I get to go to work at the best job in the whole wide world: The Krusty Krab!  Now, to just put on these sleepy time blinders, before I run excitedly to bed. [puts on his blinders and tries running, but trips on a treasure chest and falls down. He quickly gets into bed without the blinders] Well, good night, Gary. Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: I'm just going to turn out the lights. [turns off his light switch] Clickety poo! And close my eyes and go to sleep. [Gary is already asleep; close-up of his face] Just close my eyes and go to sleep. [grunts trying to close his eyes but can't] ...just close my... [his eyes shoot open] Maybe if I run around it'll tire me out. [runs around the room and on the walls] Oh, I just got to get some sleep! There's only one thing for this. [bubble transition to SpongeBob holding a glass of milk] Ah, that's the stuff. A glass of warm snail milk. [drinks all the milk, then waits for a few seconds] Dah! Why isn't it working-- [falls over suddenly, finally asleep. The next morning, the clam outside crows like a rooster, which wakes SpongeBob up. He looks disgusting and disturbed due to the place in which he slept] Whoa, Gary, what happened? [remembers what time it is and crashes through his front door with all his clothes on except for his left shoe and sock, which the former is still in his home] Agh, I'm late for work! [checks his pocket watch] Oh, my gosh, only twenty seconds to go! What the...? [sees the bridge ahead is out] Bridge out? [jumps over the gap and continues to run then gasps again when he sees Nancy, Abigail, and Shelly playing hopscotch up ahead] Hopscotch! [skips across the hopscotch board and keeps running] Almost there. [runs into the Krusty Krab and lunges at the time clock with his time slip in hand. The clock turns to 9:01 just as he puts the card into the slot. A balloon deflating is heard.] No! I'm late. What's Mr. Krabs going to say? [he goes into the kitchen, and his thoughts can be heard as he grills patties] TardyPants! You, sir, are a TardyPants! Wait 'till Mr. Krabs finds out. You better think of something to save your job. Squidward: One Krabby Patty and Krabby Fries for table four. SpongeBob: Order up! [runs to the table] Here you go, sir. One Krabby Patty, Krabby Fries, and Krabby Drink in three seconds flat. [A little girl knocks her drink off the table.] Squidward: Spill at table... SpongeBob: [runs out of the kitchen with a mop] I'm on it! [starts to mop up the spill] Nothing a dedicated, on-time employee can't handle. [mops the girl's head] Kiddies get a free touch-up. [giggles as he goes back into the kitchen] All done! Mr. Krabs: [opens the door] Hey, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: [jumps into the air and grabs Mr. Krabs' leg] No! Please don't throw me out in the street! I'm so sorry for what I did! Mr. Krabs: What'd you do? SpongeBob: I was a minute late for work! Mr. Krabs: A minute late? SpongeBob: A whole 60 seconds. Mr. Krabs: Well, uh, don't do it again. SpongeBob: No! No! You have to punish me! Mr. Krabs: What? Uh, okay, uh, then, wipe down the salad bar. SpongeBob: [salutes] Aye aye sir. Mr. Krabs: And goodnight. SpongeBob: I love it here, Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sheesh. Squidward: [sarcastically] If you love it so much, why don't you just live here? [chuckling] [SpongeBob grins, getting an idea. Cut to SpongeBob straining to get his feet through a cardboard box he's going to sleep in. He gets his feet through the box and uses napkins as a blanket.] SpongeBob: Somethin's not right. What is it? Do I miss my old clock? [there is a shot of the digital wall clock which says 12:31] Maybe it's my old bed. [quickly wiggles his toes] Oh, that's it. [snaps his fingers] I'll make the Krusty Krab just like home. What do you say, Gary? [Gary is a toilet paper roll with cucumbers for eyes. Cut to next day where Mr. Krabs enters the Krusty Krab and sees SpongeBob sleeping in his bed in the dining area] Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? What in Neptune's Navy is going on here? SpongeBob: SpongeBob reporting for duty, sir. Mr. Krabs: How long you been here? SpongeBob: All night, sir. Mr. Krabs: All night? SpongeBob: That's right, I'm going to live here from now on, so I'll never ever be tardy pants again. Mr. Krabs: Hold on! This ain't no hotel, son. SpongeBob: [gets out a stack of cash from his pocket] Here's my first month's rent. Mr. Krabs: Rent? Okay. Well, let's get ready for the customers. Start scrubbing the grill... SpongeBob: Already done, sir. [grill is spotless] Mr. Krabs: Well, start cooking some Krabby Patties... SpongeBob: Done. [a bunch of Krabby Patties are in the kitchen ready for serving. SpongeBob punches his time card at 8:59] All that, before we even open up our doors, sir. Mr. Krabs: Okay. Then get cleaned up. You're a mess. SpongeBob: Eww, I guess I could use some freshening up. [ketchup and mustard stains are all over his clothes. Cut to Squidward putting a bucket of dishes on the conveyor belt but the dishwasher stops] Squidward: Jammed again. [reaches inside to fix it but pokes SpongeBob] SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is wearing a shower cap and towel] Ooh. Hi, Squidward. Squidward: SpongeBob? What are you doing here? SpongeBob: Oh, I live here now. Squidward: In the dishwasher? SpongeBob: No, at the Krusty Krab. Now, if you'll excuse me. Squidward: SpongeBob living at the Krusty Krab? Wait a minute, if he's living here, that means he won't be living next to me. [is shown lying in a field of flowers, but it turns out to be on the Krusty Krab floor] Mr. Krabs: Must be a full moon. [cut to closing time] Mr. Squidward? Squidward: Just saying goodnight to SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs. Sweet dreams, SpongeBob. You look much more comfier in here than in your old home. SpongeBob: Won't you miss me living next door, Squidward? Squidward: [stifled laughing] No. Coming, Eugene. [cheers as he walks out the Krusty Krab] Good night's sleep, here I come. [cut to next day where Squidward is talking to Frankie] And when I went home that night, guess what? Frankie: He wasn't there? Squidward: Right! And when I woke up in the morning... Frankie: Can I just get my change? Squidward: [laughing] He still wasn't there. Frankie: Come on, man, my change. Squidward: [grabs something out of the register] Here you go. Frankie: Yeah, thanks... [gasps] Oh, real funny, buddy. Two socks and a pair of tighty whities. Squidward: Socks and-- [gasps. socks and underwear are in the register instead of money] What the...? SpongeBob, why is your underwear in the cash register? SpongeBob: Well, I had to put them somewhere and my underwear drawer is all filled up with Krabby Patties and the freezer is filled up with my iced snowflake collection. [blocks of snowflakes are in the freezer] So I put the cash from the cash register in the pickle jar. Squidward: What? Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Oh, lighten up, Squidward. 'Tis harmless tomfoolery. SpongeBob: Do you want to know where the mustard is? [Gary is covered in mustard] Squidward: Ah! Eww. [cut to later] Well, he may be twice as annoying at work, but it still beats having him as a neighbor. SpongeBob: [sings] Laundry song, la-la-la! Sing about your laundry all day long. La-la-la-la-laundry song. Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you can't be hanging your delicates in me customer's faces. [Harold sees underwear and stops chewing] SpongeBob: Well, they don't see to mind. [Harold takes down a pair of underwear and uses it as a napkin] Mr. Krabs: Oh! I have a disgusting clientele. Who spend their money freely. SpongeBob: [chuckles] Aye aye, captain. Mr. Krabs: Because I'd hate for a certain living arrangement\u2014meaning yours\u2014to interfere with said money spending. [tries opening his office door but can't] What the barnacles? [opens the door slightly to see all of SpongeBob's stuff in his office] SpongeBob! Why is your bed in me office? SpongeBob: It was getting kind of crowded in the kitchen. [squeezes inside the office] So I moved in here. Mr. Krabs: You can't stay in here. These are my private quarters, boy. The only place I can escape for solitude during the day. SpongeBob: But I'll only be here at night. Please, Mr. Krabs, I won't get in your way. Please! Mr. Krabs: Oh... Okay, but I'll have to raise your rent. SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, Mr... [doorbell rings. SpongeBob gasps] My parents! Mr. Krabs: Your parents? SpongeBob: [opens up front doors] Mom! Dad! Come on in. [enters Mr. Krabs' office] And this is the guest room. Mom, Dad, Mr. Krabs. Margaret SquarePants: Oh, hello. [Mr. Krabs' eye twitches. In the dining area, Harold and Frankie are slipping on snail trail that Gary is leaving on the floor] SpongeBob: Well, I'll let you two get settled. Jimmy: Is this your snail? SpongeBob: [gasps] Gary! Bad boy! No! Jimmy: Put that thing on a leash. Mr. Krabs: [holding golden clam-shaped soap containers in his hand] Squidward, who put these fancy-smelling soaps in the restroom? Squidward: The same person who knitted these napkin holders and embroidered the menus. [shows both items] Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Argh. [walks to his office] That boy's taking the manliness out of me restaurant. Oh, he didn't. Floral print curtains in me office? That's it. That's the last straw! I'm not putting up with this any longer. [rips curtains down to reveal Margaret SquarePants taking a shower] Margaret SquarePants: Oh! Mr. Krabs: Oh, oh, I...I'm sorry. I didn't know... [walks backwards into Harold SquarePants] Harold SquarePants: [angered] What's going on in here?! Mr. Krabs: No, I... [thrown out of his office. Hears buzzing in the kitchen] What the...? Patrick: [walks out of the kitchen] Thanks, SpongeBob. If I could reach it, I'd do it myself. [points to his lower back, background woman screaming plays as all the customers run out in disgust] Mr. Krabs: [shrieking] Me customers! [cries] Gone! Gone! All they wanted... was to give me...their money! [strained cries.. then gets enraged] SpongeBob! [Whistle Blowing] Pack your bags, boy! You're moving out! [SpongeBob is shaving in the kitchen. Meanwhile, Squidward is about to relax in his lawn chair when a moving truck drives up] Squidward: What the...? SpongeBob, what are you doing here? SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs kicked me out, so now we're neighbors again. Hey, my drums! [plays the drums frantically.] Squidward: No...! [cries on the ground in agony. Cut to the next day where Mr. Krabs returns to the Krusty Krab, only to discover that now all of Squidward's stuff is inside] Mr. Krabs: [yelling] Squidward!"

  "synopsis": [
   "SpongeBob and Patrick are at Near Mint Comic Books, and Patrick sees an ad for a mail-in offer promising to adapt a poem into a song. Patrick has a flashback while he is trying to write his poem at SpongeBob's house. He remembers a time from when he was younger in which he recited the poem: \"Roses are blue. Violets are red. I have to go to the bathroom.\" The gym teacher told him that he had told him repeatedly that it was gym class, so he had the class throw dodgeballs at him.Nonetheless, he has a plan to write his song fast so it would be a masterpiece and he would not get hit by dodgeballs again. Patrick takes SpongeBob's comic book money to enter $100 and submits an entry called \"I Wrote This.\" The song does not make much sense, and it is so awful that even the paper smells terrible when he submits it  and the band that plays it die after recording it. When the two listen to the song through a large loudspeaker, it turns out to be so bad that it melts down SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob, however, assures Patrick that it is the greatest song ever made, so he and Patrick try to get the song on the radio.At the K-BLUB radio station, they are immediately kicked out, so, finding a different method, they climb up the radio tower and use a piece of chewed gum to stick the record player to the top of the antenna. The song is heard throughout the town, which causes rioting, literal head explosions, and a plane crash into a fireworks storage building. The town hates the song so much that they form an angry mob, which is headed by Fred. They yell about how much they hate the song and run SpongeBob and Patrick down to the ground.While it looks like they are getting beat up, it turns out that SpongeBob and Patrick are making random noises with musical instruments and a chainsaw. Patrick said that was his new song called, \"Aargh!\" which the mob admits is not that bad, and is better than the first one Patrick made. Patrick starts to sing the song in front of everyone until his old gym teacher arrives, saying that Patrick never learned his lesson, which leads to the two getting humiliated as the angry crowd pelts them with dodgeballs as punishment for writing both Patrick's original poem and that awful song."

   "Patrick: [reading a comic book. Screams] No, no! [starts crying then stops] Yay! [laughs] Nerd: Well, if only Inaudible Lad were here right now. Patrick: Oh. [eats comic book] Nothing satisfies like a good story. SpongeBob: [walks up to Patrick with a stack of comic books] Are ya ready to go, Patrick? Patrick: [screams] Get back, I wasn't going to eat all of you! SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me! Patrick: Sponge-- [burps and a piece of paper lands into SpongeBob's face] SpongeBob: Ew, what's this? Patrick: [takes the piece of paper] Well, whatever it is, it's mine! Unless I don't want it! [inspects the piece of paper and gasps] SpongeBob, what do all these words say? SpongeBob: It's an ad. [talks in an announcer tone] Dear Comic Book Reader. Patrick: That's me! SpongeBob: [continues as announcer] Have you ever thought about turning one of your poems into a hit song on the radio? Patrick: I never thought about anything! SpongeBob: [continues] Send in your poem and $100 and we'll make it a hit! [uses regular tone of voice again] Can we go now? My arms are getting tired. Patrick: I want to send in a poem, and everyone would love it, and I would be a star! SpongeBob: You can't always trust ads in comic books. Those X-Ray specs I ordered couldn't see through people's skin at all! [makes a disgusted face] Only their clothes! Plus, you don't have $100. [SpongeBob's wallet falls out of his and struggles to pick it up] Patrick, could you get my wallet? [Patrick picks up SpongeBob's wallet] Patrick: Hey, look. [pulls out $100 bill from wallet] I just found $100! It's a sign that I should make my hit record. SpongeBob: Hey, that's my comic book money! Patrick: [indignant] It's a sign! A sign that fell from the back of your pants. I've learned to trust signs like that. [walks away] SpongeBob: Patrick. [the comic book store clerk shows up] Comic Book Store Clerk: Hey, you going to pay for those comics? [SpongeBob's arms fall off with the comics] SpongeBob: No. [gets kicked out] Ow! Can I have my arms back? [Bubble transition to SpongeBob's house.] Patrick: I wish not to be disturbed, SpongeBob, for I am about to erupt with a masterpiece. [walks away] SpongeBob: Good luck. [doorbell rings] Coming-- [Patrick slams door against SpongeBob] Patrick: SpongeBob, could I borrow a pencil and some paper and a place to work? [cut to Patrick at the desk] Patrick: [hovering the pencil over the paper] SpongeBob! This pencil is broken! Why won't it make words? SpongeBob: You have to think of the words yourself. [walks away with the laundry] Patrick: I think I wrote a poem once. [flashback to Patrick's childhood] Young Patrick: A Poem, by Patrick Star. Roses are blue, violets are red, I have to go to the bathroom. [eats his poem and then burps and takes a bow] Gym Teacher: How many times do I gotta tell ya? This is Gym Class! [blows whistle and everyone starts throwing dodgeballs at Patrick, who takes cover] Patrick: [present time] Ohh, dodgeballs. SpongeBob: [shadow figure of himself holding a dodgeball and wearing an evil grin] Oh, Patrick! Patrick: [screams] Don't hit me with a dodgeball! [hides under the desk and SpongeBob turns on the lights and Gary pops out of his shell] Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Why would I hit you with a dodgeball? Patrick: I've never told anyone this, I wrote a poem once. SpongeBob: [gets shocked] No! Patrick: Wait! There's more. When I read it to the class, they pelted me with dodgeballs! Just because we were playing dodgeball! [starts crying] Whyyyyyy?! [dramatic music plays] SpongeBob: [stops Gary's record player] You can play your records later, Gary. Patrick, is that why you've been having trouble writing? Patrick: I'm worried my poem's not gonna be any good and you're going to hit me with dodgeballs. SpongeBob: Oh, I don't even own a dodgeball. Do you, Gary? Gary: [saying no suspiciously] Meow. Patrick: If you're serious, I can do this. I'm even gonna use my brain. SpongeBob: That's the spirit, Patrick! I'll open a window. [cut to SpongeBob's house with an opened window with Patrick struggling to write the poem] Patrick: [tapping his head with the pencil] Come on, you stupid brain! Work! [Patrick's brain starts working and smoke comes out] It's working! [struggling as he starts writing] SpongeBob: [knocking] Patrick, don't strain yourself. [Patrick continues struggling as Squidward opens the window] Squidward: Now, what's going on? [smells and smoke and reacts in disgust] What is that horrible smell? [SpongeBob comes out] Is Patrick thinking again? Patrick: I'm making art! Squidward: Patrick, it smells like something crawled in your brain and died. Patrick: That's the creative process at work! [Squidward closes the window] Ready to go to the post office? [shows a letter with his poem in it] I need to mail in my masterpiece. French Narrator: The next day... [cut to Bigshot Records] Lead Singer: \u266a--and that's why you're my cookie-wookie teddy bear!\u266a Guitarist #1: I hate my life. Keyboardist: I hate your life, too, dude. Band Manager: People! We have 17 more songs to finish this hour! Next up is: \"I Wrote This\" by Patrick Star. [sniffs then holds his nose] Yick. [Guitarist #2 then takes it] Guitarist #2: This one's really bad! It made my eyeballs throw up. Guitarist #1: Oh, yeah... [eyes shrink, disintegrate and crumble into ashes] Band Manager: I don't care how awful his poem is! We spent his 100 bucks already! Guitarist #1: Come on, guys. We're going to do this if it kills us. And a 1, and a 2 and a-- [cut to the cemetery where the band members are buried] Charlie: [grave voice] They wanted you to have this. Patrick: My song. Ahh... [cut to SpongeBob's house] SpongeBob: [excitedly] Come on, let's hear it. Patrick: Um, I don't know. You're not gonna throw any dodgeballs at me? SpongeBob: I don't see any dodgeballs here, buddy. Just an artist and his work. Patrick: Yeah; and me too! Now sit down and get comfortable. SpongeBob: [sits on his red life preserver arm chair, while Patrick pushes a big stereo sound system in front of him] Uh, Patrick? Patrick: [on top of the stereo] SpongeBob SquarePants! Are you ready to rock?! [cheers] [SpongeBob screams as Patrick lands on the chair and turns on the music, which blasts loudly through the stereo] SpongeBob: [covering his ears] It's really loud! Patrick: You need it louder?! Okay! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Lead singer: [singing Patrick's song] \u266aTwinkle, twinkle, Patrick Star. I made myself a sandwich. My mommy named it Fred. It tastes like beans and bacon. And it smells like it's been dead. [Gary hears the song and quickly went into his shell and comes out with earmuff] Writing stuff is hard so I use a pointy pencil. Pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, point. [Patrick shakes his head to the music and sings along but saying La,La, La] P.U., what's that horrible smell?\u266a Singer: Drum Solo! [plays drum solo. Wallpaper peels and plants become dead and picture of Mr. and Mrs. SquarePants shakes] Lead Singer: \u266aI have a head, it ends in a point. pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, point.\u266a [in their picture, Mr. and Mrs. SquarePants get annoyed and Mrs. SquarePants turns the picture over] \u266aThis song is over, except for this line, you win this round, broccoli!\u266a [the song ends as SpongeBob's house collapses and the stereo crashes on top of SpongeBob and Patrick] Patrick: That was awesome! Did you like it or did you really, really like it? Give me your completely honest opinion of how great it was. SpongeBob: [looking like he wants to insult it] Oh...hmm... how do I put this delicately-- That was the best song I ever heard! Patrick: Do you really think so? SpongeBob: We need to get that song on the radio! Patrick: Then let's go right now, come on! [takes SpongeBob's arm off] SpongeBob: Darn, I just got that arm back. [cut to the radio station where SpongeBob and Patrick are going to put the song on the radio] Patrick: I can't wait to see look on their face once they hear this. [they go inside and employee screams and kicks them out and closes the door] SpongeBob: Did you see the look on his face? Patrick: Yeah. Did you see his ears? SpongeBob: I didn't know they could turn inside out like that. Now, how are we going to get your record on the radio? Patrick: What record? [they see the antenna] SpongeBob: I got an idea! [cut to later where SpongeBob and Patrick are on the roof. Wind howls as SpongeBob and Patrick shiver] We just have to play your record from the top of this antenna. Patrick: Carry me? SpongeBob: Huh? Patrick-- [Patrick lands on top of SpongeBob and SpongeBob picks him up, struggling] Patrick: Tally ho! Mush! Onward and upward! [SpongeBob is struggling to get to the top of the antenna] Faster, SpongeBob! Faster! [Patrick sees a satellite go by. They get to the top of the antenna. Patrick stands on SpongeBob's face, takes out his record player and then puts it on the top of the antenna, the record player wobbles and falls off and Patrick catches it] Oh! Hmm-- this record won't stay put. SpongeBob: [mumbling inaudibly] Patrick: Good idea. [takes out bubble gum and throws it in his mouth and chews on it, while making noises and he blows a bubble] SpongeBob: [mumbling impatiently.] [Bubble pops and sticks to Patrick's mouth] Patrick: Oh, yeah. I forgot. [pulls gum off and sticks it to the bottom of the record player and puts it on the top of the antenna and turns on the music. Ralph is walking past a radio in a store] Lead Singer: \u266aTwinkle, twinkle, Patrick Star--\u266a Ralph: [screams. Billy is driving his boat] Lead Singer: \u266a--I made myself a sandwich, my mommy named it Fred--\u266a Billy: [screams] It's! In! My head! [continues screaming as boat spins around and crashes] Lead Singer: \u266a--It tastes like beans and bacon, and smells like it's been dead,\u266a [two fish are walking around, listening to music] \u266aWriting stuff is hard so I use a pointy pencil--\u266a [Jimmy's head disappears] Frank: Lucky. Lead Singer: \u266a--Pointy, Pointy, Pointy, Pointy, Pointy, Point--\u266a Harold: [to his girlfriend, Evelyn who are at the beach as the song plays] This song always makes me think of you. Lead Singer: \u266a--P.U., what's that horrible smell?\u266a Singer: Drum solo! [plays drum solo as Evelyn hits her boyfriend, who goes flying. Everyone screams and runs around because of the song. Scooter and the lifeguard tip the boat over] Billy: Stop! Lead Singer: \u266a--I have a head, it ends in a point--\u266a Fish: [covering his ears] My ears! [they pull the controls off and they jump out of the plane with parachutes] Lead Singer: \u266a--Pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, point--\u266a [the plane lands into a fireworks storage, it explodes and fireworks start] \u266a--This song is over, except for this line--\u266a Old Man Walker: I like it. [hums the song] Lead Singer: \u266a--you win this round, broccoli!\u266a [song ends but begins again. SpongeBob and Patrick see that Bikini Bottom's having a party] SpongeBob: Well, it looks like Bikini Bottom is throwing a party. and you know what a party needs. Patrick: Uh, bean dip? SpongeBob: Yes, that is important. But I was thinking about music! Turn it up, Patrick! [Patrick turns the volume up] Lead Singer: \u266aIt tastes like beans and bacon--\u266a Fred: [covering his ears] Where is that awful song coming from? Lead Singer: \u266a--And it smells like it's been dead--\u266a Fred: [points to the radio station] To the radio station! [everyone marches angrily to the radio station] Lou: Torches! Get your torches! [everyone gets a torch] Harold: Pitchforks! You can't be an angry mob without pitchforks! [everyone gets a pitchfork] Peterson: Cotton Candy! Get your cotton candy! Can't throw a riot without cotton candy! [everyone misses the cotton candy. SpongeBob and Patrick climb down the antenna] Lead Singer: \u266a--I have a head. It ends in a point--\u266a SpongeBob: Look at that, Patrick! [the angry mob is coming] Patrick: Oh, you mean the angry mob with the pitchforks and torches? SpongeBob: [laughs] That's not an angry mob, Patrick. It's your fan club! Patrick: Fan club? [song ends as the angry mob chatters indistinctly] Yee-whoo! We should sing them a song! Fred: Who's responsible for that song on the radio? [SpongeBob and Patrick jump off the roof] SpongeBob: Why, he's right here. Patrick Star, Musical Genius. [Patrick drones and burps] Fred: Let's get 'em, boys! [they start chasing them. SpongeBob & Patrick found a cure. they beat them up but SpongeBob and Patrick play with instruments wildly. Patrick plays with a guitar, while SpongeBob plays with a chainsaw and a tambourine. They pant heavily while they got rid of the mob] Patrick: And that was my new song called, \"Ay...\" Fred: You know, It's not that bad. Jimmy: Yeah. At least it got that first terrible song out of our heads. Patrick: Oh, yeah. My song. [strums his guitar] Oh, Twinkle, Twinkle, Patrick Star-- [they hear a whistle blow and it was Patrick's gym teacher from the childhood] Gym Teacher: Patrick! Looks like you need another lesson! Dodgeballs ready! [everyone gets out a dodgeball] Patrick: Uh-oh. [everyone starts throwing dodgeballs at SpongeBob and Patrick, who take cover as the episode ends]"

  "synopsis": [
   "In the beginning of the episode, Pearl is getting ready for her slumber party, but Mr. Krabs' meddling in the party preparations is getting out of control. Eventually, Pearl kicks him out of the house, so Mr. Krabs decides to stay at SpongeBob's house. There, SpongeBob puts on a movie that shows girls having a slumber party and inviting their gangster boyfriends, who begin vandalizing the house. Mr. Krabs is horrified by this, and as a result, he destroys SpongeBob's television with a bat. He then explains to SpongeBob about his concern that this will happen to his house when he demonstrated it around SpongeBob's house and sends SpongeBob to spy on Pearl and her friends (despite telling her earlier no boys are allowed at the party) who had an idea with some disguise. Meanwhile, a teenage female sponge named Girly Teengirl from Farawayville who looks like SpongeBob arrives at Mr. Krabs and Pearl's house, asking to get in for the party. However, Pearl thinks she is SpongeBob, and she and her friends attack the girl, who runs home crying. At the time, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob arrives and pretend to be pizza deliverers while SpongeBob calls Girly Teengirl ugly.Unfortunately, SpongeBob is caught during the scuffle after his mustache flew away and is accidentally left behind as Mr. Krabs flees as he gets captured in process. As a result, SpongeBob had been turned into a pizza by the girls and sent back to Mr. Krabs, telling him that he failed the plan while Mr. Krabs eats some slice of it.SpongeBob later sneaks back in as a piano repairman, but Pearl and her friends already know his tricks and drop a piano on him. SpongeBob leaves and tries to tell Mr. Krabs to not spy on her again since they seem trustworthy, but Mr. Krabs demands that if he does not go to Pearl's party, then he is fired. Upset, SpongeBob goes back to Mr. Krabs' house and begs Pearl to stay at her party. Pearl is convinced, but he falls into Krabs' root beer cellar while trying to prove in ten seconds that he is fun enough for the party.SpongeBob absorbs all of Mr. Krabs' root beer to prove that he can be fun, while in hindsight ruining Mr. Krabs' house and putting Pearl and her friends in peril. Mr. Krabs arrives at his destroyed house, and he blames Pearl for its destruction and trusting her. Pearl is enraged at Mr. Krabs for blaming her and sending SpongeBob to spy on her and her friends (who are traumatized by this incident) and claims that Mr. Krabs is the only one at fault for ruining the party and its going to cost him some money.As punishment for ruining her slumber party, Pearl makes her father give up all his savings and uses it to host a private and really expensive beach party at Goo Lagoon, where Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are the only ones not allowed entry. The episode ends with SpongeBob offering a cup of root beer to Mr. Krabs to cheer him up, which does not help at all."

   "[Mr. Krabs reclines in his chair in a white tank top and underwear, fast asleep. Pearl walks up to him angrily.] Pearl: [yells] Unacceptable! [as she yells, she causes an earthquake that startles Mr. Krabs, waking him up] Mr. Krabs: [shocked and mad at Pearl for making the earthquake with her yelling] Pearl?! Pearl: My friends will be here in twenty minutes for my slumber party, and you're laying around in your tighty-no-longer-whities. Mr. Krabs: A man works hard all week to keep his pants off all weekend! Pearl: If you trusted me, you would leave for the night. Mr. Krabs: [laughs, causing corn chips to come out of his nose] You make Corn Crunch come out me nose! Pearl: Dad? Mr. Krabs: [gets out of his chair] Look, I'll stay upstairs in me room and not interrupt. Pearl: You promise? Mr. Krabs: I promise. Pearl: Good night, daddy. [giggles] Mr. Krabs: Good night, sweetie. [goes upstairs. Pearl walks to the refrigerator, and finds Mr. Krabs chaining it up] Pearl: Dad! Mr. Krabs: Oh, hi, pumpkin. I was just setting out refreshments for you and your friends. [hands her a tray with crackers and a glass of water on it] Pearl: Crackers and tap water? You are the cheapest crab alive! Mr. Krabs: Now, don't say that. [holds up a wallet full of cash] Here, would your friends like some pizza? Pearl: Well, yeah. Yeah, we would. Mr. Krabs: Okay, you can have your allowance early. [pulls some ketchup packets out of the wallet] Pearl: Ketchup?! Mr. Krabs: See, you put it on the crackers... [does so] and a mamma mia, you got-a one-a spicy pizza pie-a! [eats some of it; Pearl grabs him furiously] Mr. Krabs: Okay, okay, I'm going. [Pearl flings him into his room. Suddenly, she hears knocking from outside] Pearl: Oh! Oh! [laughs] They're here! [rushes outside] Hi! [finds Mr. Krabs nailing a large sign to the front of the house] Dad? Mr. Krabs: Just putting up the house rules. Pearl: [reading from the sign] No dancing... no loud music after 7:30... no touching the root beer cellar?! Mr. Krabs: And the most important one of all... [pulls a switch that activates a large neon sign reading \"NO BOYS ALLOWED\"] No boys allowed! Isn't it glorious? [Pearl leaves and locks the door on him; he tugs on the door handle] Sweetie? You accidentally locked the door. Pearl: You're not coming back in this house until after my slumber party is over! Mr. Krabs: [gasps] This is mutiny! Pearl: What are you gonna do about it? Take away my allowance? [throws the crackers with ketchup at him] Here you go! Mr. Krabs: Open this door or I'll... [The neon sign shorts out, along with all the other lights in Bikini Bottom. We hear clamoring from the citizens. Cut to SpongeBob's house, where Mr. Krabs is talking to SpongeBob.] SpongeBob: You wanna stay here? At my house? With me? [looks excited] Mr. Krabs: What do you say, boy? SpongeBob: [jumps into the air in exhilaration] Yee-hee! Slumber party! Mr. Krabs: Maybe I should just sleep under the highway. [Cut to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob sitting near the TV in sleeping bags.] SpongeBob: We can stay up really, really late! [shines a flashlight on his face] And tell ghost stories! [shows Mr. Krabs his socks] And trade socks! Mr. Krabs: Is that what girls do at slumber parties? SpongeBob: No. They invite boys over and destroy the house! Mr. Krabs: They what?! SpongeBob: You know how girls are. Mr. Krabs: Uh, SpongeBob, do you know anything about girls? SpongeBob: [laughs] Do I know any... no. But Gary does. [we see Gary reading a magazine, sitting next to the remote] Gary: Meow. [turns on the TV] TV Announcer: We now return to tonight's scary movie: \"Slumber Party Zombie Attack.\" [the movie features a group of girls having a pillow fight] TV Girl: Pillow fight! [the girls giggle] That tickles! [someone throws a pillow at some furniture and breaks it] Missed me! Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Look what they're doing to that man's house! SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, it's only a mov... Mr. Krabs: [silences him] Quiet, boy! TV Girl: Boys are here! TV Boy #1: [walks in with two other boys flanking him] Hi, girls. I brought my destructive friends. TV Boy #2: Nice to... [breaks a model boat with a crowbar] meet you! TV Boy #1: Ha! Destroying other people's possessions is fun! [the boys break a lamp, some tupperware and a piggy bank, and then set fire to the money inside. This frightens Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs: [shrieks] Turn it off! Turn it off! I can't take it! [hides in his sleeping bag and cowers in fear] SpongeBob: I don't think this is the scary part yet. Mr. Krabs: I said turn it off! [destroys the TV with a baseball bat] SpongeBob: Gosh, Mr. Krabs. I never knew you were scared of zombies. Mr. Krabs: Not zombies, you barnacle brain! Teenagers. SpongeBob: Zombie teenagers? Mr. Krabs: No! Pearl and her no-good friends! They're probably destroying me house right now! Like this. [knocks over a potted plant] Oops! I don't care, it's not mine. [picks up SpongeBob's family picture] Oh, look! One of the homeowner's most prized possessions! [throws it over his shoulder] La-dee-da... SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs... Mr. Krabs: [goes over to the bookshelf] Ooh, this'll be fun to destroy! [knocks the shelf over and it crushes SpongeBob] Whee! [SpongeBob's head pops out of the bookshelf] Now do you get it, boy? SpongeBob: Oh, I do, Mr. Krabs. It must be horrible to invite people into your home and have them treat your property with so little respect! Mr. Krabs: That's what teenagers do! Do you want this to happen to my house? SpongeBob: Gosh, no, Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs: [lifts him up by his head] Then get into Pearl's party and find out what they're doing! SpongeBob: Leave it to me, Mr. K. I've got the perfect disguise. [Cut to Pearl's room, where Pearl and her friends are reading magazines and laughing. There is a knock at the door. Pearl answers it.] Pearl: Hello? [a female sponge is there with her suitcase] Girly Teengirl: Hi, I'm here for the slumber party. Pearl: Do I know you? Girly Teengirl: My name is... um... Girly Teengirl. Pearl: [suspiciously] Uh-huh. Girly Teengirl: Um, I just moved here from... um... Farawayville. Pearl: I know it's you, SpongeBob SquarePants! Girly Teengirl: I don't know what you're talking about. [Pearl grabs her by the hair and lifts her up; Girly screams] Pearl: You were sent to spy on me by my dad! Get him, girls! [Girly screams again. Cut to Girly running away in tears while the girls throw food at her.] Girly: [crying] I am so moving back to Farawayville! [the real SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs drive up in a pizza delivery truck after Girly leaves] Mr. Krabs: Who the heck is that? SpongeBob: I don't know, but she is ug-ly! Now to put on that disguise I told you about. [puts on a fake mustache] Ta-dah! Huh? Huh? Huh? Mr. Krabs: You are one of a kind, boy. [SpongeBob knocks on the door of Mr. Krabs' house, holding a pizza box] SpongeBob: Pizza delivery. Pearl: We didn't order any pizza! SpongeBob: Y-You didn't? Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, tell them it's from me! SpongeBob: Your dad sent it. It's already paid for. Pearl: [opens the door] I'd sooner believe space aliens sent me a free pizza before I'd believe my dad would! Now, who are you? SpongeBob: Um... uh... [his mustache flies away, singing like a bird] Hey! Pearl: SpongeBob?! SpongeBob: They're on to us, Mr. Krabs! Drive! Mr. Krabs: Right, boy! [SpongeBob makes a dash for the truck, but Mr. Krabs drives off without him] SpongeBob: I wanted to come with you, Mr. Krabs. [the girls grab him] Pearl: Get him! [SpongeBob screams as the girls pull him inside and he drops the pizza box, showing that there is no pizza inside] Pearl: Oh, big surprise. Dad was too cheap to buy real pizza! [Cut back to SpongeBob's house, Mr. Krabs is digging through a trunk in his bedroom.] Mr. Krabs: What's taking SpongeBob so long? I'm getting tired of looking through his stuff. [there is a knock at the door; he answers it] Hello? [sees the pizza box] Pizza! [opens it, only to find SpongeBob in the shape of a pizza] SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I failed you. Mr. Krabs: I know, son. [takes a slice of SpongeBob] SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, that's my eye! Mr. Krabs: [bites the slice, then spits it out] And it's ice cold, too. You should have been back here in 30 minutes or less! [takes another slice. At Mr. Krabs and Pearl's house, the girls are playing a board game. There's a knock on the door] Pearl: Who is it? SpongeBob: [disguised] Piano repair man! [the girls are giggling] Pearl: Okay! We'll be right out! SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, it's working! [Pearl and her friends drop the piano on him from the roof] Pearl: Have it back by tomorrow. Okay? SpongeBob: [squashed] Maybe we should leave them alone, Mr. Krabs. They seem pretty trustworthy. Mr. Krabs: You get into that party, or you're fired! SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs. [there is another knock on the door of Pearl and Mr. Krabs' house] Pearl: Whoever could it be this time? SpongeBob: It's me, SpongeBob SquarePants. Can we talk, Pearl? Whale to sponge? Pearl: [to her friends on the roof] Hold the boiling oil! [her friends groan] What do you want, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: [crying] Oh, please let me stay at your party! Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please! Pearl: No! SpongeBob: Give me one good reason why I can't stay! Pearl: I can give you a hundred million billion reasons! SpongeBob: Yeesh, I only asked for one. Pearl: Reason number one: you're just like my dad! SpongeBob: Really?! Pearl: A no-good, dried-up, old fuddy-duddy! [SpongeBob's face dries up] SpongeBob: [his face pops back to normal] So if I prove I'm fun, can I stay? Pearl: Sure, SpongeBob. If you can prove you're the most fun person on the planet in the next ten seconds, you could stay. SpongeBob: I only need eight! [runs inside] SpongeBob: Whoo! Party! [cranks up the record player] Crank it up! Pearl: Five seconds. SpongeBob: These old newspapers are confetti in fun hands! Whoo! Girl 1: I'm allergic to newsprint! [starts blotching] Oh, ow! Pearl: Two seconds! [opens up a trap door to Mr. Krabs' root beer cellar. SpongeBob falls inside] Okay, okay, I got to admit. That was kinda fun. Girl 2: I think he's hurt. Pearl: He's not hurt. [SpongeBob groans] See? Girl 2: Maybe he's a zombie! Girl 1: If he comes back as a zombie and eats my brain, I'm totally not going to be your friend anymore! [Pearl closes the trap door] SpongeBob: [recovers] Ooh, Mr. Krabs' root beer cellar. Fun! [opens all the root beer kegs which fills up the cellar. He then absorbs it all. Upstairs, the girls are watching the same movie that he and Mr. Krabs were watching] TV Announcer: We now return to Slumber Party Zombie Attack! Girl on TV: [screams] A zombie! [a slimy, ugly thing appears on screen] Pearl: This movie isn't all that scary! Girl 1: Yeah, that zombie looks totally fake! [the trap door creaks open, and the girls look. SpongeBob emerges enormous and dripping with root beer, similar to the one on TV] SpongeBob: [gurgling] Fun! Party! Girls: [screams] Zombie! SpongeBob: Fun! [squirts root beer out of his body] Girl 3: [screams and gets soaked by root beer and falls down] Girl 4: Zombie juice! [gets blasted and falls down] Girl 5: [screams] Run! Pearl: [screams as she narrowly avoids a root beer blast, which soaks some knick-knacks. Root beer starts pouring out of the windows with random girls sliding out] SpongeBob: [gurgling] Who wants to dance? Girl 6: No! I already have a zombie boyfriend! SpongeBob: Let's boogie! Whoo! [starts spinning two girls in circles and get thrown out of windows. The house keeps spewing more soda and eventually breaks the door down. The spewing stops as Mr. Krabs pops onto the scene] Mr. Krabs: What in Neptune's toupee is going on here? [gasps and screams] Me knick-knacks! [screams] Me root beer! [walks past Pearl] Me pile of old newspapers! [crying] I was maybe gonna read that someday! [to Pearl] I knew I shouldn't have trusted you! Pearl: Trusted me?! Your employee destroyed this house! [picks up SpongeBob from inside the record player] The only boy at the party! Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?! SpongeBob: [normal voice] Well, Mr. Krabs, you know how boys are. [Pearl drops him] Ow! Pearl: [to Mr. Krabs] It's your fault my party is ruined, and all my friends have zombie shock syndrome! Girl 6: [rocking back and forth] I'm too pretty to be a zombie! Pearl: We were fine with a nice simple slumber party. But now, it's gonna cost you! Mr. Krabs: Cost me what?! Pearl: [sinister hiss] Money! Mr. Krabs: Noo...! [the scene cuts to outside of his house while Mr. Krabs' screaming causes the ground to shake, then bubble transition to Goo Lagoon] [At Goo Lagoon, a party is being held by Pearl. There are many people there.] Pearl: Everyone having a good time? [crowd cheering] Well, you can all thank my dad for making this possible! Thank you, Daddy! [Mr. Krabs is far away behind a velvet rope. A boss hog is watching him] Mr. Krabs: You're welcome, sweetie! [leaning on a rope] Oh, this is so expensive! Boss Hog: You're not allowed any closer, sir. [SpongeBob appears] SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I think I know what'll cheer you up. [puts a drinking glass under his armpit and squirts some root beer into it] A mug of ice cold root beer! Mr. Krabs: No, SpongeBob, that doesn't cheer me up at all!"

  "synopsis": [
   "Patchy the Pirate is holding a TV Extravaganza and is waiting for SpongeBob to show up to it, but with no reply, he thinks back to all of the time that has passed without SpongeBob giving him a reply. He then sets out to find SpongeBob, and rides his boat to Bikini Atoll.The animated section of the episode then begins with SpongeBob waking up in the morning with the help of many alarm clocks lined up to the foghorn clock, only to blow out more clocks, thus waking SpongeBob up. He then reveals that it is the eleventy-seventh year anniversary since Mr. Krabs officially opened the Krusty Krab. He then remembered the first time he ate a Krabby Patty, and he apparently loved it, even though he was not born yet when he had it. He prepares himself by getting ready in various wacky ways. While we see SpongeBob's getting ready process, the song \"A Day Like This\" can be heard. After he finishes getting ready, SpongeBob rushes all the way to the Krusty Krab when he bumps into the customers waiting in line to get into the restaurant, and he knows that he cannot be late for this, so he jumps over the crowd's heads.As the act ends, SpongeBob arrives at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs reminds them to keep a close eye on all of the doors, and entrances, including the air vents, to make sure that Plankton does not sneak in during the eleventy-seventh year anniversary celebration. Meanwhile, at the Chum Bucket, Plankton spoke with his computer wife, Karen, about how he has been a failure for 50 years of business, while Mr. Krabs has been nothing but successful. In order to redeem himself and finally get his hands on the Krabby Patty secret formula, Plankton decides that he'll sneak into the Krusty Krab while the employees and Mr. Krabs are distracted by the festivities, and steal the formula.Back at the live action segments, after Patchy ran off, P!nk and many other celebrities are sat down waiting around for their turn to perform in the extravaganza as promised. P!nk and her band decided it would be a good idea to practice their performance while they wait. They then begin to play the song titled \"We've Got Scurvy\" to open Act 2.Returning to Bikini Bottom, Mr. Krabs decides to put SpongeBob in charge of decorating the Krusty Krab. Squidward reminds Mr. Krabs what had happened the other time SpongeBob got to decorate (which then cuts to a flashback of SpongeBob's former decorating failure), but this time he was going to use the resources that he already had in the restaurant including napkins, ketchup, mustard, and inflatable Krabby Patties as balloons. Meanwhile, Patrick had been hired by Mr. Krabs as security. They then went to the freezer to see the ice sculpture SpongeBob had made for the Krabby Patty. After entering the freezer, the door accidentally gets locked behind them, thus trapping them. The four of them decide to bust into the air ducts in an effort to escape.While in the air ducts, Mr. Krabs finds a wrapper from an older Patty. Mr. Krabs then had a flashback of an old black and white Krusty Krab commercial. SpongeBob and the gang then go into the Krusty Krab surveillance room. On many monitors, they see that SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward's houses were on camera. Mr. Krabs acts as though he doesn't know why there are hidden cameras, although it is heavily referred that he is responsible for them. At that very moment, it's revealed that there are two men recording them from behind as they appear on one of the monitors. Mr. Krabs then suggests that they split up to find a way out. Mr. Krabs goes it alone while the other three stick together. Ultimately they just end up all together again a few moments later. Meanwhile, Plankton had reached the Krusty Krab and was searching through the air ducts to find a way to the formula, but he was having no such luck. Plankton eventually falls right into the duct the gang is in as Act 2 ends there.Act 3 starts off back on the surface, where Patchy sails through the sewers and on to the ocean. After sailing for a while he almost makes it to Bikini Bottom but is stopped short and eaten by a whale.Back with the gang, SpongeBob remembers the time that Mr. Krabs had first told him the formula. Plankton leans in, in an attempt to find out what the formula is but the Mr. Krabs in the flashback grabs Plankton and throws him down an air duct. After moving further through the air ducts, Squidward remembers the days before SpongeBob lived in Bikini Bottom, but SpongeBob interrupts him to remind him how great it was when he first moved in. Mr. Krabs' wallet then begins going crazy over all of the loose change he isn't earning from the customers waiting in line outside, so Mr. Krabs lets the wallet go so it can get to the money, only to be picked up by an unsuspecting man. Patrick then pulls out a radio transmitter he had taken from Sandy. They then attempt to call Sandy and have her come rescue them but Patrick destroys the transmitter after he thinks that Sandy is trapped inside it. As SpongeBob then remembers the time that he and Sandy got married through a flash-back, only for it to be revealed that the whole thing was just a play.Act 4 opens up by showing Patchy, now stuck in the belly of a whale, where he plays some supposed scenes of SpongeBob before it had first aired, including the Squidward, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs theme songs. His camera suddenly goes haywire which results in the whale sneezing him out, and launching him right back into the studio. He is knocked unconscious and starts dreaming that he is in Bikini Bottom by SpongeBob's Pineapple where he meets the titular sponge himself. He was then knocked out again, this time in his dream. He then wakes up to see the celebrities in the studio who tell him he can see SpongeBob everywhere, and they proceed to knock him unconscious once again (but in a rather fascinated way).Returning to the gang, at this point, SpongeBob had decided to use all of the gang as a battering ram to break through the air duct. After several tries the gang bust through only to discover that all of the customers were gone due to them waiting too long without getting any food. Mr. Krabs becomes heartbroken and believes the anniversary to be ruined, however, SpongeBob begins to sing the Krusty Krab song, \"Oh, Krusty Krab,\" which brings all of the customers back as they form a circle and start singing with SpongeBob. The Krusty Krab then returns to business and the celebration is ready to begin.Mr. Krabs also goes after the customer who had taken his wallet. Meanwhile, Plankton, on the other hand, was discovered by Mr. Krabs and was blown into a balloon after he pleads with him not to launch him. Mr. Krabs then holds the door open for a customer who turns out to be the same one who took his wallet. He then chases after the person after realizing this. SpongeBob wishes the restaurant a happy eleventy-seventh anniversary to finish off the special."

   "[A stop-motion intro is played.] [The episode begins with a clip of Patchy entering a random house after being shot out of a cannon from \"Shanghaied.\" It is surrounded by a picture frame that it surrounded by a red background.] Ricky Gervais: [As a voice over] 10 years ago, an unknown [The clip is replaced by a clip of Patchy laughing in Party Pooper Pants.\"] pirate from Encino began a [The clip is replaced with a clip of Patchy removing the SpongeBob items off his bed from \"The Sponge Who Could Fly.\"] decade-long obsession [The clip is replaced with a clip of Patchy in his one man band from \"Party Pooper Pants.\"] with TV's most beloved [The clip is replaced by a clip of Patchy putting the SpongeBob cookie ornament on his Christmas tree from \"Christmas Who?\"] an absorbent sponge.

[The clip is replaced with a clip of Patchy seeing the stick of dynamite and it going off from \"Party Pooper Pants.\"] Let's see what happens, yeah. [The clip shows Patchy burned after the explosion in \"Shanghaied.\"] [The screen fades to black. The scene opens up to the front of Nickelodeon Animation Studios, where Patchy's mom's car is pulling up. The scene changes to show the left of the car. Patchy gets out.] Patchy the Pirate: Oh. Bye, Mom. Thanks for the lift. [The car drives off, leaving smoke behind. Patchy coughs a bit.] Hey, kids. Isn't this exciting? I'm here at Nickelodeon, home of SpongeBob SquarePants, and I'm gonna ask him if he'll be my guest of honor on my tenth fan-iversary TV special! [Patchy chuckles. An image of the special's title appears. It reads, \"Patchy the Pirate's SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club Big Time Celebratory Television Extravaganza!\" Photos of Patchy and Potty are shown in elaborate borders. Their names are written below the pictures. The scene returns to Patchy.] Come on. [Patchy waves indicating to come that way. He walks to the gate. The scene shifts to show a speaker communicator. Patchy's hook is shown pressing it] Ahoy. [The scene shifts to show Patchy hunched over next to the speaker.] Security Guard: [through the speaker] Sir, may I help you? Patchy: Yes. This is Patchy the Pirate for SpongeBob SquarePants. I believe he's expecting me. I sent him over 400 letters...this week. Security Guard: Uh, yes. SpongeBob is not here right now, sir. Patchy: That's okay. I can wait. [Patchy takes out a lawn chair and sits down. The down to the gate opens and this startles Patchy.] Oh, SpongeBob! Security Guard: Sir, please step away from the gate. Patchy: Aw, poopdeck. I was hoping I could ask SpongeBob to phone up some of his famous friends so he could ask them to be guests on my show. Security Guard: Uh-huh. [The security guard starts to leave, but then realizes who Patchy is.] Oh. You're here for the Casting Department. Patchy: Yeah. Security Guard: In that case, please step right inside, sir. [Patchy thrusts his arm and mouths the word, \"yes.\" Patchy follows the security guard inside. Inside, Patchy and the security guard walk down a hallway where a cardboard cutout of SpongeBob and a model of SpongeBob made out of Lego bricks are seen. Patchy jumps up in the air and laughs. He returns to the ground.] Patchy: Woo! Oh, hey, when'll SpongeBob be here? Where's he? At lunch? At an important meeting? Security Guard: I'm not sure, sir. Patchy: Getting his boat waxed? Security Guard: [Pointing ahead] This way, sir. [The two continue to walk] Patchy: What's he really like? Security Guard: [Pointing ahead] This way, sir. Patchy: Does he come in everyday? Security Guard: [Pointing ahead] Go this way. Patchy: Does he dye his hair? Security Guard: [Pointing ahead] Walk this way, sir. Patchy: Huh? [The scene shifts to show a room. It has a couch, a TV, a poster for The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie , and an animation cell of SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab. The security guard opens the door. Patchy walks in.] Security Guard: Here you are, sir. Please wait here while you wait. [Patchy sits down on the couch.] Can I get you anything, sir? Patchy: Yeah. A shrimp cocktail. [Patchy chuckles. The security guard puts his hand out and then back in with a shrimp cocktail. He gives it to Patchy.] Ooh! Now, that's what I call service... [The security guard smiles.] with a smile! [he smiles] [The security guard leaves. The SpongeBob part of the episode begins with the title card. The episode begins showing the three houses of Conch Street at night. The scene transitions to morning. The scene changes to SpongeBob's room, where Gary's shell shaking with a blanket on top of it. Next to the shell is an traditional alarm clock.] Gary: [In his shell] Meow. [The alarm clock goes off.] Meow. [Gary's eyes pop out of his shell.] Meow. [A long line of alarm clocks go off, which leads from Gary, who is in the front of the bed to SpongeBob's normal alarm clock. It goes off and spits out more alarm clocks. SpongeBob wakes up. SpongeBob gets out of bed and turns the alarm clocks off.] SpongeBob: Good morning, Gary! Gary: [angrily] Meow! SpongeBob: A little overboard? And take a chance at being late for the single most greatest day of my career. [The shot widens and a thought bubble appears. It shows the Krusty Krab.] The eleventy-seventh anniversary of the Krusty Krab. [SpongeBob leans near Gary and shakes his head.] Oh, oh, oh, I think not. [He returns to his previous position.] No self-respecting Krusty Krab employee would be late on this day. [The scene changes to show the exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple, where SpongeBob's door open and a line of alarm clocks are leading to the inside of Squidward's house. The scene follows the alarm clocks to Squidward's door and then moves up. Squidward is heard muttering.] Squidward: [Off-Screen] What the? [The scene returns to SpongeBob's room. He is yelling out of his window.] See you at the big event, Squidward! [SpongeBob gets hit with an alarm clock. This causes him to fly and land next to Gary. SpongeBob gets up.] Can you believe that it's been eleventy-seven years already? Gary: [snidely] Meow reow reow. SpongeBob: Oh, watch the potty mouth, Gare. Today is a day for gentle reflection. Aw, I remember my first visit to the Krusty Krab. [A flashback begins. It shows the exterior of the Krusty Krab. Harold and Margaret SquarePants are walking to it. The scene shifts to show Harold and Margaret's front.] Harold SquarePants: I don't know. This doesn't look like a family restaurant. Margaret SquarePants: Oh. [The scene widens to reveal that she is pregnant with Baby SpongeBob] Well, what do you think, baby? Would you like to eat here? [The scene moves to show the inside of Margaret's womb. Baby SpongeBob swims off-screen. The scene returns to show Margaret. She is moved inside to the front of the cash register boat.] Well, okay, then. [The scene returns to the womb and Baby SpongeBob is next to Margaret's belly button which looks like a window that he is looking out. Margaret's voice is echoing.] What would you like? [Baby SpongeBob looks out Margaret's belly button and sees the Galley Grub] Baby SpongeBob: Krabby Patty! [The scene changes to show Margaret and Harold sitting at a table eating Krabby Patties. In the womb, Baby SpongeBob is eating the Krabby Patties through the umbilical cord.] Yummy! [He takes the cord, rips it out, and sucks on the cord. The flashback ends and the real SpongeBob is shown laying on the ground being held up by his elbows.] Good times. [An alarm clock appears. SpongeBob jumps up and starts running in the air.] Oh, sorry, Gary, we can reminisce later. I gotta get ready. [SpongeBob runs off-screen and Gary hisses at the alarm clock. The alarm clock \"runs\" away. The scene changes to show SpongeBob with a towel around his waist in the bathroom. He turns on the shower and takes the towel off. The scene shows SpongeBob showering] SpongeBob: [Singing voice-over] \u266a I never thought that I would have a chance like this. What dreams exist as big as this one? [SpongeBob turns the water off. SpongeBob grows big. The tub falls to its side and SpongeBob uses his wringer.] If happiness are patties frying on a grill, [SpongeBob makes a flat SpongeBob that goes through a slot. The scene changes to show a room with SpongeBob's pants on two wires.] I'll have my fill upon each fresh bun. [The flat SpongeBob lands and folds on top of SpongeBob's pants. He takes his hairdryer and puts it in one of his holes. He blows himself up.] Here's a day that couldn't get much better. [SpongeBob's legs go through the leg holes.] It is the greatest that's ever been. [SpongeBob runs into another room with a set of drawers. He opens the top one. It is filled with cans. He takes one. It reads, \"Sock.\"] It's so cool, I ought to where a sweater [SpongeBob drinks the can.] just to hold on to that warm feelin'. [Socks start to form one top of SpongeBob's feet.] A miracle is something that you don't believe [SpongeBob runs into his library were there is a pile of shoes. While running, he picks up two and continues to run.] you will receive, and then it happens. [SpongeBob ends up in his bathroom. He takes off his face and opens a cabinet of faces where he finds and puts on an exited face.] This is what I have to call a miracle. My heart is full and toes are tappin'. [The scene moves into SpongeBob's mouth.] Here's a day that couldn't get much better. [SpongeBob is shown running on a round surface at night. It is revealed that the surface is the bun of a Krabby Patty, which is on a cloud. It moves upwards.] It is the greatest that's ever been. [The Krabby Patty stops and SpongeBob dives off.] It's so cool, I ought to where a sweater just to hold on to that warm feelin'. [SpongeBob lands on a patty that is on his grill.] Sure, I know it's gonna take a lot of work, [A spatula takes SpongeBob and it is revealed that SpongeBob is putting the patty on the other patty makings.] but here's the perk, [SpongeBob eats the patty and it falls into a flowery background] I think I must say, [The Krabby Patty decomposes into its part and the SpongeBob that landed on the patty falls out.] when you're doing something that you really love [The scene changes to show spatula flying through the air. SpongeBob lands on one. SpongeBob starts dancing.] and so proud of, then work is like play. [SpongeBob then controls the spatula.] Here's a day that couldn't get much better. It is the greatest that's ever been. [The spatula flings SpongeBob and he lands on an ice cube in a cup of soda.] It's so cool, I ought to where a sweater [A purple sweater falls on SpongeBob] just to hold on to that warm feelin'. \u266a [SpongeBob melts through the ice cube. He falls into the soda. He gets sucked up by a straw, which is being sucked up by SpongeBob. SpongeBob then jumps away. The scene fades to the Exterior of Nickelodeon Studios. The scene shows. Patchy at a desk. Next to Patchy there is a Rolodex. Patchy is finishing the shrimp cocktail.] Patchy: Security, more shrimp cocktail in casting, please. Thank you. [He throws away the end of the last shrimp piece on the tray. A figure that looks like Potty, but with a devil tail and horns appears.] Devil Potty: Look, Patchy, a Rolodex. Why, it's probably full of celebrity phone numbers. You don't need SpongeBob. You can call them yourself. Go on, have a look. Squawk. [Patchy leans into it. Another figure that looks like Potty, but this time with a halo and angel wings appears.] Angel Potty: That's private property, Patchy. If you get caught looking at it, we'll never get to meet SpongeBob. Patchy: Yeah, good point. Devil Potty: Don't listen to him. You want your TV show to have big-name guests, don't you? Patchy: Yeah. No. I mean... Devil Potty: Then do it. Angel Potty: Don't do it, Patchy. Devil Potty: Come on. Do it! Do it! Patchy: I shall. [He takes the Rolodex. The Potties leave.] Let's see, Dawson, Richard. Rosario. Rosario Dawson! She'll bring a little class to the show. [The scene changes to show Rosario Dawson in her home looking at a magazine. She gets a phone call.] Rosario Dawson: Hello? [The scene returns to Patchy. He has bad breath that is showing.] Patchy: Uh, hello, Rosario. [The scene returns to Rosario. Patchy's breath has gone through the phone.] Rosario Dawson: Oh, goodness. [The scene returns to Patchy.] Patchy: It's Patchy the Pirate, president of the SpongeBob [The scene returns to Rosario. She is holding her nose.] Patchy: [through the phone.] Fan Club. I'm throwing a little TV [The scene returns to Patchy.] Patchy: show-tacular, and I need a little celebrity wind in my sail, so to speak. [The scene returns to Rosario.] Rosario Dawson: Okay. You need a little mouthwash is what you need. [The scene returns to Patchy.] Patchy: I was wondering if you'd like to be my special guest. [The scene returns to Rosario. She groans.] Rosario Dawson: Are you going to be in the same city? [The scene returns to Patchy.] Patchy: Of course, silly. We'll be working closely together ALL day. [The scene returns to Rosario. She hangs up. She groans. The scene returns to Patchy. Patchy groans. He hangs up the phone.] Patchy: Well, back to the old Rolodex. Uh, Bo Derek. Bo Diddly. Eddie Deezen. Eddie Deezen? [Eddie Deezen walks into the room.] Eddie Deezen: Hey, when do we film? [The scene shows Patchy confused. The scene returns to the door. The security guard comes in.] Security Guard: This way, sir. [The security guard takes Eddie Deezen out of the room. Patchy sighs.] Patchy: Ooh. This will be good. [Patchy picks up the phone. The scene changes to show the house of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog. The scene shows him with another dog near the pool. He answers the phone] Triumph the Insulting Comic Dog: Yes? Patchy: Ahoy, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog. Triumph: I'm Busy. Hurry up. Patchy: This is Patchy the Pirate. Triumph: Oh. Don't give me that Patchy stuff. Come on, Depp, I know it's you. Drop the pirate thing. Patchy: You know, I do get that a lot, but seriously, it's not Johnny Depp. Triumph: Come on. Who is this? The pirate from the cereal box or the litter box? Patchy: The one from Encino! It's Patchy, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club. Triumph: Ooh, the president! Well, your mother must be so proud. [The scene returns to Patchy. He looks disgusted.] Triumph: Listen, Scratchy. Patchy: It's Patchy. Triumph: You know, Catchy, maybe you should consider wearing two eye patches. That way, you won't be able to see what's become of your life. Patchy: What?! Triumph: So, what are you tell me, what are you selling, besides your dignity and self-respect? Patchy: None of the above. I was wondering if you'd like to be a guest on the big TV special. That I am throwing for SpongeBob. Triumph: Sorry, Poop-Leg Pete. I'm a big star. I don't do basic cable. I'm on a major network, kind of. Patchy: It would sure mean a lot to be personally if you'd be on my show, Triumph. Triumph: Oh, it would mean a lot. Well, why didn't you say so? That changes everything. Patchy: Oh. Triumph: You know, I'd love to be on your show. I'd love it as much as I love pulling ticks off my butt. Patchy: Well, fine. Who needs you, you filthy mongrel? Triumph: Okay, Captain Loser. Send me a script. Patchy: Great! So, you'll be on my show? Triumph: Sure, of course. I'm sure that it's a great script. Three, two, one. For me to poop on! [Triumph hangs up the phone. The scene returns to Patchy.] Patchy: Oh, yeah, well, I'll have you know, you are not the biggest star to tell me that. Hello? Hello? [Patchy groans and hangs up the phone. The scene changes to black and then shows the exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple. He opens the door and starts to jog to the Krusty Krab. A crash is heard off-screen. The scene moves to the origin of the crash. SpongeBob is laying down behind a line of fish.] Harold: Hey, hey. Chill out, buddy. We all want to get into the Krusty Krab as much as you do. [The scene shows that the line goes all of the way to the Krusty Krab. The scene returns to SpongeBob. He looks at his watch.] SpongeBob: But I don't have time to wait in line. Sorry, but I can't be late today. [SpongeBob steps on people's head's to get to the Krusty Krab.] Harold: Oh! Mable-Monica: Ah! Isabelle Fish: Ooh! Sadie: What the? Frankie Billy: Hey! Fred: Ah! Tom: Eh! Shubie: Uh! SpongeBob: Sorry, everyone, but Mr. Krabs needs me. [More fish make annoyed noises. Once SpongeBob reaches the end, the scene changes to the interior of the Krusty Krab. The scene shows several fish waiting on the door. SpongeBob Squeezes himself through the cracked between the doors and the ground. He enters the Krusty Krab. He lands in the arms of Mr. Krabs.] Reporting for duty, sir. [SpongeBob salutes Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs puts SpongeBob down in a seat next to Squidward.] Mr. Krabs: Sit down, boy. SpongeBob: Happy eleventy-seventh, Squidward. Mr. Krabs: [Walking past the table] Today's a big a day for the Krusty Krab. [Mr, Krabs ends up at a button.] So I want yous to listen up. [He pushes the button. It causes a shield to go around the Krusty Krab.] It's a perfect opportunity for Plankton to try and steal the Krabby Patty formula. [Mr. Krabs pulls a lever that looks like a handle on a table. It causes a panel to open. The table goes down the panel and is replaced by a hologram table. It turns on a hologram of the Krusty Krab.] Squidward: Isn't that just the Krusty Krab? Mr. Krabs: No. It's a holographic projection of the Krusty Krab. I want you two to watch all the entrances. Squidward: You mean the front door and the back door? [Mr. Krabs pushes a button on the hologram table.] Mr. Krabs: Those are just the ones on the surface. [The hologram expands to show the duct work.] There is an entire network of tunnels and air ducts underground and I want all eyes on the look out! SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. [Eyes grow on SpongeBob, filling his holes.] Mr. Krabs: Right. Study the map, stay extra vigilant. Don't fall asleep on the job. That means you, Squidward. Squidward: What? I have never fallen asleep on duty. Mr. Krabs: Don't make me have a flashback. [A flashback begins. It shows Squidward sleeping at his station. Fred is on the other side of the Cash register. The scene changes to show SpongeBob opening the Krusty Krab broom closet to find Squidward sleeping. The scene changes to show a close shot of Frankie Billy about to eat a patty at the Krusty Krab. The shot widens to show Squidward sleeping on Frankie Billy's table. It also reveals that Frankie Billy is dining with Nancy. The scene changes to show a close shot of the sink in the Krusty Krab kitchen. Bubbles are coming out of the sink and Squidward's snoring is heard. The shot widens to show Squidward with his head in the sink. The scene changes to show SpongeBob in the potty and reading a newspaper. Squidward's snores are heard. SpongeBob looks into the stall next to his and sees Squidward holding a newspaper and sleeping. The flashback ends.] Squidward: All right, point taken. [Mr. Krabs turns off the hologram.] Mr. Krabs: And to help watch out for Plankton, I've hired some extra security. [A dark figure is shown in the corner. He walks into the light. It is revealed to be Patrick. He has an angry look on his face. He smacks his fist into his palm.] Squidward: [While Patrick is walking to them] You hired Patrick? Mr. Krabs: What, you expect me to spend money on a real security guard? You are my first line of defense, Patrick. So, look out for any suspiciorous characters. Patrick: [No longer having an angry face. Saluting.] Yes, sir. [Patrick surveys the area. He sees Squidward and pushes him to the wall] Who are you, and who are you working for?! [Mr. Krabs chuckles] Mr. Krabs: Plankton doesn't stand a chance. [The scene changes to show the exterior of the Chum Bucket. It has a banner on it that reads, \"Celebrating 50 years of failure.\" The scene pans in. As it pans in, the doors open and an image of the dining area is shown and it pans into that. The scene fades to a wide shot of the lab. Karen is show in her computer form and Plankton is show at his desk.] Plankton: [As it is still panning in] It's a conspiracy, I tell you! A thousand and three times I've almost had that recipe, and a thousand and three times I've been launched by that Krabs! He celebrates eleventy-seven years of success, [The scene changes to show a medium shot of Plankton at his desk.] I'm left with four score and forty fortnights of failure! [The scene changes to show a closer shot of Plankton. He tears up.] I give up, Karen. Krabs has won! Karen: [Off-Screen] Well, you'll never get the formula with that attitude. [On-Screen] Maybe a thousand and four will be your lucky number. Plankton: Oh, yeah? You try getting launched. Karen: Oh, right, the launchings. [Her face is replaced by a loading bar and the word \"accessing\" above it.] I've got them all on my hard drive. [The scene shows, on Karen's monitor, Mr. Krabs in a baseball uniform, exiting the Krusty Krab. The scene shifts to show just the scene. Mr. Krabs pushes Plankton into the air. Mr. Krabs does this with a glove that he is wearing. Mr. Krabs spits and then throws Plankton. Plankton hits the Chum Bucket. The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs' claw putting down a golf tee.

You know, like any great work of art, SpongeBob didn't just appear out of nowhere. He started out as a thought. [A drawing of a man with SpongeBob in his head is shown.] Then he evolved into [A painting of a caveman drawing SpongeBob in the sand in a dark cave appears.] a primitive rendering. And along the way, [Patchy is shown again.] to becoming the sponge we all know and love, [Images of realistic SpongeBob and other characters appear on paper briefly, floating down.] he went through many different changes... [Patchy is shown again.] and phases...and phanges. [A painting that mimics the evolution of man image is shown. It uses SpongeBob looking-creatures instead of human ancestors.] And change can be very painful. For instance, [Patchy is shown again.] did you know that SpongeBob was not the first choice to star in the show? [gasps] Hard to believe, I know.

The house runs, jumps, and then rolls to the Krusty Krab. The Krusty Krab is also alive. Its legs rise.] Hello, Krusty Krab! [SpongeBob looks down at his wiggly toes and notices that he is only in his underwear. He whistles. His dresser hears the whistle. The bottom drawer opens and SpongeBob's clothes run to him.

[The Guy on the Penny lifts his hat and a SpongeBob plush toy is shown, with SpongeBob's laughter heard] Patchy: [gasps in excitement] I knew it! SpongeBob! [Patchy passes out again, but in a rather fascinated way. The scene changes to show the crowd of fish outside of the Krusty Krab.] Crowd: We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! [The scene shows SpongeBob in the vent.] SpongeBob: And we didn't even get to celebrate the Krusty Krab's eleventy-seventh anniversary. We missed what could have been the greatest party ever!

I don't wanna give up. Patrick: Ooh, I know. Uh, let's just say are tearful farewells and solemn last words. Mr. Krabs: I didn't make any money. [Mr. Krabs sobs.] Squidward: I never made anyone sick with envy. [Squidward sobs.] Patrick: I didn't get to sleep in [He sobs.] this morning! SpongeBob: Guys, we can't give up now!

SpongeBob: I said, are you with me, people?! Crowd: Yeah! SpongeBob: In that case, let's get some Krabby Patties! [Inside the Krusty Krab, Plankton opens the kitchen door.] Plankton: There's no one here. The Krusty Krab is empty. I've won! [He runs off screen and comes back with the secret formula.] The Krabby formula is mine. [He runs with it.] It took eleventy-seven years, but I got it! [He stops.] Oh no. [SpongeBob, followed by the customers, runs in.] No! [He is kicked, causing him to fly away. He screams.

  "synopsis": [
   "The episode starts with SpongeBob waking up, excited to start his day. While walking, he stubs his toe and starts crying. Later while getting dressed, SpongeBob accidentally rips his favorite outfit with a hanger and cries again. While eating breakfast and listening to the radio, SpongeBob hears a sad song, and this makes him cry yet again. Next door, Squidward is becoming annoyed by SpongeBob's crying.At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is cooking a Krabby Patty when he is startled by Mr. Krabs, causing the patty to fall on the floor. SpongeBob cries as he throws the patty in the trash, lamenting how it isn't fair. Squidward becomes irritated by SpongeBob's wailing and yells, \"Krabby Patty nothing!\" when SpongeBob tries to explain what happened. SpongeBob begins crying again because Squidward yells at him, at which point Squidward gives up.Later that day, Squidward confronts SpongeBob over how he has cried 43 times today before 2:00 pm. SpongeBob is doubtful he has \"that many tears in his brain\" but Squidward pulls up a TV and plays a video montage he edited which shows the number of different times SpongeBob has cried over the years. After watching thousands of instances of his crying, SpongeBob realizes Squidward is right. He promises to stop, but Squidward rebukes his words and makes a bet with SpongeBob that he couldn't last until midnight without crying. After a call with Patrick over the phone over his opinion of not crying the rest of the day, SpongeBob agrees with Squidward and they set the wager: If SpongeBob cries even one tear before midnight, he has to do various chores for Squidward for a year; If he does not, Squidward has to sleep over at SpongeBob's house for a night. Squidward is bothered by SpongeBob's end of the bet and thinks to himself that SpongeBob could cry any minute now.After the bet is made, Squidward follows SpongeBob home; to ensure he does not sleep over with him, Squidward tries to cheat and make SpongeBob cry over things like a beautiful sunset, sad news stories, a sad song on the clarinet, and a saddening bedtime story.Amazingly, SpongeBob manages to hold in his tears until midnight, despite all of Squidward's best attempts, and after midnight, SpongeBob cries all over Bikini Bottom like crazy. With SpongeBob winning the bet over him, Squidward is forced to come over to SpongeBob's house for a sleepover, and the episode ends with Squidward crying hysterically and SpongeBob comforting him while watching TV."

   "[Inside his pineapple house, SpongeBob is laying in bed snoring. His foghorn alarm sounds and he immediately wakes up. He inhales deeply and sighs before opening his window curtains.] SpongeBob: Good morning, day! [walks to his closet, but accidentally stubs his toe] Ow! [falls over and looks at his swollen toe] ''[stiffled]'' I stubbed my toe! [cries profusely] I stubbed my toe! I was walking around and I stubbed my toe! [later, he walks into his closet and searches though a long line of identical SquarePants while humming. He picks one, but the wire hanger rips through the side] D'oh! That was my favorite shirt! [cries. Later, he appears at his breakfast table eating oatmeal while listening to the radio] Radio DJ: And that was \"Aja\" by Eely Dan. Next up is Lionel Fishy with his hit, \"Sad Song.\" [The sad song begins to play, and SpongeBob begins crying again.] SpongeBob: A \"So Sad\" song! Squidward: [inside his house, wearing a robe and towel, while holding a cup of tea and a croissant] That SpongeBob is such a crybaby. Lucky me, I get to work with him all day. [takes a bite out of his croissant while SpongeBob continues to cry from inside his house. Later, at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is flipping Krabby Patties while singing] Mr. Krabs: [enters abruptly, startling SpongeBob, who flips the patty into the air] SpongeBob, guess what? [the patty lands on the ground] Yeah, I'll come back later. [goes back into his office. SpongeBob sadly picks the patty up by his spatula and carries it to the trash can] SpongeBob: He was a good little Krabby Patty. [sniffles] I didn't know him well, but in the few short seconds between grill and floor I... [opens the trash can lid and begins crying] I came to love him! [the patty slowly slides off his spatula and into the trash can] It just isn't fair! [cries even louder, soaking and enraging Squidward from the counter window] Squidward: SpongeBob, will you stop crying?! SpongeBob: But the Krabby Patty fell on the floor and he\u2014 Squidward: Krabby Patty nothing! [SpongeBob tries to speak again, but he angrily interrupts him very loudly] Krabby Patty nothing! [pants heavily, then SpongeBob whimpers with tears] What now? SpongeBob: [stifled] You yelled at me! You yelled at me! [sobs even louder than before, continuing to soak Squidward with tears while Squidward gives himself a depressed look on his face, realizing yelling is only going to make matters worse. Bubble transition to them in the dining area with a chalkboard] Squidward: All right, look. So far today, and it's not even 2:00 yet, you have cried 43 times. SpongeBob: And you wrote that number on a chalkboard. Squidward: Yes! SpongeBob: Why? Squidward: [pauses for a second] I have no idea. SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, there's no way I cry that much. There's not that many tears in my brain. Squidward: Au contraire. [turns on a TV] SpongeBob: What's this? Squidward: It's a quick montage of flashbacks I've edited together that shows the hundreds of tears you have cried over the years. [The video begins to play, showing SpongeBob crying in the Krusty Krab, in a grocery store, at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, in Jellyfish Fields, in the bathroom, and more like near a bus stop for no reason, in a birthday party.] SpongeBob: [in the video] Boo! Hoo! Boohoo! Stop. It burns. French Narrator: Thousands of tears later... [SpongeBob continues to watch himself crying in the video.] SpongeBob: Wow, guess I do cry a lot. I promise I won't cry anymore. Squidward: Oh, nonsense! I bet you can't go the rest of the day without crying. SpongeBob: [realizes something] Excuse me a minute. [walks up to a rotary telephone and dials it. Patrick appears lazily sitting on his couch when his own phone rings] Patrick: [answers it] Star... residence. Patrick speaking. SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. Patrick: Hey, buddy! Is it 7:30 already? SpongeBob: No, I'm still at work. Patrick: How can I help you? SpongeBob: Do you think that I could go the rest of the day without crying? Patrick: [with a mouth full with popcorn] Well, of course you can. SpongeBob: Okay, great, thanks, Patrick. Patrick: Umm... sure. And did you remember to put that package outside where I told you? SpongeBob: Yeah, but I left it in a different spot. Just ask Gary, he knows where it is. Patrick: Oh, yeah. [laughs with his mouth full] Hey, good one, buddy. You almost had me there. SpongeBob: [chuckles] Okay. Patrick: Yeah, talk to you later. SpongeBob: All right, see ya. [hangs up, then walks back to Squidward] Okay, it's a bet! Squidward: [shakes SpongeBob's hand] Fine. If you cry one tear before midnight, you have to... [thinks] Wash my bike, clean out my rain gutters, and do all my yard work for a year. SpongeBob: Sounds fair to me. And if I make it to midnight without crying, you'll come to a slumber party at my place! Just you and me! [Squidward retches and swallows] Ooh, what's the matter? Squidward: Um, nothing, I just threw up a little in my mouth. [begins talking in his thoughts] No need to worry, Squiddy. You've outdone yourself. He'll be crying in ten minutes. [laughs out loud. In the evening, he and SpongeBob are now walking home from work] SpongeBob: Thanks again for walking home with me, Squidward. Squidward: There's a first time for everything. [under his breath] Also, I'd like to win this bet as soon as possible. [chuckles devilishly] SpongeBob: [hears this and starts speaking in his thoughts] I am not gonna cry. I am not gonna cry. [straining, he speaks out loud] I can do this! Squidward: [smiling] Do what? [sees something and gasps] Oh, my! What a lovely sunset. Take a look, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob looks at the sunset and gasps] Isn't that beautiful? SpongeBob: I've never seen such a beautiful underwater sunset. Squidward: Really tugs the heartstrings, doesn't it? SpongeBob: [gasps quietly in awe] It's... [the Bikini Bottom Choir drives by singing an angelic note. Squidward chuckles as SpongeBob's eyes begin to twinkle and water] Squidward: Is that a tear I see? [the sunset disappears, causing SpongeBob to snap out of it] SpongeBob: Oh, well, sunset's over. [walks off, and Squidward scoffs in frustration] [Later, they both enter SpongeBob's house.] SpongeBob: Nice of you to drop in, neighbor. Squidward: Nice of you to have me, I-- [sees something] Oh, look SpongeBob. Gary's sleeping. [Gary appears on a stack of newspapers sleeping, snoring and meowing.] SpongeBob: [with his hands together, up to his mouth] Aww. He looks like an angel. Squidward: That is just so adorable. Almost makes you want to cry. [Gary begins to drool in his sleep.] SpongeBob: Yeah... [snaps out of it] No! There shall be no tears in this house tonight! [walks off into the kitchen, singing a song] [The mail comes in through the mail slot in SpongeBob's door.] Squidward: Oh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: [pouring drinks] Yes? Squidward: Your mail's here. Ooh, oh look, it's a postcard from your dear mother and father so far away. SpongeBob: [turns around] Mother, father? Squidward: [reading the postcard] \"Dear SpongeBob, we are having a wonderful time in the South Seas and we miss you very, very much. SpongeBob: [teary-eyed at first] Oh... [grabs another postcard and snaps out of it] My subscription to Jellyfishing Monthly's expired. Remind me to renew that, will you, Squidward? Squidward: [with spite] No problem. [Later on, SpongeBob and Squidward sit on the couch watching the news.] Anchor Fish: Welcome back to Bikini Bottom News. Our top story tonight: a series of sad tales. Squidward: Ooh, let's turn it up. Anchor Fish: Tragedy in the park when a young snail caught in a tree almost didn't get down. Snail #13: [stuck on a coral tree branch] Meow. [SpongeBob gasps and gets ready to cry.] Anchor Fish: However, he did get down. SpongeBob: [happily while raising his arms] Hooray! Anchor Fish: Coming up, an interview with a manatee who didn't get what he wanted for his birthday. SpongeBob: [sad again] Oh, no. Anchor Fish: And finally, sad news for Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fans. [Squidward excitedly raises up the volume.] SpongeBob: [voice breaks] What, what, what? Anchor Fish: They will only be showing The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Show seven times a day instead of eight\u2014 SpongeBob: [sweats and changes the channel] Let's watch something else Squidward, okay?! Squidward: Fine! [The channel changes to a show where a dad fish is walking out of his house for work while a kid fish plays with a baseball in the yard.] Kid Fish: Hey, Dad, how about a game of catch? [throws the baseball in front of his bored dad] Unnamed father: Sorry, son, I'm late for work. Kid Fish: [disappointingly] Okay, Dad. [his dad throws the baseball back] Unnamed father: [tosses his briefcase] I guess I can stay for a few throws. Kid Fish: [teary-eyed] I love you, Dad. Unnamed father: [teary-eyed] I love you, son. [The show ends with the two happily playing catch. SpongeBob turns the TV off and madly throws it out of his window screaming in anger, then walks back to the couch panting.] SpongeBob: [to Squidward] You know what they say about that television. Rots the brain. Patrick: [from outside] Hey, thanks for the TV, SpongeBob! [carries the broken-up TV set on his head] I'm gonna watch it all night! [runs into his rock house with it. SpongeBob and Squidward awkwardly stare at each other, Squidward glances at the cuckoo clock, which says 8:41, then speaks in his thoughts] Squidward: It's getting late. I'd better bring out the big guns. [out loud] Oh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Yes, Squidward? Squidward: What would you say to a little music? [pulls out his clarinet] SpongeBob: [gasps happily] I'd say... I'll go get some refreshments. [walks off] Squidward: Don't be long. My secret weapon is waiting. [gets out sheet music titled \"Hearts & Flowers (or Some Such Sad Song),\" then chuckles] SpongeBob: [appears holding a tray of tea] You said something, Squidward? Squidward: Oh, I just said, \"Relax and enjoy the song.\" [begins playing the such sad song on his clarinet. SpongeBob goes stifled, trying to fight back tears. Squidward strains hard playing the last single note, then pants] SpongeBob: That's a really sad song, Squidward. Squidward: You're not gonna cry though, are you? SpongeBob: No. [Squidward growls. The scallop cuckoo clock then chirps 9:00] Time really does fly when you're having fun. Well, I'd better start getting ready for bed. [starts to put the tray of tea down] Squidward: [nervously] Uh, SpongeBob. No-no-no-no, wait. SpongeBob: Yes, Squidward? Squidward: How about a bedtime story? SpongeBob: Now you're talking! [later in his room, he lays in bed with Squidward] Whatcha gonna read me, Squidward? Squidward: Umm... [nervously searches through the pages] How 'bout The Little Angler Who Got Lost? SpongeBob: That sounds like a very sad story. Squidward: Oh, very sad. Umm... \"There once was a little angler [the page he's reading is actually of the story Jack and Jill] who was, uh, little and sad. [SpongeBob whimpers] One day the little sad angler was walking through the park. [SpongeBob begins to chuckle with joy] SpongeBob: Walking... Squidward: But, he was sad, because...because he was lost... he was lost and very sad. And then, he... he started to cry! [SpongeBob begins to choke up] He cried, and he cried, and he cried even more [SpongeBob strains and fights back the tears] And he kept crying and crying and crying and crying and... that's right. You can do it. SpongeBob: [struggling not to] I'm wondering if it might not be so healthy to hold in all my tears, Squidward. Squidward: You're exactly right, SpongeBob. Let it all out. Don't fight the feel... [the second hand on the clock ticks closer to midnight] Ten, nine... do it, do it, cry... eight, seven, six, five... come on! [SpongeBob strains. The dam inside his brain begins to crack] ...four, three, two, one! [the dam breaks, and a river of tears rushes out] Midnight! [sighs. SpongeBob's body is turning wide] Well, SpongeBob, it looks like you won the... [SpongeBob's eyes burst with tears, shooting a flood towards Squidward and smacking him against the wall. The tears shoot out the windows, door crack, chimney, and other holes in his house. They spread to Patrick's house, causing an entire waterfall inside.] Patrick: Wow, what a great show. [The tears flood the Krusty Krab.] Mr. Krabs: [standing on his desk, holding a fat stack of money away from the tears] Well, at least we're still together, little ones. [The Bikini Bottom Choir drives through the flood holding the angelic note. At SpongeBob's house, the tears continue to spray into Squidward's face, then stop. The cuckoo scallop hits him on the head. Now, SpongeBob and Squidward sit in front of the TV.] SpongeBob: [holds out a bowl of popcorn] More popcorn, Squidward? Squidward: No, no. No, no. Please. SpongeBob: [eating popcorn] Don't be shy now. I made extra. [Squidward sniffles and begins to whimper. SpongeBob holds his arms] That's all right, let it out. You can cry all you want. [rubs his right arm] You're among friends here. [Squidward whimpers even harder, then starts bawling hysterically.]"

  "synopsis": [
   "In the beginning of the episode, everybody gets special invitations from SpongeBob, promising each the thing they love most in life. For example, SpongeBob says to Mr. Krabs that he will have free money, says to Squidward that he will have a latte sipping contest, and says to Sandy that she will have a science experiment. Everyone goes to his house, only to be surprised and disappointed that they are going to see vacation slides, which they do not care about. They are about to leave, but SpongeBob persuades them back.The adventure starts with Patrick squirting the Cheese Fizz on the camera. SpongeBob's parents pull up and get him and Patrick in. SpongeBob looks at a brochure and Patrick suggests a game- Hide and Seek. Patrick gets on the windshield of the boat and Harold yells \"Egad!!!\"' and loses control. They slide and burst into The Outskirts Outlet Mega-Mall, and Basscar Racing Stadium. Then, they fling off the stadium and head straight into space where a floating cow gets hit by them and lands on the moon. Then, they fall back down to the Earth and slide down a rocky cliff onto the road. SpongeBob then suggests they sing a road song. Everyone sings the road song, and at the end of the song, the engine blows up. They move the boat to a local service station. They wait in an outhouse. Margaret sees a playground and offers SpongeBob and Patrick to play on it. They do, but they slide down a sewer pipe and onto a small puddle.When they get up, they try to get back up, but they cannot. They enter a mysterious red kelp forest with many mushrooms. They hear a hollering noise and run. It turns out it is a small creature. They jump over a cliff, onto an anemone and onto a mushroom. Behind Patrick is a giant fruit fly. They run away and go behind a rock. They hear a noise. It came from a gift shop. SpongeBob wastes his money on useless knick-knacks. They sing the road song wearily. Then, SpongeBob decides to play the road song on a flute he bought at the gift shop.They walk along past Harold and Margaret and into the forest again. Animals follow them. The animals suddenly run away because the giant fruit fly is behind them. SpongeBob stops playing. When they turn around, they see the fruit fly wants to give them a lift. They then sing the above the road song. He drops SpongeBob and Patrick off. SpongeBob's parents call them over, but SpongeBob and Patrick just fall asleep. Margaret says \"Do something Harold!\" while Harold says \"He's your son, Margaret, he's your son...\" As the episode ends."

   "[Mr. Krabs walks outside of his house, opens his mailbox, and then sticks his claw into it.] Mr. Krabs: [With his eyes closed] Please be money, please be money. [Pulls out postcard from mailbox.] Oh! That's not money. It's from SpongeBob. [Puts on his glasses, and reads the postcard] \"Dear Mr... Krabs, please come to my house tonight. I am having a free money party.\" Free money party!? This sounds too good to be true! [Cuts to scene to show Squidward by his mailbox] Squidward: [Reads postcard] \"Dear Squidward, come to my house tonight, I am having a... [surprised] ...latte sipping contest?\" This sounds too good to be true! [Cuts to inside of Sandy's treedome] Sandy: [Reading postcard] \"Please come by my house tonight. I'm having a science fair!\" Oh, SpongeBob, this sounds too good to be true! [Her science experiment fizzes] [Cuts to Larry lifting weights] Larry: [Reading postcard] \"I am having a weight lifting competition!?\" This sounds too good to be true! [Cuts to Mrs. Puff at boating school] Mrs. Puff: [Gasps as she reads postcard] \"A quiet evening studying the rules of the road!?\" [Laughs] Oh! Ahem... That sounds too good to be true. [Cuts to the inside of the Chum Bucket] Plankton: [Reading postcard] \"A meeting of the minds to discuss the ultimate downfall of the Krusty Krab!?\" This sounds too good to be true! [Cuts to Mr. Krabs knocking on SpongeBob's door] SpongeBob: [opens the door] Welcome, friends! Please come in! [Everyone walks inside] SpongeBob: I'm so glad you all could make it! Tonight is going to be a magical evening filled with... magic! Mr. Krabs: Eh... SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs: Can we skip the magic and get right to the free money? Squidward: How 'bout the latte sipping? Larry: And what about the pumping of the iron? Plankton: And diabolical conspiracies? Sandy: And let's not forget the science fair! SpongeBob: The real reason I called you here was to watch this slideshow of photos from my family vacation! Squidward, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, Mrs. Puff, Larry, and Pearl: I knew it was too good to be true! [Patrick then bursts through the crowd] Patrick: Ahaha! Ahaha! Sorry I'm late, SpongeBob! I had to find my movie watching hat! Plankton: That does it... I'm gone. [Plankton starts to leave, but the others exit, and Larry squishes him, followed by Pearl, Mrs. Puff, and Sandy, all stepping on him] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! You're going to miss the first slide! [Clicks button and sticks his tongue out] [A slide of Patrick appears on the screen next to the wall.] Squidward: Looks more like a slip than a slide. Ha ha! Mr. Krabs: I've seen enough. [They start leaving while Sandy is angry] SpongeBob: Wait! Come back! [Moves projector] See, it's Patrick! Patrick: Hey! It's me! Squidward: Why is it all orange and blurry? SpongeBob: Where? Squidward: See, right there on the entire thing! SpongeBob: Oh! That's because Patrick kept spraying the camera with Cheese Fizz! [Ripples to SpongeBob taking picture] SpongeBob: Patrick! You're spraying the camera with Cheese Fizz! The pictures will come out all orange and blurry. Patrick: I can't help it, SpongeBob! I'm so excited about going on a family vacation with you and your parents that my aim is off! [Patrick sprays himself in the eye with Cheese Fizz.] See? [Patrick blinks, squirting the Cheese Fizz into his mouth and then licks his lips.] There we go... SpongeBob: I know what you mean. Sometimes it feels like I've been waiting my entire life to go on this trip! Patrick: Really? Why is that? SpongeBob: Probably because I have. Patrick: Have what? SpongeBob: Been waiting. Patrick: [Breathing heavily] Wait... you mean so... What? [SpongeBob throws the camera behind him and then gasps] SpongeBob: Patrick! They're here! [SpongeBob's parents pull up in their station wagon. Harold pokes his head out of the window.] Harold: Good morning son, are you ready to head out? SpongeBob: You bet! Margaret: SpongeBob! Don't leave your luggage behind! [points to Patrick] SpongeBob: [laughs] That's not luggage, it's Patrick! He's coming with us, remember? Harold: Well, shake a leg, boys. The Great Barrier Reef isn't gonna visit itself! Margaret: Your father's right, son! Harold: [Muttering] They know I'm right... [Cuts to the family driving.] Patrick: [As SpongeBob pulls out a map] You brought homework? SpongeBob: No, Patrick, it's a brochure detailing all the fun we'll have at our final destination! [opens brochure] The Great Barrier Reef! See? there's a huge assortment of slides, and trampolines... Patrick: [Drooling] And forts... SpongeBob: And ropes to swing on... Patrick: [Still drooling] And forts. SpongeBob: And a water park! [Camera zooms out, pans to Patrick drooling on map.] Oh wait, that's just where you drooled on it. [Closes brochure] I can't wait to get there! How about you? Patrick: No, I can't. SpongeBob: [With his eyes closed] Yeah... Patrick: [Sweating] No, I mean I really can't. [Shouting] I've been in this confined space for too long, somebody help! [bangs on the car windows] Get me out of here! [Cuts to the car driving on the ride with Patrick silently banging on the window.] Harold: Alright, boys, alright, turn down the volume back there. Margaret: [Turns to face the backseat] I have an idea! Why don't we play a road game to pass the time? SpongeBob: Yeah! Maragaret: Anybody know any? Patrick: [Raises hand frantically] Oh! Oh! Oh! Hide and seek! [Patrick dives under the passenger seat.] SpongeBob: Hey, why does he get to go first? Harold: [Singing] \"And she threw it all away...\" Patrick: [Flies into windshield] Okay find me! Harold: Egad! [Car spins out of control, crashing into a sign for The Great Barrier Reef. The car crashes in the Outskirts Outlet Mega Mall, bouncing through. The car goes down the escalator, while a tan female fish looks over at the car, and doesn't seem to care. The car then crashes out of the mall, flying through the air, and landing on a race track.] Announcer: There's the green flag and the race is underway. [The car bounces off of a siren, and then circles the track. The car crosses the finish line, and wins the race.] And we have a new winner! [The crowd cheers, and the car crashes through the trophies, exiting the race. The car leaves the ocean, and flies into the air, eventually flying through space. The car hits the cow that jumped over the moon, and falls back down into the ocean. The car crashes between a multitude of rocks, before landing back on the road, and driving away with Patrick now inside.] SpongeBob: Maybe we should just sing the road song. Patrick: \u266aRoad! Road! Road! Road!\u266a [Continues for rest of song] SpongeBob: \u266aWhen I'm on the road, I see stuff going by. When I'm on the road,\u266a Patrick: \u266aI got a bug in my eye!\u266a SpongeBob: \u266aWhen I'm on the road,\u266a Margaret: \u266aLooks like clear skies ahead.\u266a SpongeBob: \u266aWhen I'm on the road,\u266a Harold: \u266aPlease stop touching my head.\u266a All: \u266aLet's all sing the road song!\u266a SpongeBob: \u266aI wanna sing it all day long!\u266a All: \u266aLet's all sing the road song! Let's all sing along!\u266a [Song ends abruptly when fire starts on top of car. Cuts to show car from the outside.] SpongeBob: Um... anybody know any other good road tunes? [Cut to the gang pushing the car, sans Patrick who thinks he is pushing the car, but is not pushing anything.] SpongeBob: How much farther to the nearest service station? Harold: Probably pretty far son. [Cuts to show road sign that shows that the nearest service station is \"Probably pretty far.\"] SpongeBob: Oh, you're right! [Gang continues to push car, cut to them at a service station.] Harold: So, uh, how's it lookin'? Service Station Worker: [Pointing to objects in car] Well, it's got a cracked timing case cover, you've broken a couple teeth off the timing gear, your radiator is damaged at the core, you got a cracked water pump, and a fractured injector line. Margaret: And what does all that mean? Service Station Worker: Well, little missy, in technical terms... if she don't wanna run, she don't wanna run! [Cuts to Margaret and Harold staring blankly.] Harold: Uh-huh. So what are we looking at time wise? Service Station Worker: Well, now, that depends... how much time ya got? [Service Station Worker starts laughing] Patrick: [Laughing] How much time ya- [All stare at Patrick] Not funny. [SpongeBob takes a picture.] SpongeBob: Hey at least they have a cozy-looking waiting room! [Points to outhouse.] Come on! [Cut to the gang in the outhouse. Harold is reading the paper and Margaret is knitting. SpongeBob and Patrick are waiting silently.] SpongeBob: Man, am I bored. Patrick: I am beyond bored. I am... be...yond. Margaret: [Looking out window] Oh boys! Is that a playground I see? [SpongeBob and Patrick stare blankly for a few moments before running to the playground, hollering \"Playground!\" They slow down upon noticing all the mud around the playground] Patrick: Not the most colorful playground I've seen. SpongeBob: Mm-mmm. This looks more like a grey-ground. Cuts to swings, slide, and see-saw. SpongeBob takes a picture. Margaret: Well I'll just let you two amuse yourselves and come back for you when the boat's fixed. SpongeBob: [Turns to Margaret] Actually this place seems a little bit- Margaret: Have fun! Patrick: Well, this is a nasty turn of events. SpongeBob: You're preaching to the choir, Patrick. Patrick: [Crosses arms] I knew it was gonna happen, too. SpongeBob: You did? How? Patrick: [Turns around to reveal Cheese Fizz spread across his shorts, reaches into pocket] Because it happens every time I keep my cheese fizz in my back pocket! [Sprays remaining cheese fizz into mouth before running out.] Darn! It's almost empty! SpongeBob: [Walking towards see-saw] Well, I guess we'll have to make the best of it. [Jumps onto see-saw while laughing.] This is fun! Hey Patrick, you- [SpongeBob's speech becomes incoherent as he sinks into the mud.] Patrick: [Spraying Cheese Fizz into mouth] Huh? [Patrick walks towards the mud that SpongeBob had sunk into.] SpongeBob, were you talking to me? [SpongeBob reaches his arms out of the mud] I could have sworn SpongeBob was calling me from this direction. SpongeBob, where are you?! [SpongeBob pulls himself out from the mud by grabbing onto Patrick. Patrick is now sitting on top of SpongeBob] SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. Patrick: Huh? SpongeBob? Oh come on, where are you hiding? This isn't funny! [Looking around] Huh. [Puts hands on hips] SpongeBob: [Pokes Patrick] Patrick, I'm right here. Patrick: [Looks at SpongeBob] Oh, hey SpongeBob! How'd ya get there? SpongeBob: Well, I was on this see-saw- Patrick: [Yelling] Slide! [Bounces off of SpongeBob and onto slide. Patrick laughs and attempts to go down slide, but gets stuck and has to force himself down. The slide gets stuck to his bottom. Patrick tries to pull the slide off, but fails. The slide hits Patrick, and he goes flying.] SpongeBob: Patrick, do you need help? Patrick: [Walks up to SpongeBob with side still stuck] Huh? With the slide stuck to my bottom? Nah, I want it there. [Patrick stands motionless for a second.] I hate you slide! [Pull slide off, flattening SpongeBob. SpongeBob sits motionless on the sand.] Oh, sorry SpongeBob. [Patrick pulls the slide off and throws it behind him] SpongeBob: [Wobbles back up] Hey look, a swingset! [Flops over to the swings, pulling himself back up] Can't go wrong with this old-time playground favorite. [SpongeBob swings on swing set.] Weee. Hey, this is almost like being at The Great Barrier Reef, huh? Try it, Patrick. Patrick: Okay. [Patrick sits motionless on swing.] It's not working. SpongeBob: [Swinging] Go back and forth like this. [Patrick starts swinging] There you go! Now you're getting into the... swing of things! [Laughing] Patrick: [Starts laughing] Hey, watch me go! [Patrick breaks the swing set and flies off, screaming] SpongeBob: Patrick? Patrick: [Rolls into fence, breaking it and starts falling down a slide] SpongeBob: Patrick! I'm coming! [SpongeBob and Patrick slide down the water slide, screaming, while going down multiple sharp turns. SpongeBob and Patrick end up in a puddle] SpongeBob: Patrick? Patrick: [Muffled] SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Patrick! Are you okay? Patrick: No, I'm not okay. SpongeBob: You're not? Patrick: No, I'm great! That was awesome! Let's do it again! SpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick, wait for me. [SpongeBob and Patrick climb up the slide, falls back down] SpongeBob: Something tells me that is a one-way drain. [Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick walking through a strange forest.] SpongeBob: [Groaning] How long have we been walking here, Patrick? Patrick: Well, that depends on who you ask. SpongeBob: Why? Patrick: Well, if you ask someone with a watch, they might be able to tell you. [Monster growling] SpongeBob: Are you getting hungry? Patrick: Yeah! How'd you know? SpongeBob: I could hear your stomach growling. For a second I thought it was some scary monster coming to eat us. [SpongeBob and Patrick laughing] Patrick: That's funny! Couldn't have been my stomach growling though. SpongeBob: It couldn't? Patrick: [Poking stomach] Nope. I had its vocal cords removed before the trip. SpongeBob: Well, I could've sworn that I heard- (Monster growling) Patrick: SpongeBob, I heard it! I heard growling! SpongeBob: No, that time it was my stomach. There's got to be something around here to eat. [Picks berry and puts it in mouth] Patrick, I found some berries we can- [SpongeBob inflates, body turns purple] not eat! Patrick: [Patrick eating] Thanks for the warning. SpongeBob: Patrick, where did you get [Pulls out needle, pops self] the kelp cake? Patrick: From the vending machine! [Camera pans to vending machine] SpongeBob: Oh. [Monster growling] Patrick: Was it your stomach that time too? SpongeBob: Nope. Run for your life! [SpongeBob and Patrick run] [Small creature appears, growls] SpongeBob: It's getting closer! [SpongeBob and Patrick almost fall of cliff] Oh no! It's a sheer drop-off! What do we do? Patrick: Don't ask me! I don't remember \"being eaten alive\" on this trip's itinerary. SpongeBob: I'm too young to be digested! [Jumps onto Patrick, crying] Patrick: Wait, SpongeBob! I know how to get us out of this! SpongeBob: You do? Patrick: I saw something like this in a movie once! Now watch closely, and do exactly what I do! SpongeBob: Roger! [SpongeBob and Patrick jump off of cliff] SpongeBob: Okay, now what? Patrick: Uh... I'm not sure, I fell asleep in the second half of the movie! [Both screaming] Patrick: Well, I hope that monster's carrying some syrup! SpongeBob: Yeah, cause if he's eating us, he's having pancakes for lunch! [SpongeBob and Patrick land on sea anemone, bounce off and land on plant. SpongeBob and Patrick laughing with heavy breath] SpongeBob: Patrick, we did it! Patrick: We're not gonna be eaten! SpongeBob: Hooray for not being eaten! Patrick: Hooray! [Laughing] SpongeBob & Patrick: We're not gonna be eaten! We're not gonna be eaten! Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick? Patrick: All this not being eaten is making me hungry. SpongeBob: Oh, don't worry. When we get to The Great Barrier Reef, we'll eat like kings! Patrick: Alright! SpongeBob: Alright! Now put 'er there, Patrick! Patrick: Put 'er there! SpongeBob: Ooh Patrick, have you been using a different moisturizer? Your hands feel kind of- [Screaming] [Monster appears behind Patrick] Patrick: Oh no, it's just the same old moisturizer I always use. [SpongeBob panicking] Patrick: Oh, come on, SpongeBob, don't leave me hanging here! [SpongeBob panicking] Patrick: Let me guess, it's time to start screaming again? SpongeBob: Wait a second. [Takes picture] Okay now. [Both screaming and running] [SpongeBob and Patrick fall, SpongeBob grabs onto a vine while Patrick grabs onto SpongeBob's legs] Patrick: SpongeBob, as much as I'd like to stay and hang around, I'm not sure now's the time. SpongeBob: I know Patrick, but now it seems to be- [Hands slip, SpongeBob starts hyperventilating] Our best possible course of action! Patrick: [Sweating] Well, I'd probably be really enjoying the view if I still had some blood flowing in my arms. Ow! [Vine starts to break] SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick, your blood flows not the only thing that's wearing thin! [Vine breaks, both screaming and swinging on a vine. SpongeBob sees different vine] Grab it, Patrick! Patrick: Grabbing! [SpongeBob gets sleepy] Okay SpongeBob, your turn! SpongeBob! SpongeBob: [Snoring, wakes up and grabs vine] Oh, I got it! [SpongeBob and Patrick slide through the sand, land behind a rock] [Monster looks around, shrugs and flies away] SpongeBob: Whew, that was a close one, right Patrick? Patrick: Yeah, but it looks like everything worked out just... fine... [Patrick laughing] [Ringing noise] SpongeBob: Patrick... Patrick, did you hear that? Patrick: It sounded like it came from the other side of this big rock! SpongeBob: This isn't a big rock, it's a big wall! [Camera zooms out to reveal \"no parking\" sign on brick wall] Patrick: Do you think it belongs to that gift shop right there? [Camera pans to gift shop] SpongeBob: [Walks up to gift shop] What would a gift shop be doing right in the middle of nowhere? Patrick: Uh... selling gifts? [SpongeBob and Patrick enter gift shop] SpongeBob: [Looking around] Wow Patrick, look at all this stuff! [Taking multiple pictures] You gonna buy something? Patrick: No, I'm not in the market for any souvenirs. SpongeBob: Oh, you could never have to many- [Gasps] Oh no! I just realized what this place is! Patrick: You have? SpongeBob: Patrick, we have walked straight into a [whispering] tourist trap. Patrick: A trap! SpongeBob: Shhh... Patrick: [Whispering] A trap! SpongeBob: [Sweating] Come on. Let's escape, before we spend all our money on useless trinkets.

This vacation has it all! Patrick: [Closes brochure] All except for one thing. SpongeBob: What's that? Patrick: A way out of here. SpongeBob: My poor parents must be worried sick.
