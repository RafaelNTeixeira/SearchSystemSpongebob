        "synopsis": "Early one Sunday morning, Squidward goes to his window to play his clarinet. However, SpongeBob's alarm clock goes off at the same time, jamming Squidward's clarinet in his throat. SpongeBob asks Squidward if he'd like to go jellyfishing, but Squidward's voice is muffled thanks to the clarinet. He takes Squidward's squeals of protest as a \"yes.\" After dislodging the clarinet from his throat, Squidward finds SpongeBob and Patrick waiting for him. When he refuses to come out, Patrick realizes he doesn't want to play with them, but SpongeBob believes it is because he is still preparing to play with them and so repeatedly asks him if he is ready.Squidward asks SpongeBob why he is not at work, to which SpongeBob replies that the Krusty Krab is closed on Sundays. Squidward tells them to wait for him, closes the door, then sneaks out the back and heads for the Krusty Krab in the hopes of getting away from SpongeBob and Patrick. He finds it is indeed deserted, but SpongeBob and Patrick soon arrive calling for Squidward. He runs to the kitchen and hides in the storage freezer. When SpongeBob and Patrick cannot find him, they assume he is already at Jellyfish Fields and leave. Squidward tries to exit the freezer only to find that the door is locked, but he assures himself that someone will find him soon enough.Squidward stays stuck in the freezer for the next 2,000 years, frozen in a block of ice. Suddenly, the door's rusted hinges give way and Squidward falls to the floor. SpongeTron, a robotic descendant of SpongeBob, sees the frozen cephalopod and thaws him out. Squidward is shocked to discover that he is in the future and begs for a way to get back to his own time. In response, SpongeTron directs him to a time machine. Squidward decides that he will travel to a time before SpongeBob has born, simply referred to as \"the past.\"The time machine arrives in the primordial sea. Squidward hopes that he can finally play his clarinet in peace, but he soon runs into a primitive sponge and starfish. The two remain curious about Squidward, but are soon distracted by a jellyfish, which they are frightened of. Taking his chance to get away, Squidward tries to play once more but is constantly interrupted by the screams of the primitives, who are zapping themselves with the jellyfish. Squidward has them tear pieces off their loincloths and proceeds to fashion jellyfish nets for them. Amazed by Squidward's demonstration of jellyfishing, the primitives take the nets in earnest.Squidward begins to play at last. However, the wailing of the clarinet aggravates the primitives and they chase him down. Barely making it back to the time machine, Squidward frantically jams the lever up and down and accidentally snaps it off, sending the machine hurtling through time and space before arriving in a world of emptiness.Squidward is glad to have found a place where he can be alone, but hearing several disembodied voices repeating the word \"alone,\" prove too much for him to bear. He frantically tries and fails to escape (repeatedly coming back to the same spot where he started). Desperate, he stomps on the ground in frustration and crashes through the floor and back into the time machine. Squidward breaks down sobbing and begs the time machine to take him home to the present, saying that he misses Bikini Bottom and even SpongeBob.At his words, the time machine returns Squidward to Conch Street, where SpongeBob and Patrick await him. When they ask him if he is finally ready for jellyfishing, Squidward refuses and demands to know who invented such a foolish game. They remind him that it was, in fact, he who invented it, and Squidward, realizing he has inadvertently caused a temporal paradox, states that he is going back to rectify his mistake.",

        "transcript": "Robotic Voice: [reading title card] SB-129. [The episode opens with a view of Bikini Atoll in the morning.] French Narrator: Ah, it is Sunday morning in Bikini Bottom, and it is about time for Squidward to practice his clarinet. So get your ear plugs ready. Squidward: [kisses his clarinet] I think I'll treat Bikini Bottom to some real music. [He gets ready to play his clarinet, and then SpongeBob's alarm clock goes off, sending Squidward's clarinet into his throat] Yow! [Struggles to dislodge the clarinet out of his throat.] SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward! Wanna go jellyfishing? [Squidward tries to yell, but his clarinet sounds every time he tries to talk] Great! We'll be right over! [Squidward pulls the clarinet out of his throat. Door knocks are heard] Squidward: I wonder who that could be. [Squidward opens the door] SpongeBob: Ready to go? Squidward: No, I'm not \"ready to go!\" [slams the door] Patrick: He doesn't wanna play with us. SpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's just not ready. [Squidward tries to play his clarinet, but he hears another knock at the door] Ready now? Squidward: No! [slams door. Then he goes back to try to play clarinet is interrupted once again by yet another knock at door. Squidward gets angry.] SpongeBob: How about now? Squidward: No! [slams the door. The knock on the door is heard again] Huh? [opens door] SpongeBob: Now? Squidward: No! [slams the door. Another knock on the door and he opens it] SpongeBob: Now? Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it] SpongeBob: How about now? Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it] SpongeBob: Now? Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it] SpongeBob: Now? Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it] SpongeBob: Now? Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it] SpongeBob: Now? Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it] No! [SpongeBob and Patrick are gone and they approach Squidward from behind. SpongeBob taps his shoulder] What?! SpongeBob: Ready yet? Squidward: No, I'm not ready! I'll never be ready! Don't you get it?! SpongeBob: Sure we do. Squidward: What? [stammers] D'oh...! [shuts the door and leaves his house, then realizes he's outside. He runs back to his door and knocks. SpongeBob opens it] SpongeBob: Ready? [Squidward slaps his forehead, and then pushes SpongeBob and Patrick out of his house] Squidward: Out! Sheesh! Shouldn't you be at work today, SpongeBob?! SpongeBob: I'd love to be at work today! But it's Sunday; the Krusty Krab is closed. [Squidward gets an idea] Squidward: Hold on a second. I'll be right out. [closes the door. Squidward tiptoes out the other way of his house to the Krusty Krab, and enters] Hello...? [silence] Ahh, alone at last. [tries to play his clarinet, but SpongeBob and Patrick are heard outside] SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! Squidward? [Squidward runs into the kitchen as SpongeBob and Patrick come in the Krusty Krab and search for Squidward] Squidward! [Squidward runs into the freezer] Squidward? Oh, Squidward! [Squidward peeks out as SpongeBob and Patrick look for him] Squidward! SpongeBob: Well, he's not here. I'll bet that eager-beaver's already down at Jellyfish Fields! Squidward: A-ha! They're finally gone! [tries to open the freezer, but it's locked from the inside!] What the...? [tries to open it multiple times] Locked?! Oh, no! Oh well, someone will realize I'm gone and come looking for me. I'll be out of here in no time. French Narrator: 2,000 years later... [the scene shows Squidward still inside the freezer, frozen; the hinges are rusty, and they fall off; the door falls with Squidward frozen behind it; a robot descendant of SpongeBob flies past and then back to Squidward] SpongeTron: Holy Krabby Patties! A frozen cephalopod! [SpongeTron grabs a chrome hammer; from the hammer comes a red laser, which melts the ice and hits Squidward's buttocks; Squidward screams] Squidward: [trancelike] I'll be out of here in no time. SpongeTron: Greetings, primitive. Squidward: Sp...SpongeBob? Is that you? SpongeTron: SpongeBob? No! [robot voice] I am SpongeTron. [normal voice] Welcome to the future! Squidward: What? SpongeTron: Welcome to the future! Squidward: Uh, the future... [notices everything's chrome] Huh?! O-okay, uh, what's going on here? Why is everything... chrome? SpongeTron: Everything is chrome in the future! Squidward: Wha...? [stammers and runs to look outside a window] Oh, my... [notices the chrome environment. The screen pans around the chrome environment.] Impossible! He's lying! [A flower pops up from underground, then a truck comes, Incidental 119 gets out of the truck, runs up to the flower, sprays it with chrome spray paint, then runs back in the truck and drives away. Squidward looks at the screen.] Squidward: [Looks away from the window] He's right! SpongeTron: Of course I'm right, Squidward! Just ask my clones: SpongeTrons X, Y, and Z. [Squidward flinches as a trio of SpongeTron clones have suddenly appeared next to them] Squidward: Are the other letters of the alphabet involved here? SpongeTron: Sure! All 486 of them! [A calendar on the wall says March 6, 4017 A.D. This means Squidward entered the freezer on March 6, 2017. Squidward does a few sit-ups while he talks as if he is trying to wake up] Squidward: [Lays down and starts doing sit-ups] Future! Future! Future! Future! [SpongeTron drops a brick on Squidward's head] Thanks. Now listen! All of you! I don't belong here. This is all a horrible mistake! Please, we've got to do something! SpongeTrons X, Y, and Z: [pull out jellyfishing nets] Jellyfishing! [a two-headed Patrick appears out of nowhere] PatTron: Did somebody say, \"jellyfishing\"? SpongeTron: Hi, PatTron! Squidward: J-just listen to me! I'm not supposed to be here! I've gotta get home to my own time period! I've gotta go! SpongeTron: Well, why didn't you just ask? The time machine is down the hall, to the left. [Squidward runs to the door, laughs and enters, but the sound of a can-opener being used is heard. Squidward steps out and is torn into pieces, now appearing like a spring-shaped patch of skin] Oops! Oh, yeah, that one's the can opener... but try the one on the right. [Squidward tries the door on the right and enters a pink and green room that has a slot-looking machine that says \"past\" and \"future\" with a key near the slot] Squidward: Well, I wouldn't've chosen this interior... [notices time-travel handle] Oh, what's this? Well, if SpongeBob exists in the future, I'd better go to the past! [Squidward turns the key and puts the lever on \"past.\" Siren goes off as time machine disappears from where it used to be in the Krusty Krab. SpongeTron waves at Squidward. The door and the wall fly through a hyperspace-like warp, then the time machine appears in a primitive Bikini Bottom.] Squidward: [looks out and sees an Ammonite swim by. Whales calls can be heard] Wow, primitive. Has sort of an old-world charm. [a snake-like creature swims by really close to Squidward's face] Whoa! I guess this is before manners were invented! Well, at least there's no sign of SpongeBrat. Maybe now I can finally be alone with my clarinet. [hears a noise, turns around, but some shadow quickly hides. He hears another noise and checks again, but a different shadow hides] Huh? [one of the shadow figures swing from tree to tree] Huh? What?! [a shadow figure hides behind a tree] Huh!? [the other shadow figure hides behind a ledge. Squidward keeps walking and then notices a Prehistoric Sponge on the ground] SpongeBob? [Primate Sponge screams] Stay back! [Primate Sponge touches Squidward's arm and then sniffs his finger from what he touched. Tries to give some to Squidward] Uh, no thanks. [Squidward feels someone breathing on him and he turns and notices a Prehistoric Starfish breathing on him. Prehistoric Starfish smiles and reveals nasty, rotten teeth] Uh, hi there. Well, I better be going now. [Prehistoric Sponge grabs Squidward's tentacle] Yes, that's my arm. [Prehistoric Sponge puts Squidward's arm on his head and Prehistoric Starfish licks his hand] Oh, that's sweet. [Prehistoric Starfish gets scared; he smashes on the ground and gets the shivers] What, is it time for your flea bath now? [a jellyfish swims by and Prehistoric Starfish ducks for protection] Oh, look, it's just a little jellyfish. [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish run around screaming] Well, I'm going away now. [Squidward walks away] Ah, here's a nice, shady spot, away from those fools! [Squidward plays his clarinet and each time he tries to play, but Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish holler in pain while each giving a turn at holding the jellyfish] Squidward: What are you simpletons doing?! You're supposed to catch these things, not torture yourself with them! [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish are confused] Give me those loincloths! [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish tear off a piece of their loincloth] I can't believe it. [mumbles to self. Crafts the loincloth jellyfishing nets. Shows them the nets.] This oughta make things go a little smoother! [gives Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish their nets. They put the nets on their lips. Squidward facepalms and grabs the nets back] Give me those things! You're supposed to catch them, like this! [Squidward catches the jellyfish in one of the loincloth nets] It's called jellyfishing. [Primate SpongeBob and Prehistoric Starfish grab the nets and chase the jellyfish] Ah, finally. [sits on the ground and plays his clarinet. Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish hear it, go berserk and chase Squidward. Squidward runs into the time machine as Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish try to get in by climbing on top of it; Squidward screams] Get me outta here! [frantically jams lever up and down and accidentally snaps it off] Uh-oh. [the word FUTURE spins like a slot machine, and stops on 2 lemons and a \"BAR\"] Time Machine: Loser! [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish are banging on the time machine trying to get to Squidward until it disappears into thin-air. The time machine shakes from the inside, with Squidward scared. The camera zooms in, with a \"paint\" effect, then the camera is on Squidward's face, and a color change effect goes off as Squidward mouths the line \"What's going on?\" without audible dialogue. The screen flashes white, and the time machine goes through all sorts of dimensions, with one with a computer-like area, then the time machine folds like paper, and it vanishes with a zap sound.] [Squidward appears in a blank, white space. He walks around, and hears a strange voice. He then notices some colored tiles and lifts one up and it floats and vanishes] Squidward: He's not here. No more SpongeBob. No more! I may finally have found a place where I can be all... [Squidward becomes tiny] ...alone! [a bunch of \"alone\" sayings appear with a different voice as each comes up] Voices: Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! [Continuous \"Alone\" chanting is heard, as the screen continuously gets smaller and smaller] Squidward: [is now suddenly closer to the camera and speaks to it] I gotta get outta of here! [Squidward tries to run, but he runs off and on the scene. He stops and tries to catch his breath. A strange voice is heard again, he holds his head, sweats a little, and runs again off and on the scene. He stops running after three tries to get out, yet another strange voice is heard when he stops] Where's the time machine?! Where's anything?! Where, where, where, where?! [jumps up and down angrily and busts a hole through the ground into the time machine. The handle is still broken off. Squidward bangs on the broken controls and sobs] I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I miss Bikini Bottom! I miss my Easter Island head! I even miss SpongeBob! [right when Squidward says \"SpongeBob,\" the time machine disappears and reappears in present time Bikini Bottom where SpongeBob and Patrick are still waiting for Squidward in front of his house] SpongeBob! Patrick! SpongeBob and Patrick: Hi, Squidward. Squidward: Oh, I'm back! I can't believe this. I-I-I was in space, a-and I went to the future, and-and then I went to the past, and-and then-then I was nowhere, but now I'm back, and-and... you don't know how happy I am to see you guys. SpongeBob: Does this mean you wanna go... SpongeBob and Patrick: Jellyfishing? Squidward: [yelling] No! D'oh! Who's the barnacle head who invented that game anyway? SpongeBob and Patrick: You are, Squidward! [Squidward turns his head to face the camera again. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh as the scene cuts to Bikini Atoll on the surface] Squidward: I'm going back. [The episode ends.]",

        "synopsis": "An excited SpongeBob rides his unicycle to Mrs. Puff's Boating School for his driving exam to start the episode, eager to finally get his driver's license. When he arrives, he throws his unicycle away under the assumption that he will definitely pass and no longer need it. Having taken the oral exam 37 times before, SpongeBob is able to answer most of the questions before Mrs. Puff even asks them. However, upon reaching the driving portion, SpongeBob gets nervous and quickly loses control of the boat, crashing into a lighthouse and causing Mrs. Puff's body to inflate.Later that night, SpongeBob complains about his failure to Gary, who asks him to go for a walk, which he declines. Patrick is then heard talking to him from a walkie-talkie under his covers. He asks SpongeBob to head to his library for a \"surprise,\" and SpongeBob finds Patrick wearing his clothes and calling himself \"Patrick SquarePants.\" SpongeBob is too depressed to laugh at this, and explains his problem to Patrick, mentioning that he needs someone to help him \"think straight\" during the driving test. Patrick quickly devises a plan. Using a cowboy hat to hide the antenna, he puts a walkie-talkie inside SpongeBob's head so he can offer advice.The next day, SpongeBob goes back to take the test again. When asked to start the boat, he initially panics, but Patrick's instructions keep him calm. Just after SpongeBob puts the boat in drive, he almost floors the pedal, but Patrick stops him just before his foot touches the pedal. Patrick then tells him to use his big toe on the pedal, and SpongeBob's toe pops out of his shoe to gently press the pedal. This is followed by a montage of SpongeBob acing the exam, interspersed with shots of Patrick eating SpongeBob's food, and reading his diary while helping him.Mrs. Puff is floored by SpongeBob's sudden improvement and jokingly suggests that his success is due to an antenna under his hat through which \"some guy miles away from here\" is giving him all the answers. SpongeBob (and Patrick) finds this hilarious until Mrs. Puff tells SpongeBob it would be cheating to do so. Upon realizing he has been cheating, SpongeBob goes into hysterics, followed by Patrick. Devastated and ashamed about what he has done, Patrick flees to his house, crying. SpongeBob starts driving wildly all over the course and sobbing, while Mrs. Puff, in a panic, tries desperately to stop him. SpongeBob is too distraught to listen and crashes the boat, failing the test and causing Mrs. Puff to inflate once again. As the episode ends with SpongeBob leaving boating school, he finds Gary riding his unicycle. SpongeBob rides off on it, with Gary atop his head, and happily rides off to visit the hospital, thus ending the episode from there.",

        "transcript": "[The episode begins with an aerial view of Patrick's, Squidward's, and SpongeBob's houses in the morning. The camera zooms in to SpongeBob's. SpongeBob is snoring in his bedroom until the foghorn alarm goes off at 7:00.] SpongeBob: [puts way his blanket] This is it, Gary! Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob's bed bounces up and flings SpongeBob onto the calendar, where he lands on March 3rd with the words \"boating exam today!\" on it then drops to the floor] SpongeBob: The big boating exam is today! I've never felt so capable! [A door opens from underneath him. He comes out of his house riding a unicycle] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. Squidward! Squidward! Squidward: What? SpongeBob: I'm ready, Squidward! [rides his unicycle around Squidward's house] Squidward: Ready to move? SpongeBob: No, I'm ready to pass my boating test. [rides his unicycle, cut to Mrs. Puff's Boating School as a foghorn sounds] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... [stops his unicycle near a dumpster and jumps off of it] I'm ready, I'm ready-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-ready. Well, pal, I won't be needing you anymore. [throws the unicycle into the dumpster] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! Oh, yeah! I'm ready! Incidental 27: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! Hey, I just got my license! SpongeBob: [snaps his fingers] Hey, I'm getting mine next! Incidental 27: Hey, I doubt it! [walks off] SpongeBob: Okay, see you on the road. I'm ready! Here I come, Mrs. Puff! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. [jumps around the boardwalk. Camera goes inside the school as Mrs. Penelope Puff, a female pufferfish, looks out the window and sees SpongeBob jumping around.] Mrs. Penelope Puff: [sighs] I'm not ready. [opens the door] SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff! Today is the day I'm going to pass my boating exam! Mrs. Puff: [with a clipboard and a pen in hand] We'll see about that, SpongeBob. First we must... SpongeBob: First I must pass the oral exam. I am confident in my abilities to successfully succeed. Mrs. Puff: I know. Okay, number 1: What is the front of the boat? SpongeBob: The bow. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answer] Mrs. Puff: What is the back? SpongeBob: Stern. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answer] Mrs. Puff: Number 3: Right is... SpongeBob: Starboard. [answers the remaining questions] Port. Skipper. Deck. Cabin. Galley. Keel. 1924. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answers] Mrs. Puff: You've passed the oral test. [sarcastically] What a surprise. [gets in the boat and secures herself tightly] Now it's time to once again take the driving portion of the exam. Okay, SpongeBob, get in the boat. SpongeBob: Oh, in this boat right here? [looks at his watch] Is it time already? Mrs. Puff: Get in the boat, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Oh yeah, absolutely. [gets in and closes his eyes with a smile] Mrs. Puff: All you have to do is get on the track. [SpongeBob's eyes spring open in awe; he looks ahead to the track that gets longer and longer in delusion] Mrs. Puff: Okay, SpongeBob, what's the first thing you do? SpongeBob: 1924...? Mrs. Puff: No, no. First thing is to start the boat. [turns the engine on and SpongeBob goes crazy] SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Relax, it's only the boat. SpongeBob: The boat? Mrs. Puff: Okay, now what do you do next? SpongeBob: Floor it? Mrs. Puff: Yes... no! No, don't floor it. SpongeBob: Floor it?! Mrs. Puff: No, no, don't, don't floor it! SpongeBob: Okay, floor it! [SpongeBob slams on the accelerator and starts driving backwards really fast] Mrs. Puff: No! No, no, no, nooooo! [the boat whizzes by some spectators before crashing into a lighthouse. After crashing, Mrs. Puff inflates to three times her size. The lighthouse falls, and Mrs. Puff speaks with a deep voice] Oh, SpongeBob, why? Fred: My leg...! [The scene fades to SpongeBob's home at nighttime.] SpongeBob: [in his bed] I don't know why, Gary. I don't know. I'm tired of failing that boating test. I've already taken it 37 times. Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Okay, 38. [puts his pillow on his head] Gary: [puts on SpongeBob's boots] Meow. SpongeBob: No, Gary, I'm not walking. Patrick: [over walkie-talkie in SpongeBob's bed] SpongeBob, this is Star Ranger, over. SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] What is it, Patrick? Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] I got a surprise for you. SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Oh, Patrick, I'm not in the mood. Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Get out of bed. [SpongeBob gets out of bed] SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, now what, Patrick? Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Go to your closet for a surprise. [SpongeBob slides down a room and stands up in front of his closet door] SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, I'm at the closet. Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Listen carefully. What's pink and square at the same time? SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] I don't know, Patrick. [opens the closet door, revealing Patrick wearing SpongeBob's clothes] Patrick: Patrick SquarePants! SpongeBob: [deadpan] Pat, don't do that. [sits in a chair] I've got too much to worry about. Patrick: What's the problem? SpongeBob: I can't pass my boating exam. I've taken it 37... Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: ...uhh, 38 times. I know all the answers... [Patrick's square pants rip off] ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight. Patrick: Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I'll do all the thinking for you. [takes SpongeBob's walkie-talkie] SpongeBob: How are we going to do that? [Patrick puts a walkie-talkie into SpongeBob's head with the antenna coming out of the top] Patrick: Come in, SpongeBob. Hello? Hello? SpongeBob: Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers. [notices the antenna sticking out] Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head? [Patrick puts a tall hat over the antenna. The scene changes to a big telescope peeking out SpongeBob's upstairs window] Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Pat to Sponge, Pat to Sponge, testing, testing. [looking through the telescope at SpongeBob] Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing! [loudly] Testing! [screams] Test, test! Do you read?! SpongeBob: Sponge to Pat, I read you loud and clear, over. Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Got your apple ready? [SpongeBob shows an apple] Lucky undergarments? Hold on. Hold on. [focuses in on the underwear with the telescope to reveal the word lucky on the top of it] Bingo! Underwear, apple, and me. You're ready to get that license. Uh-oh, here comes Mrs. Puff! Act natural. [SpongeBob jumps out of the boat, then gets on the ground on all fours and starts chewing grass.] SpongeBob: [Moos like a cow] Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] No, no, get in the boat! [SpongeBob jumps in the boat. An ambulance arrives with its siren on and drops off Mrs. Puff] Give her the apple. [SpongeBob gives her the apple] SpongeBob: Here you go, ma'am. [Mrs. Puff throws apple in her mouth and swallows] Mrs. Puff: Let's get this over with. [takes a deep breath] What's the first thing you do? [puts hands and arms over head for protection] SpongeBob: [starts to get scared] Uhh... Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Start the boat. [SpongeBob starts the boat. The engine starting up causes Mrs. Puff to go crazy] SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff: Whoa-ho! Huh? What? SpongeBob: It's okay, it's only the boat. Mrs. Puff: The boat? You started the boat? SpongeBob: I... I think so. Mrs. Puff: Oh. Well... what's the second thing you do? SpongeBob: 1924? Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] No, no, put it in drive. SpongeBob: Put it in drive? Mrs. Puff: Yes, yes, yes! [SpongeBob pushes lever down to drive] Put it in drive. Then what? SpongeBob: [lifts leg up] Floor it? Mrs. Puff: No! [screams] No! Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Freeze, mister! [SpongeBob stops] Big toe. [SpongeBob's big toe pops out of his shoe and gently pushes the accelerator down] Mrs. Puff: Oh, gracious. Oh, gracious! Oh-oh. Ha-ha! Ah, we haven't crashed yet. Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, you're coming to your first turn. [a giant wall with the word wall on it is shown and a left curve] Mrs. Puff: Oh no, the first turn. Please, tell me you know what to do at the first turn! Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Left. [SpongeBob turns left] Mrs. Puff: Oh! Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Right. [SpongeBob turns right] Mrs. Puff: Oh! My, this is splendid, SpongeBob. You're doing fine. Montage: [SpongeBob stops at a stop sign and looks both ways before starting to drive again. Then drives around with his left arm out making a signal. Patrick still talking to SpongeBob through the walkie-talkie as SpongeBob drives over a big hill in the road. As Mrs. Puff writes a couple things on her clipboard, Patrick is putting on another pair of SquarePants. SpongeBob pulls back on the boat and the boat jumps in the air over a big anchor. Patrick finds SpongeBob's diary and begins to read and laugh at it as SpongeBob jumps off a ramp through a ring of fire. Fred is walking across the course but SpongeBob stops the boat and helps him walk across. He gets back in the boat as Patrick is eating a sandwich out of SpongeBob's fridge. SpongeBob is sitting back and driving with his feet and driving upside down.] Mrs. Puff: Splendid! Wonderful! [sign that reads finish line is just ahead] There's the finish line. It's unbelievable. You've shown the most spectacular improvement of any student I've ever seen. What's your secret? A little radio in your head? [everyone laughs] Oh, and under that hat is some kind of, uhh, antenna? [everyone laughs again] And some guy miles away from here is giving you all the answers? [everyone laughs a third time] Oh, yes, but that would be cheating. [SpongeBob opens his eyes wide realizing he is cheating; only Patrick laughs] Patrick: Cheating! [laughing hysterically] SpongeBob: I'm cheating?! Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff: Yes, my star pupil? SpongeBob: I think I'm cheating. Mrs. Puff: What's that, dear? [SpongeBob takes a hold of Mrs. Puff] SpongeBob: I think I am cheating! Mrs. Puff: You've... you've let go of the wheel. SpongeBob: I do have an antenna under my hat! [shows the antenna under his hat] There is a guy giving me all the answers! It's all true! [crying] I'm cheating! I'm cheating! I'm cheating! Patrick: What?! [runs out of SpongeBob's house and back under his rock, crying] SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry! Mrs. Puff: [panicking] The wheel, SpongeBob! The wheel... SpongeBob: Cheating... I'm a cheater! Cheater! Mrs. Puff: No, no, no! It's quite alright! You can cheat that way! SpongeBob: No, I'm cheating! Mrs. Puff: That way, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: I'm cheating! Mrs. Puff: Cheat that way! That way! SpongeBob: I'm a cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater! Mrs. Puff: It's okay to cheat today! SpongeBob: No! Mrs. Puff: That way! That way! Cheat that way! SpongeBob: Cheater...! [crashes offscreen head-on into the same lighthouse. Mrs. Puff inflates with a look of despair. The lighthouse falls yet again] Mrs. Puff: [deep voice] Oh, SpongeBob, why? SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I think I cheated. Fred: My leg! [The scene fades to black, then changes to some time later, as EMTs are wheeling a still-inflated Mrs. Puff away on a gurney.] SpongeBob: Uhh, I'm sorry for letting you down again, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: [normal voice] It's okay, SpongeBob. You didn't mean it. Okay, boys, take me away. [EMTs shove Mrs. Puff into the ambulance] SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'll try harder next semester. [Mrs. Puff cries as she is taken away by the ambulance] It'll be great! [walks away] Only now I don't even have my bike. Gary: [with SpongeBob's unicycle] Meow. SpongeBob: Gary! My bike! You found it! This sponge is still mobile! [rides away on his bike with Gary on his head] Alright, let's go surprise someone at the hospital! [The episode fades to black.]",

        "synopsis": "It’s closing time at the Krusty Krab, and Squidward answers a last-minute phone call from a customer. Just as he is about to tell the customer the restaurant is closed, Mr. Krabs suddenly appears and snatches the phone from Squidward's hands and answers it himself. The customer tells Mr. Krabs that he wants to order a pizza and have it delivered, which Mr. Krabs happily agrees to knowing he'll make extra money out of it. Squidward protests this by saying that the restaurant doesn't serve pizza nor do they do deliveries, but Mr. Krabs spontaneously makes a pizza out of Krabby Patties and forces Squidward and SpongeBob to deliver it.After SpongeBob does a vehicle inspection on a boatmobile, Squidward tells him to drive. However, SpongeBob says he cannot as he still in boating school and doesn't have a license, but Squidward says that he doesn't want to drive either and tells him \"it's just around the corner\" and to \"just do what you do in school.\" As expected, SpongeBob becomes increasingly nervous when trying to shift the boat into reverse and, after an annoyed Squidward yells at him to \"back it up,\" he finally panics and ends up reversing the boat for miles and miles until the boat stalls in the middle of a big desert. Thinking the boat has run out of gas, Squidward complains about their predicament and eventually kicks the boat out of frustration when SpongeBob says the pizza is getting cold. This causes the boat to suddenly start back up and drive off unoccupied, leaving the two stranded and forced to continue the delivery on foot.Throughout the journey, the duo encounters numerous mishaps. First, SpongeBob tries a pioneer trick he claims to have seen in a movie where he listens to the ground and hears a truck coming. When SpongeBob tries to get the driver's attention by doing a strange dance in the middle of the road, the driver speeds up and Squidward pushes SpongeBob out of the way so he does not get mowed down. Later, the pizza box becomes caught in heavy winds and SpongeBob refuses to let go of it even after a tornado forms and sucks both him and Squidward into it. However, the pizza actually saves their lives when it turns into a parachute.Upon landing on solid ground, Squidward panics when he notices the road they were following is nowhere in sight. SpongeBob notices a rock with moss on it and suggests they go in the direction where the moss is pointing, saying that \"moss always points to civilisation\" (another pioneer trick he learned). Refusing to follow SpongeBob's tip, Squidward goes in the opposite direction, unaware that the moss was actually directing them to a nearby city.Much time passes, and the two become tired and hungry, so SpongeBob suggests eating coral like the pioneers did. But while SpongeBob tries to remember if it was actually sand or mud, an exasperated Squidward demands to eat the pizza, having given up hope on delivering it. The two then begin arguing over it with SpongeBob insisting it still be delivered, and after a brief chase, Squidward prepares to take the pizza by force. However, SpongeBob becomes overjoyed when he notices a giant rock nearby and, after exclaiming that the pioneers had driven them for miles, says that they can ride it out of the desert. Finally fed up with the pioneer tricks, Squidward tells SpongeBob to forget about them as there are no pioneers left due to their unusual travelling methods and eating habits. But after SpongeBob runs him over with the rock (revealing they can be driven after all), Squidward changes his mind and the duo proceed to ride the rock all the way to customer's house.Unfortunately, their journey doesn't pay off very well. The customer is happy for a brief moment when he receives his pizza and after realizing that he didn't receive the drink he asks where it is. SpongeBob, confused, checks his order and it looks as if he didn't order a drink (though it's likely that Mr. Krabs hung up before the customer finished his order, or he didn't hear that part of the order, or he didn't care about hearing the customer's long babbling because he wanted the delivery to be done, or the customer assumed he would get one). Angry by this, the customer abusively berates SpongeBob for not bringing his drink and his poor delivery service before throwing the pizza in his face and furiously slamming the door on him.Squidward, having watched the entire scene is horrified and tries to console SpongeBob, but fails as he falls to the ground crying while absorbing his tears. Outraged at how the customer treated SpongeBob all because of a measly drink (after everything the two went through and the ridiculous and tiresome obstacles they've been in a complete waste of time) a furious Squidward confronts the customer and brutally slams the pizza in the his face as payback for his rudeness towards SpongeBob.Squidward then returns to SpongeBob and cheers him up by saying the customer changed his mind about taking the pizza and \"ate the whole thing in one bite,\" even without the drink. With the delivery finally completed, Squidward asks to be taken home, but a cheerful SpongeBob says they still have time to make it back to work and drives back to the Krusty Krab, which is comically revealed to have been right across the street from the customer's house, meaning the whole journey could've easily been avoided. The episode ends as Squidward groans \"Oh, my aching tentacles.\"",

        "transcript": "[The episode begins at nighttime at the Krusty Krab with SpongeBob cleaning a table.] Squidward: Hurry up with those chairs, SpongeBob. It's after closing and I'd like to go home! [phone rings] SpongeBob: I got it, I got it! Coming! [leaps for the phone, but Squidward answers it first. SpongeBob falls to the floor and exclaims] Squidward: Hello? Sorry, sir, we're closed... [Mr. Krabs snatches phone] Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, there, Krusty Krab. How could I help you? [customer explains order over phone] Pizza? Mmm… [eyes turn into dollar signs] Of course we have pizza. Squidward: Uh, Mr. Krabs... Mr. Krabs: Our delivery squid will bring it right over. [hangs up, the customer's gibberish continues but gets cut off] Squidward: But Mr. Krabs, we don't serve pizzas. [Mr. Krabs gets a plate of Krabby Patties and smashes them into a pizza. Then he puts it in a box] We don't deliver. Mr. Krabs: We don't deliver, [gives Squidward the pizza] but you do. Squidward: Can't you just get SpongeBob to do it? Mr. Krabs: Great idea! Take him with you. [SpongeBob sneaks over smiling big] Squidward: That's not what I had in mind! [The scene cuts to SpongeBob and Squidward near the boat outside the Krusty Krab.] SpongeBob: Front end... check. Antenna... [touches the boat antenna making it vibrate] check. Bumper... check. Bumper sticker... [bumper sticker says \"I Brake For Sea Urchins\"] ...check. [uncaps the tire pressure and puts his mouth in it, causing him to inflate like a balloon, and talk in a squeaky, high pitched voice while he is now the size of a giant parade balloon] Tire pressure! [Squidward scared, SpongeBob blows out the rest of the pressure in Squidward's face, returning him to his normal size and voice] ...check. Vehicle inspection complete! We're really making history here, Squidward. That lucky customer is going to get the first Krabby Patty Pizza ever! Squidward: Good, then you drive. [tosses his hat away] SpongeBob: I can't. I'm still in Boating School. Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob. It's just around the corner. SpongeBob: Well, yeah, but... Squidward: Just do what you do in school. SpongeBob: Well, okay. Wait, don't tell me. Squidward: Back it up. SpongeBob: Huh? Squidward: Back... it up. SpongeBob: Right, back... it up. [tries to move the stick shift down] Squidward: Back it up! SpongeBob: Okay, okay! Squidward: Shift into reverse, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Reverse? Oh, yeah, reverse. [SpongeBob imagines the words \"FORWARD\" and \"REVERSE\" turning into Korean writing, 앞으로가 (FORWARD) and 뒤로가 (REVERSE)] Squidward: Back it up! SpongeBob: [shifts gears] Backing up! Backing up! [boat backs up really fast] Squidward: [tries to get the wheel] Gimme the wheel, SpongeBob. Give me the wheel! SpongeBob: Backing up! Backing up! Ba-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ack-i-i-i-i-i-ng up! [They go over a bumpy area with rocks and then they spin around and around and around, screaming. The scene fades into the next morning, as the boat goes over five hills.] Backing up! Backing up! Backing up! Backing up! [boat stops with no fuel left] Backing up. Squidward: Well... you backed up. And you know what? I think we're out of gas. And you know what else? [echoing] We're in the middle of NOWHERE! SpongeBob: And you know what else else? I think the pizza's getting cold. Squidward: [sarcastically startled] And the pizza's cold? Oh, the pizza's cold! Not the pizza! Oh, how could this get any WORSE?! [kicks boat in frustration and the boat's gasoline becomes full again and it drives away into the distance without them] SpongeBob: Well, we can still deliver it on foot. [Squidward narrows his eyes. Later, both walk on the sand] Squidward: Ow, ow, ow. SpongeBob: [singing] ♪ The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza... ♪ Squidward: And my feet are killing me. Whoa! [trips over SpongeBob, who is lying on the ground] SpongeBob? What are you doing? SpongeBob: [rubbing the ground] It's an old pioneer trick. I saw it in a movie once. Squidward: SpongeBob, this is no time for... SpongeBob: Shh, shh, shh. It's working. Squidward: What is it? SpongeBob: [pointing to the road] Truck! Sixteen wheels. Now I can show you how the pioneers hitchhike. [starts dancing in the road while wearing a hat] Whee... eee... [Squidward sits on a rock while playing with a wooden spoon] Swordfish trucker: Thrashin' frashin' break dancers! [honks his truck horn] Squidward: He's stopping! He's stopping! [Squidward realizes he's not stopping and grabs SpongeBob out of the way where they are covered in sand thanks to the truck. Squidward narrows his eyes at the smiling SpongeBob] [The scene cuts to SpongeBob and Squidward resuming walking, despite heavy winds.] SpongeBob: ♪ The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza... ♪ [the wind blows on Squidward's nose making it touch his face so he puts it down, only for it to touch his face again so he puts it in his mouth] ♪ ...is the pizza free delivery. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza very ta-asty. ♪ [SpongeBob gets carried around in the air by the huge winds] Whoa! Squidward: Will you let go of that stupid pizza, already?! SpongeBob: [still being carried around in the air] I can't, it's for the customer! Squidward: Who cares about the customer?! SpongeBob: I do! Squidward: Well, I don't! SpongeBob: [wind stops and SpongeBob gasps] Squidward! [starts flying again] Squidward: Let go of that pizza! SpongeBob: No! [runs over Squidward] Squidward: Ow! [holding SpongeBob's legs] SpongeBob, let go of the pizza! SpongeBob: No! It's for the customer. Squidward: SpongeBob! [they catch sight of a tornado nearby] Let go of the pizza! [gets lifted up into the tornado] SpongeBob: No! Squidward: SpongeBob! [looks down and screams] Hang onto the pizza! [The tornado spits them both out, and both scream while falling down. SpongeBob uses the pizza as a parachute but Squidward falls hard onto the ground] Hey! Hey! [crawls up to the screen] Where's the road? Where's the road? [a tumbleweed rolls by] We're doomed! How are we gonna get home, which way do we go? [SpongeBob lands] What are we gonna do now? There's no road here! SpongeBob: I think town's this way. [points] Squidward: Oh, don't tell me, Jethro. The pioneers? SpongeBob: That's right. [points to a mossy rock] Moss always points to civilization. Squidward: That way? That way there? [SpongeBob nods] So, let me get this straight... you think that we should go that way? SpongeBob: [nods again] Yep. Squidward: Well, then I'm going this way. [heads the other way] SpongeBob: Huh? Squid, wait! I don't think... Squidward: Trust me, I know where I'm going. [Pans out to show another city in the other direction] SpongeBob: [sings] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, absolutivally. [later] pizza... [starts beatboxing] pizza... [later, SpongeBob is walking backwards. SpongeBob's pants almost split into two and move up and down simultaneously while he continues to beatbox. Later, SpongeBob sings with blues-rock soul] Krusty-Kra-aa-aa-yaaa-yeah pizza is the pizza, yeah, for you and [falsetto] me-eee-hee-hee-hee! [Later, SpongeBob and Squidward are weary looking and the former sings exhaustingly] Krab Pizza... for you. Krus... the Krusshy and the... Krab... pizza... [Later, they are both lying face down in the sand] Squidward: Sponge, we gotta eat something. SpongeBob: I heard in times of hardship, the pioneers would eat coral. [Squidward eats some coral] SpongeBob: No, maybe it wasn't coral. [Squidward spits out the coral] SpongeBob: Maybe it was sand. No, no, mud. Squidward: Give me the pizza! SpongeBob: Wait, I remember now! It was coral! Squidward: Give it to me! SpongeBob: No, we promised it's for the customer. Squidward: [fancy music plays] You're right. It's for the customer. SpongeBob: Yeah! Squidward: Maybe we better check on it, make sure it's okay. SpongeBob: Well? Squidward: Just a peek. [opens box] SpongeBob: [he shuts it quickly] Okay, it's fine. Squidward: No, I think I saw something. [opens box] Oh, no. I was wrong. Looks okay. Sure is a fine-looking pizza. SpongeBob: [entranced] Yeah... Squidward: What's that? Is that the cheese? SpongeBob: Yeah... Squidward: And the pepperoni? SpongeBob: Yeah... Squidward: [SpongeBob slurps] Oh, looks good, huh? SpongeBob: [snaps out of it] Wait a second! I know what you're trying to do, Squidward! [closes box] I'm not letting you eat the pizza! Squidward: Give me the pizza! SpongeBob: No! Squidward: Don't make me take it away from you, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Get away! [runs off] Squidward: [chases SpongeBob] Get back here, SpongeBob! Give me the pizza! SpongeBob: NO! Squidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob: NO! Squidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob: NOO! Squidward: Wait... [he becomes too tired to run] SpongeBob: NO! NO! [runs into Squidward] Squidward: I want that pizza and you're gonna hand it over one way or another! SpongeBob: Look, we're saved! Squidward: Sure, we're saved. Now give me some pizza! SpongeBob: No, really, Squid, we're saved! We're saved! We're saved! [he jumps in and out of his pants] Squidward: Will you cut that out?! SpongeBob: [to a conga beat, doing a backflip and some push-ups] Saved, saved, saved, saved! [rips himself apart then the two parts go in circles and then they connect again] Saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! [SpongeBob starts doing a conga dance] Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Yes, we are saved! Squidward: That's just a stupid boulder! SpongeBob: It's not just a boulder. [sniff] It's a rock . [cries and hugs the boulder] A rock! A rock! It's a big beautiful, old rock. [climbs up it and rubs it] Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape. Squidward: SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers?! Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae! And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive... [SpongeBob runs over Squidward with the boulder] ...rocks? Hold on there, Jethro! SpongeBob: [they stop outside a (rust-colored version of Tom)’s house] I can't wait to see the look on our customer's face! [rings doorbell, gives a thumbs-up to Squidward] Tom: Yeah? SpongeBob: Congratulations, sir. Your Krabby Patty pizza is here! Tom: Wow, thanks! I've been dyin' for one of these. It... [he frowns, brief pause] Where's my drink? SpongeBob: [confused] What drink? Tom: [in an angry tone] My drink? My diet Dr. Kelp? Don't tell me you forgot my drink! SpongeBob: [checks through the order, and sees no drink listed.] But, you didn't order any... Tom: [yelling furiously] How am I supposed to eat this pizza without my drink?! SpongeBob: But... but... [tears start rolling down his face] Tom: Didn't you ever once think of the customer?! [throws the pizza box at SpongeBob's face] You call yourself a delivery boy?! Well, I ain't buyin'! [slams the door. SpongeBob goes over to Squidward, smiling and trying not to cry] Squidward: Sponge? Sponge? It's okay. Sponge? [SpongeBob drops the pizza, falls over, starts sobbing, and absorbs his tears over and over] Sponge? [SpongeBob continues crying. Squidward becomes furious. He grabs the pizza, stomps towards Tom’s house and pounds on the door] Tom: [answers the door, still angry] Another one?! Look, I told your little friend I ain't payin' for that! Squidward: [Tom’s point of view] Well, this one's on the house! [slams the pizza box in Tom’s face] SpongeBob: [still crying] Did he change his mind? Squidward: [smugly] He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite. SpongeBob: [stops crying] No drink? Squidward: Nah. Now take me home. [jumps up on the rock] SpongeBob: Are you kidding? We have just enough time to make it back to work! [backs up the rock where they are instantly at the Krusty Krab] Squidward: Work? [screen cuts to black] Oh, my aching tentacles!",

        "synopsis": "At Mrs. Puff's Boating School, it is time to select the hall monitor for the day. Mrs. Puff notices that SpongeBob is the only one who has yet to serve as hall monitor. SpongeBob then approaches Mrs. Puff, and after desperately attempting to find another candidate, she is forced to give the hall monitor duties to SpongeBob.After being elected as Boating School Hall Monitor, SpongeBob gives an extremely long speech, which ends up lasting the entire school day (and thus his whole tenure as hall monitor), which puts Mrs. Puff and all of his schoolmates to sleep. Out of sympathy, Mrs. Puff allows SpongeBob to at least wear his uniform until the next day, though privately apprehensive of her decision.However, SpongeBob goes above and beyond the call of duty and decides to become the \"hall monitor\" of the city, with disastrous results. His activities include an atrociously vain attempt to direct traffic, resulting in a massive crash pile-up, and scaring a couple out of their house in the guise of the \"Open Window Maniac,\" with the intention of showing them the \"dangers\" of leaving a house window open. Later, SpongeBob comes across Patrick eating a strawberry ice cream cone and labels him a criminal after Patrick drops the ice cream on the ground.Then, a newspaper boy comes up to SpongeBob and Patrick, and gives them a newspaper with the headline \"Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom.\" SpongeBob looks at the newspaper headline alerting about a maniac causing trouble around town, blind to the fact that he is himself the article's subject. SpongeBob suggests they stop this maniac, which gives a saddened Patrick the chance to, in his words, \"be good\" by becoming SpongeBob's \"deputy.\" They end up getting ice cream twice as part of Patrick's \"ex-criminal\" advice and then decide to split up to find the maniac, communicating using walkie-talkies.Seconds after SpongeBob runs off, two police officers pull up next to Patrick. They ask him if he has seen the maniac, showing him a wanted poster with a picture of SpongeBob, which he at first mistakes for an imagined, separate maniac, and screams with terror at the mere sight of the poster.The cops patiently assure him that it's just a drawing and not the real thing and instruct him to tell them if he has seen the person when they show the picture. Patrick agrees to cooperate, but he keeps screaming whenever the police show him the sketch. Eventually, the cops decide to have a little fun and repeatedly show and hide the picture as Patrick screams every single time. The officers then drive off, suggesting to Patrick that he stays indoors and take the ice cream cone off his head.Soon, night suddenly falls, and Patrick becomes scared. He calls SpongeBob and asks him to return to home. SpongeBob comes back as Patrick finds a poster of the maniac before he sees SpongeBob in the distance across the street under a streetlight. However, Patrick recognizes him as the maniac rather than SpongeBob. He alerts SpongeBob through his walkie-talkie, and SpongeBob attempts to escape the maniac. Everywhere he goes, Patrick tells him the maniac is there, causing SpongeBob to hide in a mailbox for safety. Upon being told that the maniac is also in there, he bursts his arms and legs out of the mailbox, sprinting around the city in a blind panic. In his terrified state, he topples several buildings and crashes through a fence covered in the wanted posters. After seeing a poster from the fence, he finally realizes that he is the maniac who has been reported in the newspaper and is being pursued by law enforcement causing Patrick to scream and run away offscreen.The police arrive to arrest SpongeBob, but Mrs. Puff appears and berates him for causing the destruction of Bikini Bottom. She then explains and confesses the situation to the police, letting out that he is her responsibility. The police interpret this as taking responsibility for the crimes, and she is arrested instead.Sometime later at Boating School, Mrs. Puff is working with the class on their essay while she is being broadcast on TV from jail, until she tells SpongeBob that he needs to see her after class, \"six months from now.\" and the episode ends with a sound of a cell door slamming.",

        "transcript": "[The episode begins at Mrs. Puff's Boating School.] French Narrator: Mrs. Puff's Boating School. [cut to inside the school] Where diligent students learn the rules of the road. Mrs. Puff: Everyone, put down your books, because it's time to pick out the hall monitor of the day! [SpongeBob squeezes his pencil so hard it shoots up into the air] Let's see here. This week's hall monitor will be Bart, Jimmy, no, no, Tina, Ralph, mm... [gasps and shakes nervously] ...SpongeBob...! [SpongeBob moves his desk between two rows] It's Jimmy! Jimmy's the hall monitor. Incidental 27: Mrs. Puff, I've done it already! [SpongeBob moves his desk closer] Mrs. Puff: Ohh... Bill? Bill/Phil: No way, Mrs. Puff. [SpongeBob moves his desk closer] Mrs. Puff: Uhh, Tina, you're the hall monitor. Incidental 8: Hey, I've done it 3 times already! [SpongeBob moves up closer] Mrs. Puff: B...uh...B-Beth! Student: She graduated! Mrs. Puff: Henry?! [SpongeBob moves closer] Vera?! [SpongeBob moves closer] Clayton?! [SpongeBob is poking Mrs. Puff with his desk as she sighs] Alright, I guess I have no choice. [gulps] The hall monitor of the day is [she sighs] SpongeBob. [SpongeBob launches into the air] SpongeBob: Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall! Mrs. Puff: Okay! Just take the hat and belt. [tries handing him the uniform] SpongeBob: I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First, I have to make my speech. Mrs. Puff: You can't make this easy, can you? SpongeBob: Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: Give me a break. SpongeBob: And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. [sniffs] And furthermore, I will carry out my duties... [clock moves forward in time as SpongeBob continues his speech] ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall! [at this point, almost everyone is dreary-eyed] Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time. [takes out a long roll of paper] \"Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears.\" [the clock has disappeared, and it is now much later in the day. Puff is asleep at her desk] In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform [takes out the hat and belt] and assume my duties as... [puts on the uniform; deep voice] ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff! [walks towards the door then turns around] Oh, and I will be re... [bell rings as all students excitedly run out the door, over SpongeBob] Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, are you okay? SpongeBob: [muffled] I overdid the speech again, didn't I? Mrs. Puff: I'm afraid so. SpongeBob: Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this. [takes off the uniform] I hardly knew ya. [gives the uniform to Mrs. Puff and walks away saddened] Mrs. Puff: Uhh... SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: I can at least let you wear it until tomorrow. SpongeBob: A-hoo! [dives into the uniform] Thanks, Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff: What are the consequences of what I've just done? [Bubble transition to SpongeBob walking down the street, singing somewhat incomprehensibly. He then notices a broken traffic light.] SpongeBob: Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the [deep voice] hall monitor! [directs traffic, with a whistle, to their destination using all sorts of hand gestures, but ends up causing a huge wreck in the end] What would this town do without you, SpongeBob? Fred: My leg! My leg! SpongeBob: [singing] On patrol. I'm on patrol. [notices a house with an open window] Uh-oh, an open window. [peeks through the window and there is a couple eating] Incidental 12: More seaweed medley, dear? SpongeBob: The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example. [jumps through the window and onto their table in a ski mask, screaming as he does so] I'm the open window maniac! [both run out screaming] I hope you learned a valuable lesson! [shuts the window; cut to him walking again] On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol... [gasps as he sees a puddle of pink goo on the ground] Vandals! Another crime. [takes his finger and tastes the pink goo] hmm...strawberry! I must act! [more pink goo falls on his head. He looks up and sees Patrick sitting on top of a wall and eating some strawberry ice cream] Patrick... [looks around for the voice he just heard] Patrick... Patrick... Patrick: My ice cream! It's alive! [screams and throws away the ice cream] SpongeBob: Patrick! Down here! Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, it's you. [ice cream cone is on SpongeBob's face] SpongeBob: Patrick. Come down here. [Patrick jumps down on top of SpongeBob] Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob? SpongeBob: I'm down here. Patrick: Hehe, you look funny! [hops off SpongeBob and pulls him off the ground] Hi, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: That's hall monitor to you! [fixes his shape] Patrick: Sorry, officer. SpongeBob: Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in. Patrick: What crime? [shows him the ice cream that is on the ground] I'm a bad person! [cries] Morty: [high Voice] Extra! Extra! \"Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!\" City paralyzed with fear! [gives one to SpongeBob] [Gruff Voice] Take it, friends. Arm yourselves with knowledge. [runs off] [high voice again] Extra! Extra! Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom! SpongeBob: [reads paper] \"Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wrecks? Break-in?\". Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, [deep voice] the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime? Patrick: [still crying] I wanna be good! SpongeBob: Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority. [Patrick puts the ice cream cone on his head] Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do? Patrick: Hmmm... I'd get an ice cream! [both walk out an ice cream store with ice cream] SpongeBob: Okay, now what? Patrick: Hmmm... [both come out the ice cream store again with ice cream] SpongeBob: This isn't working. [throws his ice cream away] We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies! [takes out two walkie-talkies. Patrick drops his ice cream and happily grabs a walkie-talkie] And now, duty calls! Alright, deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run ‘em out! [SpongeBob runs off sounding like a siren. The police come driving up and stop beside Patrick] Incidental 118: Afternoon, son. Patrick: Hello, brothers. [salutes to the officers, then raises both eyebrows whilst pointing to his cone hat] Incidental 118: Son, we're looking for the maniac. Orange Incidental 118: Have you seen this man ?! [He whips out a poster that says WANTED MANIAC with SpongeBob's picture on it.] Patrick: [screams] It's the maniac! Take him away, take him away! Incidental 118: Calm down, son. It's just a drawing, not the real thing. Now we're gonna show you this picture again, and you tell us if you've seen this guy. Understand? Patrick: Yeah, uh-huh. Incidental 118: Okay. [Orange Incidental 118 shows Patrick the poster again] Patrick: [screams] Horrible! [Orange Incidental 118 removes the poster, bemused. He holds up the poster again. Patrick screams again. Both cops then look at each other and smile slyly. Orange Incidental 118 repeatedly shows and takes away the poster as Patrick screams every single time. Eventually, the cops decide they've had enough fun.] Incidental 118: Stay indoors, son. Orange Incidental 118: And, uhh, take that cone off your head. [both laugh as they drive off] Patrick: [takes out walkie-talkie] SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer! SpongeBob: SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report. Patrick: [over walkie-talkie] I don't wanna be a policeman anymore. I'm scared! SpongeBob: Get a hold of yourself, deputy. Patrick: [over walkie-talkie, sobbing] I wanna go home! SpongeBob: [sighs] Poor rookie. Alright, I'm on my way back. Patrick: Hurry, SpongeBob, I think it's getting... [the bright sky suddenly, becomes dark] ...dark. SpongeBob: Just put on your siren and I'll be right there. Patrick: [imitates siren] Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. [Patrick picks up the poster that the officers showed him earlier. Then sees a darkish figure down the road. It's SpongeBob, but Patrick doesn't realize it; Patrick gasps loudly] Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him! SpongeBob: [over walkie-talkie] Where is he, Patrick? Patrick: [over walkie-talkie] At the intersection of Conch and Coral. [SpongeBob turns his head around to read the street sign that says Conch Street and Coral Avenue] SpongeBob: That's where I am! He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing? Patrick: Uhh, he's just standing there... menacingly ! [screams over walkie-talkie] Get out of there, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams] That's his maniac shriek! He's going to attack! [SpongeBob cries while running around in circles] He's acting all crazy! Run! Uh, hide behind that building! [SpongeBob hides behind the building] No, he's behind that building! Oh, quick, hide behind that street sign! [SpongeBob hides behind the street sign] No wait! The maniac just went behind that sign! Oh, oh quick! Get under the streetlight! [SpongeBob gets under the streetlights] No wait, agh, he's there, too! Run for your life! [SpongeBob jumps inside a mailbox. As he tries to relax, the radio is cutting out] SpongeBob: [over walkie-talkie] Say again, deputy? Patrick: The maniac's in the mailbox! [SpongeBob screams and bursts his arms and legs through the mailbox. He alternates between screaming and crazily jabbering as he runs through four buildings, causing them to topple over and eventually crashes through a fence plastered with wanted posters] SpongeBob: [takes a look at a wanted poster] Huh, this guy's not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick, I'm the maniac! [Patrick screams in the background. Four police cars and several policeman surround SpongeBob] Incidental 118: We'll take that as a confession. [Mrs. Puff appears] Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob SquarePants, there you are! I turn my back on you for one minute and you destroy half the city! You should be ashamed of yourself! [SpongeBob slumps sadly at these words] Incidental 118: You know this guy? Mrs. Puff: Of course I do. I'm the one who gave him the uniform in the first place. He's my responsibility. [the cops glare at her] Uh-oh... [Bubble transition to the next morning at the boating school where the whole class, except SpongeBob, is sleeping. Mrs. Puff is teaching class from jail through the TV] Mrs. Puff: And in conclusion, students: red means stop, green means go. And SpongeBob... SpongeBob: [frowns nervously] Yes, Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: I'd like to see you after class. 6 months from now! [jail closure sound as the episode ends]",

        "synopsis": "While at work, SpongeBob daydreams about becoming a jellyfish and living in Jellyfish Fields; his inattention leads to a fire. SpongeBob explains his wish to Mr. Krabs, who laughs and says that SpongeBob would not last a day in the wild. Undeterred, SpongeBob quits his job and gives away all of his possessions to his friends. He even gives a tearful Patrick a large jar of mayonnaise, a stash of old phone books, and his prized jellyfish net, Ol' Reliable. Sandy is shocked to hear of SpongeBob's plans and tries to convince him otherwise, but SpongeBob declines and hopes that maybe one day they will end up like him. After saying goodbye to all his friends, SpongeBob removes his pants (except his shoes) and runs away naked while acting like a jellyfish, leaving Sandy and Squidward somewhat confused as to why he took off his pants. They leave after betting on his maximum time (Sandy gives him a week and Squidward gives him 11 minutes (clearly breaking the 4th Wall as each episode usually takes around said amount of time)) while Patrick starts to cry because he is devastated at the departure of his best friend.Once he arrives at Jellyfish Fields, SpongeBob is glad to be \"home\" and he tries to blend in with the other jellyfish. Patrick and Sandy have a picnic to try to trick SpongeBob into coming home, but SpongeBob resists, still insisting that he belongs with the jellyfish. A crazed and heartbroken Patrick soon returns with SpongeBob's jellyfish net, Ol' Reliable, having decided that if SpongeBob refuses to come home, then he'll force him to come back by capturing him and making him his trophy (even going as far as to make a trophy jar (possibly out of the same mayonnaise jar from before) meant for SpongeBob). SpongeBob frantically tries to dissuade Patrick into moving on as his former friend chases him through Jellyfish Fields.SpongeBob eventually jumps into a jellyfish hive out of Patrick's reach, finally forcing Patrick to give up. When the jellyfish return, they sting SpongeBob and chase him away. That night, SpongeBob tries to sleep in a cave, but feels very itchy. He finds poison sea urchins all over him, forcing him to run out of the cave scratching himself very fast.Finally realizing that the wilderness is not as good as he thought, SpongeBob tearfully returns to Bikini Bottom, muttering to himself that he gave up his life and friends for nothing. Upon reaching the pineapple, he is greeted with a \"Welcome Home\" party by his friends. All is forgiven, SpongeBob puts his clothes back on, and Mr. Krabs gives him his Krusty Krab employee hat back. Everyone then piles in Squidward (who is unhappy) for a group hug. However, the poison sea urchin bacteria spreads and everyone except SpongeBob becomes itchy. Therefore, he concludes by stating \"It's great to be home!\"",

        "transcript": "[The episode begins with Dream SpongeBob grilling Krabby Patties in the Krusty Krab kitchen until one of them suddenly levitates up from the grill and turns into a jellyfish. It floats out the window as the rest of the patties turn into jellyfish and do the same. Dream SpongeBob follows them and flies out the window and turns into a jellyfish. He buzzes around Jellyfish Fields when he hears Mr. Krabs voice.] Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? SpongeBob! [Shows reality of SpongeBob at the kitchen. The grill is on fire, smoke clearly coming out of it] Mr. Krabs: Wake up, boy! You're burning me money! [SpongeBob wakes up from his dream and screams. Then runs behind Mr. Krabs] SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what do we do? Mr. Krabs: Here, use this! [Mr. Krabs hands SpongeBob a fire extinguisher. SpongeBob throws it at the grill. Mr. Krabs glares at the smiling SpongeBob for his stupidity, as he realizes his error before the grill's fire becomes larger than before.] SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: Whoa! [SpongeBob runs up to the grill and tries to blow out the fire to no avail. Until a fireman comes into the kitchen with a hose] Fireman: [imitating the sound of a fire truck] [Fireman sprays SpongeBob with the water. SpongeBob enlarges and falls backwards, which puts out the fire] Mr. Krabs and Fireman: Hooray! [SpongeBob shrinks and burns into a black sponge while Mr. Krabs scrapes him off the grill and on to a spatula] Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, come into me office. [Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs office] Mr. Krabs: What's wrong, boy? SpongeBob: Well, I... Mr. Krabs: This is the fourth time this week I've had to scrape you off of something. SpongeBob: Well, I've been thinking. Mr. Krabs: We need to get you thinking about work. [stretches his eyes out] SpongeBob: No offense, Mr. Krabs, but I've been thinking about giving up my cold industrial life in favor of a more natural and free life among the jellyfish. [Mr. Krabs's eyes suck back in, and his eyes now stick back up as normal] Mr. Krabs: [laughs a very long time. Cut to an aerial view of the Krusty Krab, then back to inside the kitchen.] Ah, SpongeBob, you wouldn't last even one day in the wild. This is your natural habitat. [shows the kitchen] This is your wide open range. [shows the grill] These are your amber waves. [shows the greasy fryers] And this? [picks up a spatula from the sink] Oh, this is your golden scepter, with which you rule! Well, that's better than nasty old jellyfish, right, SpongeBob? [SpongeBob is gone. Mr. Krabs looks around his head.] SpongeBob? SpongeBob: [walks out the Krusty Krab] I can too last more than one day. I'll show him. Aw, barnacles! [throws his hat on the ground] Mr. Krabs: [opens the doors] SpongeBob, wait! [sees SpongeBob's hat on the ground and gasps, revealing the hat has been dropped] Oh, he'll be back, alright. He'll be back. [The scene fades to SpongeBob's neighborhood. SpongeBob is now giving his stuff away to his friends Patrick and Squidward.] SpongeBob: And, Squidward, I want you to have my can opener. [gives it to him] Squidward: And I thought this friendship would never pay off. [walks away] Patrick: [teary-eyed] Are-are-are-are you sure you want to give me this mayonnaise? [shows him the jar of mayonnaise] SpongeBob: It's all yours. [Patrick holds up a bunch of phone books] Patrick: A-a-and these old phone books? SpongeBob: All yours, old friend. [walks off and comes back with a case] Patrick, there is one more thing I want you to have. [Opens up a rectangular box that has the words \"Ol' Reliable\" on the front. A glowing jellyfish net is inside. Patrick gasps and pants with excitement as he throws the phone books away and picks up Ol' Reliable] Patrick: Oh! O-o-ol' Reliable? [cries as Sandy walks up] Sandy: Howdy, y'all. Hey, SpongeBob, you having a garage sale? SpongeBob: No, Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish. Sandy: SpongeBob, of all the crazy schemes. Why would you want to live among the jellyfish? They're cold and mean and none too bright. [SpongeBob pats Sandy's helmet] SpongeBob: Oh, oh, Sandy. That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived. I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy. [walks away] Maybe someday you'll wise up and join me. Goodbye. [walks behind a bush and takes his pants off] I won't be needing these. [drops his pants and runs away] Buzz, buzz, buzz. Buzz, buzz, buzz. [His friends see SpongeBob's actions: Patrick clearly upset, shaking himself, Squidward feeling indifferent, and Sandy feeling concerned.] Squidward: He took off his pants. Sandy: I'll give him a week. [walks away] Squidward: I'll give him eleven minutes. [walks away, throwing off the can opener at Patrick.] Patrick: Patrick sad! [The scene cuts to Jellyfish Fields. SpongeBob touches the Jellyfish Fields sign.] SpongeBob: I'm...home. I'm home! I'm home! I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home! [jellyfish knock SpongeBob down as they fly by] Brothers and sisters, wait for me! [jellyfish fly into a hive] Buzz buzz. Buzz buzz. Okay, I'm here! [jellyfish fly out of hive] Wait, I just got here. My jellyfish instincts tell me to go... [sticks his finger in his mouth and then in his head] ...that way. [points to where the jellyfish went] Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. Buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz. [running after jellyfish all over the fields. Jellyfish devour a bunch of kelp. SpongeBob decides to try it but is disgusted and spits it out from his tongue] This is the life. [notices jellyfish are floating in the middle of the fields and SpongeBob starts walking into the middle of the group] Hey, everybody, buzz buzz. B-buzz to you. Buzz, buzz, nice current today. Hey, what's the buzz? [wants to shake a jellyfish's hand] Hello, I'm JellyBob, and you are? [the jellyfish stings his hand] Uhh... nice to meet you. [hand gets huge and swollen, and the jellyfish flies away. SpongeBob smells some aroma and goes to check and see that Patrick and Sandy are having a picnic with Krabby Patties] Sandy: Here, Patrick, have a Krabby Patty! [whispers into Patrick's ear] There he is, Patrick. Say your line. Patrick: [reading off his script] \"Why, thank you, Sandy, I would love one. (take patty).\" [takes the patty] \"Too bad SpongeBob isn't here. These are his favorites. I sure wish he'd come home. (take bite).\" [sniffles. tries to take a bite, but throws the patty and the script away and turns to SpongeBob] I can't do it! SpongeBob! Come back! SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm not coming home. Patrick: I miss you! [cut to Sandy waving hello, but in guilty manner because of set-up] Sandy misses you! Even Squidward misses you! [Cut to Squidward throwing himself a party at his home.] Squidward: Whoopee! Ha ha! Yeah! Ha ha! Ha! Heh! Ha-ha-cha! [Cut back to Jellyfish Fields.] SpongeBob: I'm happy here. This is my home now. [Sandy drags Patrick away] Patrick: No! SpongeBob! [Bubble transition to the jellyfish wiggling their arms and legs. SpongeBob comes in and follows their patterns.] SpongeBob: Hey, everybody! I'm back! I think I'm getting the hang of this. [Jellyfish float away as the net is swung at SpongeBob, which knocks him down. Out of nowhere, Patrick, breathing heavily in anger, is ready to capture SpongeBob with Ol' Reliable] SpongeBob: Patrick! What are you doing? Patrick: [eyes tearing] If I can't have you as a friend, I'm gonna make you a trophy! [Violently swings his jellyfish net once, as if to catch a jellyfish. He then shows a jar with a label on the front that reads \"SpongeBob - Friend\"] I even picked out this nice jar for you! [shows SpongeBob the jar] SpongeBob: Patrick! Go home! I'm a jellyfish now! [Patrick swings the net at SpongeBob but SpongeBob runs away. Patrick does a war cry. After hearing Patrick's war cry, SpongeBob runs away and hides behind a rock while breathing heavily but the rock is actually a giant snail's shell.] Rock snail: Meow. [slithers away] [SpongeBob flees from the roaring Patrick. Patrick continues making a war cry and then begins chases SpongeBob. SpongeBob then hides behind a rock] Patrick: I can see you there! [SpongeBob hides behind a bush] I still see you! [SpongeBob hides behind another rock] You're gonna look good on my mantel! [SpongeBob continues fleeing from Patrick] Friends forever, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob runs underneath an arch rock and gasps for oxygen. He spots Patrick underneath the rock on the top] Patrick: [savaged look] I got you now, SpongeBob! [falls on the ground and misses SpongeBob] SpongeBob: Patrick! No! [Patrick runs after SpongeBob again as SpongeBob jumps into the jellyfish hive. Patrick tries to get the hive down with the net, but he can't reach it. He vainly tries to jump to reach the hive, to no avail.] Patrick: Okay! So this is the way it's gonna be. I hope you're happy! [snaps the net in half over his knee and walks away, sobbing] SpongeBob: Well, that's over. Back to jellyfish matters. [a drop of jelly lands on SpongeBob nose. He samples it] Mmm, jelly. [eats a lot of jelly as the jellyfish come back toward the hive] Ah, my jellyfish brethren are returning! [jellyfish buzz into the hive] Greetings, comrades! [The jellyfish repeatedly sting SpongeBob and he screams. SpongeBob climbs out of the hive with several bites and runs as the jellyfish keep stinging him.] [Later at night, SpongeBob is in a cave. He sits isolated, full of blisters, all blue from coldness, and accompanied only by some grass.] SpongeBob: [feeling burnt out emotionally] Being a jellyfish sure is fun. Buzz. [rips off a bushel of grass] Buzz. [pushes a rock over as he uses it for his pillow] Buzz. [pushes the rock aside and gets cold. The blanket scrunches up, but SpongeBob pushes it back down. The blanket scrunches up again and SpongeBob gets cold] Hey! Eww, I'm itchy! Itchy, why am I so itchy? [takes off the blanket and reveals nine poison sea urchins] [screams] Poison sea urchins! [SpongeBob screams and scratches the urchins off of him and runs out of the cave to scratch off against a rocky stalagmite.] SpongeBob: Ow, ow, oh, itches. Ow, ow, itches. [Continues speaking in pain, and crawls on the ground to stop the itching.] [Later, SpongeBob is walking home, back to Bikini Bottom, at night] SpongeBob: Buzz. Buzz. Buzz. [says \"Buzz\" fourteen more times as he walks up to the Krusty Krab door with a \"Closed\" sign and sees a plate full of Krabby Patties on a table] Krabby Patties. Buzz. Buzz. [walks past Sandy's treedome, then he sniffles] Sandy. [still saying \"Buzz,\" walks up to his pineapple] What have I done? I had a great life and friends, and I gave all of that up. [SpongeBob opens the door. The light turns on. Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Squidward, Patrick, and Gary are there to welcome him home] Mr. Krabs, Patrick, and Sandy: Welcome home, SpongeBob! [Squidward blows a party blower] SpongeBob: You guys are the best! I made a huge mistake. Please forgive me! Mr. Krabs: Ah, quit your blubbering and have a Krabby Patty. [hands him a Krabby Patty] SpongeBob: Don't mind if I do. [eats it as Mr. Krabs places his Krusty Crew hat on his head] Mr. Krabs: And I'll see you at work first thing tomorrow morning. SpongeBob: [salutes] Aye, aye, captain! Squidward: SpongeBob, do us all a favor. [hands SpongeBob his pants] SpongeBob: Don't mind if I do! [puts on his pants] Ta-dah. [hugs Squidward] Aww. Squidward: Okay, that's enough. [everyone else hugs SpongeBob and Squidward] Gary: Meow. Squidward: Could we please stop this? [everyone stops hugging] Patrick: Patrick itchy! [everyone but SpongeBob starts to scratch themselves and crawl on the floor] SpongeBob: It is great to be home! [The episode ends.]",

        "synopsis": "At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs holds a meeting with his employees, informing them that his daughter Pearl is going to be working at the Krusty Krab during her summer vacation and that she has lots of new ideas to improve the restaurant. Squidward does not like the idea of being told what to do by a teenager, and he and SpongeBob agree to stand up to her to protect their jobs.Pearl soon arrives and SpongeBob's resolution quickly crumbles, adoring the flamboyant new uniform Pearl gives them. After exchanging many ideas, Pearl and SpongeBob agree to turn the Krusty Krab into the \"Kuddly Krab,\" and re-purpose the restaurant into a hip café, all with Mr. Krabs' blessing.Squidward remains the only holdout and shakes the newly designed sign in frustration. Two passersby are disappointed the Krusty Krab is seemingly gone and, thinking Squidward is a woman, ask him where a place to eat is. Enraged, Squidward quits on the spot and rips off his costume.The Kuddly Krab quickly becomes a hit with the teenage crowd. SpongeBob is told to make a salad, which he never heard of, so he makes a Krabby Patty and shows it to Pearl. Disgusted, she orders him to take off the buns and the patty, leaving only tomatoes and lettuce. Upon returning to the kitchen, SpongeBob is horrified to see that his grill is gone. Pearl explains to him that Krabby Patties are no longer \"hip,\" and that they now serve only tea and salad. SpongeBob is then given a humiliating mascot costume to wear out front, which it is very unfair and decided to complain to Mr. Krabs about what Pearl has done.Despite putting on a brave face, Mr. Krabs agrees with SpongeBob's complaints and admits that Pearl's renovations are losing them money. Though Mr. Krabs knows that Pearl needs to go, he can't bring himself to fire his own daughter, so he makes SpongeBob be the one to fire her. SpongeBob calls Pearl into the kitchen, dreading what he has to do. Before he can even say anything, however, Pearl breaks down crying and reveals to SpongeBob that she's really been trying to get herself fired since the beginning and hates working at the restaurant, only taking the job and pretending to like it to please her dad and doesn't want to risk disappointing him by quitting. After hearing all this, SpongeBob comes up with a plan to stage Pearl being fired outside of her dad's office.As Mr. Krabs listens in to the exchange, he debates with himself whether he should allow it to happen. The sight of his empty safe with a spider web finally prompts him to yell to SpongeBob to get on with it, but with the words, \"Pearl, you're fired,\" the strain on Mr. Krabs' heart knocks him out cold. Pearl thanks SpongeBob for letting her go and kisses him on the cheek before dashing off to the mall with her friends.SpongeBob enters Mr. Krabs' office to report his success, only to find him passed out on the floor. After being revived with a $20 bill, Mr. Krabs laments what's been done to Pearl—but SpongeBob assures his boss that Pearl's fine, claiming that she's off to bigger and better things. While he's glad that the situation is resolved, Mr. Krabs wonders how he'll get his money back for all of Kuddly Krabs' decorations/merchandise. SpongeBob buys all of them, costing him one year's salary, and puts them in his house for his enjoyment, while Gary is uncomfortable.",

        "transcript": "[At the Krusty Krab, Squidward is at the ordering boat and SpongeBob is looking out from the ordering window. Mr. Krabs' voice sounds on the P.A.] Mr. Krabs: Attention! Attention! All Krusty Krew employees, attention! [stands next to them, speaking into a megaphone] Get the anchors out of your pants and report to me office! [pause] That will be all. [Squidward and SpongeBob follow Mr. Krabs into his office and sit down] I have an important announcement to make. SpongeBob: Whoo! Hooray! [jumps up on top of the chair and twirls it around] The new spatulas are here! Mr. Krabs: Sit down, boy! There's no new spatulers! Squidward: [sarcastically] How disappointing. Mr. Krabs: You men know me daughter Pearl. She's growing up fast. [looks at a picture of Pearl and Mr. Krabs in swim attire jumping up from the water] It seems like it was just yesterday I was teaching her how to breach. Me mammalian angel. Erm, uh... [puts the picture back on the wall] Anyway, uh, so she's going to be working here during her summer vacation. She's got a lot of fresh ideas to bring in some hungry customers! [a bell rings] Pearl: [off-screen] Hello? Daddy?! Mr. Krabs: Thar she blows! [leaves the room] Squidward: SpongeBob, do you realize what this means? SpongeBob: No new spatulas? Squidward: No! It means some bratty teenager's coming in here to tell us what to do. We can't have that! We have seniority, right? SpongeBob: Right! [he and Squidward shake hands] Squidward: So, we'll work together to protect our pathetic positions. SpongeBob: Okey-dokey, Squidward. And then we'll get those new spatulas. Mr. Krabs: [pokes his head into the office] All right, men. [SpongeBob and Squidward walk out of the office] Say hello to me Pearl. SpongeBob: Hello, pole. [hugs one of the giant pillars] Pearl: [holding a box] Hi, guys. Mr. Krabs: It makes me jolly as a roger to have you finally aboard the family business. Pearl: Great, Dad, because I have so many new ideas. Mr. Krabs: [sniffs the air and his eyes conjoin to make a dollar sign shape] I can smell the money already! I'll be in me office if you need me. [walks off] SpongeBob: What's in the box? Pearl: It's a surprise. SpongeBob: I like surprises. Pearl: Great, then close your eyes. SpongeBob: [covers his eyes with his hands] I'm ready! [Pearl puts the box's open end over SpongeBob] Squidward: Well, I like it so far. Pearl: [Pearl lifts up the box] Ta-dah. [Squidward gasps. The body suit is pink with purple flowers and on the top are two K's being held up by springs.] It's the new Krusty Krew uniform. I designed it myself. [hands SpongeBob a mirror] Squidward: Okay, this is it, SpongeBob. Now tell her how you really feel about that uniform. SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward. [winks to him] Pearl... this is the greatest uniform ever! Squidward: Fish paste. Pearl: Oh, SpongeBob, you look so adorable. I could just eat you up. SpongeBob: Sorry, Pearl, this item's not on the menu. [giggles] Squidward: Well, I didn't think it was possible, SpongeBob, but you look even more ridiculous than usual. Pearl: Don't be jealous, Uncle Squiddy. I made one for you, too. [Squidward holds up his uniform] Squidward: Don't bother. Only a fool would wear that. Mr. Krabs: [bursts out of his office, wearing the uniform] Avast, ye shipmates! Don't these just shiver your timbers? [laughs, then shuts the door, then peeks his head out] Get that suit on, sailor. It's already been paid for. Squidward: [with the uniform on. The two springs give and the K's fall over Squidward's eyes] Rage. Fury. Irritation. Humiliation. Pearl: Squidward is such a barnacle. SpongeBob: A stick in the sand. Pearl: But not you, SpongeBob. You are full of style. SpongeBob: Me? Really? Pearl: Totally, S.B. You ooze fashion. And I've got some completely coral concepts for this old joint, and I'm going to need someone with your kind of talent to help me. SpongeBob: Well, I have been trying to get Mr. Krabs to make some changes around here. [looks at a picture he drew of Mr. Krabs, himself and Squidward with mustaches] Pearl: Why, with my girlish instincts, and your, um... sponginess, [cut to a view of the Krusty Krab as a deserted place, where a skeleton is sitting at a table] we'll turn this worn-out lunch wagon into a teenage paradise. Pearl: [cut to Pearl with a notepad, thinking] SpongeBob, what do you like better? The Kutie Krab or the Kooky Krab? Squidward: [runs over] For what, dare I ask? Pearl: The new name for our new look. I mean, \"The Krusty Krab\" has got to go. Who wants to eat at a place they think is crusty? [makes a raspberry] Blech! [sticks out her tongue and points the pencil towards it to show disgust] Squidward: Well, sure it's a terrible name, but this is a terrible place. Therefore, the name should be left alone. Right, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: I got it! How about The Khaotic Krab? Pearl: Hmm... how about The Kissy Krab? [puckers up her lips and makes kissing noises] SpongeBob: [in royal attire] The King Krab? Pearl: [holds up a lollipop, which bears an odd resemblance to her father] The Kandy Krab! SpongeBob: [dressed as a jazzy beatnik] The Kool Krab. [dresses as a cowboy riding a stick horse] Or the Kowboy Krab! [appears totally stretched out] The Kurly Krab. [appears as a mad scientist holding a brain with crab-like arms coming from it] The Kreepy Krab. [appears as a crazy killer jungle man with a loincloth and shouts scarily] The Killer Krab! Pearl: [freaked out, gasps] No! SpongeBob: You're right, too scary. [they both think and finally get the name] SpongeBob and Pearl: The Kuddly Krab! [both happily hug and laugh. A rainbow of colors fills the screen. Pearl, SpongeBob and an anguished Squidward stand outside the new restaurant. The sign for the restaurant is now a heart and a cutesy robot Krabs is waving his arms atop it. The restaurant outside itself is tie-dyed with colors and rainbows and the flags are now hearts. Balloons are hanging from the roof and giant lollipops come from the chimney. Pearl and SpongeBob, giggling, walk back in the restaurant. Squidward is so mad that the two K's on his uniform catch on fire and he shakes the pole. Incidental 22 and Fred drive by in a car.] Incidental 22: It's a shame old man Krabs sold the Krusty Krab. Fred: That's a darn shame. Hey, lady! Do you know where we can get something to eat around here? Squidward: That's it! I quit! [rips off his uniform, revealing nothing under it. A police whistle is blown and Incidental 118 comes over and writes him a ticket for indecent exposure and places it between his legs. Inside the restaurant, it's a total makeover, like Pearl said before, it's a teenage paradise] Incidental 11: Finally! A cool place for teens to just, you know, hang out. [Pearl and SpongeBob admire their restaurant] SpongeBob: Pearl, you're a genius. All these young, hip new customers. Phooey on Squidward. He can't keep up with the times. You're a true visionary, Pearl. Pearl: Thank you, SpongeBob. I do have 20/20 vision. [blinks bashfully] SpongeBob: Well, hip people have to eat, too. Back to the grill. [is in the kitchen at the grill] The customers may be hot, but my grill is hotter. [pushes his spatula on the grill and imitates a sizzle] Pearl: [in the ordering window to hand SpongeBob an order] SpongeBob, order up! SpongeBob: Two... sa- lads. Never heard of it. [gasp] I got to stay hip. I don't want to end up like silly old Squidward. But what in the name of Davy Jones' locker is a [pronounces it wrong] sa- lad? [Bubble transition to SpongeBob walking up to Pearl with a tray with two Krabby Patties] Here you go. Two sa- lads. Pearl: Ew, gross. Those aren't salads. Take those back. Remove the bun, the patty and the condiments. SpongeBob: But that leaves just lettuce and tomato. Pearl: Exactly. SpongeBob: All right. [walks back to the kitchen and sadly removes the top bun] Okay, no buns. That's hip. [removes the bottom buns and top buns] No patties, [removes the patties] happenin'. [crushed] Oh, yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I ever saw. Incidental 46: This is so cool! SpongeBob: [walks over with a tray of salads to Incidental 46 and Incidental 7 at a table, who are talking] Two salads. [drops the tray on the table and walks back to the kitchen] That was awful. I hope I never have to tear apart a perfectly good Krabby Patty ever again. I don't think my heart can take it. [screams, noticing the grill is gone] Where's the grill? Pearl: Come on, SpongeBob, you're a hip guy. You know fried foods are O-U-T, out. SpongeBob: Uh... right on. Pearl: Check out this new menu I came up with. [SpongeBob takes the menu] SpongeBob: [reading it] Salad and tea. But where are the Krabby Patties? Pearl: Oh, silly, those aren't hip. Oh, you won't be needing that thing anymore. [takes the spatula from SpongeBob. He starts to stutter] I've got something more fun for you to do anyway. [cut to SpongeBob outside the restaurant in a crab suit, waving at cars. One car with Incidental 27 stops] Incidental 27: Hey, buddy, you need a ride? I was just on my way to the big doofus convention. [laughs and drives off] SpongeBob: This is humiliating. I'm a fry cook, darn it! You can take away my spatula, but when you take away my dignity, that's when I get mad! I'm going to march right into Mr. Krabs' office and tell him this is just too much! [walks toward the restaurant, but gravity gets the best of him and he falls over. He struggles to get up and starts to whimper. Cut to SpongeBob at Mr. Krabs' door, outside the costume.] Okay, SpongeBob, you can do this. Come on... [knocks on the door and peeks in] Mr. Krabs, could I talk to you? [Mr. Krabs' office is just as elaborately decorated as the rest of the restaurant] Mr. Krabs: Come on in, me boy. Have a seat. SpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs. [sits down in a bear bean bag chair, but starts to sink inside it] Mr. Krabs: Don't you just love me new office? Pearly designed it for me. SpongeBob: [has sunk in, now you can only see his eye] Mr. Krabs, um, I think we've got a problem. Mr. Krabs: Isn't that the neatest $40 chair you ever sat in? SpongeBob: [has totally sunk into the chair and he sticks out his hand] Sure, Mr. Krabs, but I've got some bad news. Mr. Krabs: How about my cuddly executive buddy? [picks up a blue stress-relief doll] Reduces stress for only five easy payments of $9.95. [squeezes it as its eyes, nose and ears pop out] SpongeBob: [pops out of the chair] Mr. Krabs, Pearl is ruining the Krusty Krab! [covers his mouth] Mr. Krabs: What?! Why, Pearl is saving the Krusty Krab! I mean, the Kuddly Krab. [goes over to a picture of a seahorse] What would we do without these beautiful $20 sea unicorn wall hangers? [goes to a strand of lights] How could we have ever survive without these $35 heart lights? How could we go on without a sea fern on every last table?! [holds one up] It's hip! It's coral! It's... it's losing money! [starts to cry] Oh, you're right, SpongeBob. But I can't fire me pride and joy. It would break her fragile little heart! What am I going to do? SpongeBob: There, there, Mr. Krabs. I'm sure there's another way. Mr. Krabs: That's it, boy! SpongeBob: What's it? Mr. Krabs: You could fire her! It's okay if she hates you. SpongeBob: That's not what I said, sir. [Mr. Krabs brings SpongeBob to the door] Mr. Krabs: Great then, it's all settled: you fire Pearly, I'll hide in me office. [SpongeBob is pushed out the door and accidentally runs into Pearl] Pearl: Totally rude, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Pearl, could I see you in the kitchen for a second? Pearl: Sure, SpongeBob. [they walk to the kitchen] SpongeBob: [thinking] How am I going to break it to her? I've never fired anyone before. I just got to say it. Pearl, you're fired! Okay, here it goes. [opens his mouth to say it, but Pearl is already crying] Pearl: [crying] Oh, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob lets out a sigh of some relief] Pearl: I can't take it anymore! Nothing I do is working! SpongeBob: Sure it is, Pearl. Look at all the hip, young people eating sa- lads! Pearl: No, don't you get it?! I've been trying to get fired since day one! I was only pretending to like this place to please Daddy. This job is cutting majorly into my social life. Oh, SpongeBob, what should I do? SpongeBob: [thinks for a second] I've got it! I could pretend to [air quotes] \"fire you.\" I'll take the heat from old man Krabs later. Pearl: [grabs SpongeBob in a bone-snapping hug] Gosh, you'd really do that for me? You're a great pal, SpongeBob. How can I ever thank you? SpongeBob: [muffled] Stop trying to break me in half? Pearl: [drops him] Deal. [cut to SpongeBob and Pearl walking up to Mr. Krabs' door, Pearl tries to conceal her laughing] Oh, boy, oh, boy! SpongeBob: Okay, Pearl. We got to make this convincing. [loud and clear] Pearl, I need to have a word with you. [we see Mr. Krabs in his office, sobbing] Mr. Krabs: Oh no, here it goes! I don't know if I can bear to listen. SpongeBob: It's not that you haven't done a good job around here, it's just that... Mr. Krabs: [now pushed against the door] Don't be too hard on her, now. Why does it have to be in this way? [sees himself in the uniform in the mirror] It's for the best. SpongeBob: Well, we feel it might be in everybody's best interest if... Mr. Krabs: I can't let him do this! [goes for the door, then sees the vault open. It's empty, and a spider crawls around its web] Get on with it, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Pearl, you're fired. [Mr. Krabs chokes and falls over] Pearl: [whispers] Thanks, SpongeBob. [kisses him, then runs off and jumps into a car with all her friends] Come on, gang, the mall awaits! [they drive off. SpongeBob runs into the office] SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, I did it! [screams when he sees Mr. Krabs' body. He runs over to a bill behind glass, which is for emergency purposes and he breaks the glass. He waves the bill under Mr. Krabs' nose.] Mr. Krabs: [regaining consciousness] Oh, Pearly... [sniffs] Is that a $20? [pockets the bill] Oh, SpongeBob, how could we have done such a thing to me own flesh and blood? [cries] SpongeBob: There, there, Mr. Krabs. Pearl took it just fine, in fact, she seemed kind of happy. Mr. Krabs: Really? SpongeBob: She's off to bigger and better things. Mr. Krabs: That's me girl; tough as nails, just like her old man! [laughs] But how am I gonna get my money back for all this stuff? [SpongeBob thinks. Cut to his house, where all the stuff is put up in his house. SpongeBob dances in his uniform to the music] SpongeBob: [laughing] Isn't this great, Gary? And it only cost me one year's salary! Gary: [covered in stuffed animals and his shell has flowers painted on it] Meow?",

        "synopsis": "One night, Squidward has a dream that he is dressed in island clothes and playing the piano on an island. He hits one of the notes, but it makes a bell sound, which is coming from SpongeBob hitting a bell, which in reality is his alarm clock going off revealing that it was a bad dream. Later in the morning, Squidward is still thinking about the nightmare about SpongeBob he had while arriving at the Krusty Krab, where it is Employee Brotherhood Day, a day on which all employees must exchange gifts that they made themselves. For his gift to Squidward, SpongeBob presents him with a sweater made out of his own eyelashes. When Squidward scoffs at this heartfelt gift, SpongeBob begins to cry copiously, eventually handing Squidward a sweater made from his own tears.Squidward, wishing he could simply buy a gift instead of spending time on making one, finds a group of pirates outside with a sack of pies. The pirates claim that these were bombs and Squidward laments on being unable to purchase one, causing the pirates to lie and withdraw their claim and he is given an indeterminate flavor for $25. Squidward presents his supposedly homemade pie to Mr. Krabs, who decides to give it a taste test. He breaks a tiny bit off the crust and goes to get milk. Tripping on his way, the crumb of pie explodes on contact and wrecks the back of the Krusty Krab, blasting Squidward and Mr. Krabs away. While Mr. Krabs believes it to be a deliberate attempt on his life, Squidward confesses that he bought the pie, ignorant of its contents. Back in Mr. Krabs' office, SpongeBob discovers the \"pie\" that Squidward bought for him not noticing the large hole.After Squidward explains how he got the bomb to Mr. Krabs, they realize that the bomb is still in the Krusty Krab. When they rush back to the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob has apparently eaten the entire pie. Mr. Krabs is disgusted at Squidward for his act and asks how he will live with himself for \"killing\" SpongeBob after all of the nice things the sponge did for him. Squidward then imagines SpongeBob serving food to a customer, only to then suddenly explode into many small cubes from eating the explosive pie. Horrified, Squidward suggests they get him to the hospital to remove it, but Mr. Krabs states that it will not do any good. Having seen this situation play out eleven times prior, he tells Squidward that the pie will explode upon reaching SpongeBob's lower intestine. Squidward still tries to call the hospital, but the doctor reveals to have seen this situation eleven times before as well and cannot save him. A guilt-ridden Squidward laments on SpongeBob's fate and asks how he will tell him. Mr. Krabs insists that Squidward does not tell him, as it will only make him feel worse. He then predicts to Squidward that SpongeBob has only until sunset to live before the bomb hits his lower intestine and says that he should enjoy his final hours. Truly remorseful, Squidward decides to come up with a plan to make SpongeBob's remaining hours the most fun he has ever had, and so he asks him what he would most like to do. SpongeBob presents an extensive list of exactly that. He calls it his \"friendship list.\" A montage of Squidward and SpongeBob playing together is shown, revealing that Squidward has forgotten about Mr. Krabs' warning, SpongeBob's gifts to him, Employee Brotherhood Day, and his dream about SpongeBob.The final activity SpongeBob planned is watching the sunset with Squidward. Remembering Mr. Krabs' warning about SpongeBob's death, Squidward nervously agrees to participate. As they sit facing the setting sun, SpongeBob casually notes the brick wall Squidward has built between them. SpongeBob then mentions that if he were to die, \"in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend,\" this sunset would be exactly what he would want to see. Squidward begins to tear up at this while SpongeBob lets out a small burp, saying something of indeterminate flavor just hit his lower intestine. With the sun nearly past the horizon, SpongeBob begins a five-second countdown, letting Squidward finish the count. At the end of the first count, with the sun still visible, SpongeBob chuckles that they may have started too early. Squidward, increasingly nervous, begins counting down once more. When he hits \"three,\" the sun finally sets, and an explosion rocks the wall. Squidward breaks down into tears, thankful he was at least able to make SpongeBob's last few hours meaningful.Another explosion occurs, which knocks the wall down, crushing Squidward. He pulls himself out from underneath and, to his bewilderment, finds SpongeBob alive as well and blowing bubble bombs. Enraged, Squidward angrily yells at SpongeBob, saying that he spent the whole day with him doing all kinds of ridiculous things because he was supposed to explode. SpongeBob thought at first that Squidward wants him to \"explode\" in anger. That wasn't the case. Squidward said he was supposed to explode into a million pieces. After SpongeBob asks why, Squidward explains to him about the pie he left sitting on the counter at The Krusty Krab that he bought from pirates for 25 bucks and he didn't know it was a bomb, and that SpongeBob ate it. SpongeBob finally knows what Squidward was talking about, because he remembers he was saving the pie in his back pocket for them to share. SpongeBob then walks over to share the pie with Squidward, only to trip on a rock. The pie bomb splats into Squidward, and the entirety of Bikini Bottom is destroyed in a nuclear explosion. Squidward miraculously survives, uttering \"Ouch\" in pain.",

        "transcript": "[The episode begins with Dream Squidward, dressed in island clothes, playing the piano on an island. He hits one of the notes, but it makes a bell sound so he keeps hitting it to double-check. The sound is coming from Dream SpongeBob hitting a bell.] Dream SpongeBob: Order up, Squidward! [Squidward wakes up from his dream while his alarm clock goes off. Bubble transition to Squidward driving to work. Zooms in on one of his bumper stickers that reads \"Don't Ask Me About My Day.\" Squidward blearily looks up from his steering wheel to prepare himself for the day ahead. He puts his Krusty Krab employee hat and retains a tired expression. He walks up to the front doors and SpongeBob follows him from inside, smiling. Squidward walks inside.] SpongeBob: Hey, hey, Squidward, did you see me? [Squidward walks inside without saying a word] Okay, see you later, Squidinator. Mr. Krabs: Good morning, Mr. Squidward! [raises his eyebrows; Squidward sticks out his tongue] So, are ya ready? Squidward: To go home...? Mr. Krabs: No, to exchange gifts for Employee Brotherhood Day. Squidward: Mr. Krabs, you pay me to stand behind this register and take orders and give change. But you could never pay me enough to act brotherly towards... [points at SpongeBob] ... that guy! [SpongeBob is washing a table with a buffer, then scrubs his face and gets it scrambled and laughs] Mr. Krabs: That attitude of yours is precisely why we're having this little shenanigan! Now pay attention! The lad's got a surprise for ye. SpongeBob: Squidward, in honor of Employee Brotherhood, I present to you a gift! [holds up a sweater] Ta-dah! [zooms in to show it's a picture of a heart with Squidward's face on it] Squidward: \"I Heart you...\" Mr. Krabs: Try it on, Mr. Squidward! It's got \"you\" written all over it! [laughs as Squidward has a hard time putting the sweater over his head] SpongeBob: I wasn't sure how big to make the hole for the head, so I used a watermelon for size! [Squidward gets the sweater over his head] Do you love it? Squidward: [starts scratching the sweater] It's a little itchy. What's this thing made of? [cut to SpongeBob with no eyelashes or eyebrows] SpongeBob: Eyelashes! [a disgusted Squidward throws the sweater at SpongeBob, causing him to whimper] Squidward: Now, may I resume to my minimum-wage duties? Mr. Krabs: After you present your brotherhood gift. Squidward: I'll buy the little twerp a gumball. Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, no, no, no, lad. You know the rules; you have to make the gift. Squidward: [walks to the doors] The only thing I'm making is for the exit. [opens up the door to see SpongeBob crying with a new sweater made out of a clear liquid] SpongeBob: Is this any better, Squidward? I made this one with my tears... [sniffles. Squidward sighs and walks towards the kitchen] Mr. Krabs: I knew you'd come around, boy. Make something nice. Squidward: Why can't I just buy something for the little weirdo? Captain: Heave-ho! [Squidward looks out from the window and sees some pirates outside carrying some pies onto the ship] If you drop one single slice of me booty, I'll have... your booty! Squidward: [walks outside and talks politely to the pirates] Uh... hi, there. Those, uh, homemade pies sure look good. Pirate: Oh, these aren't homemade, they were made in a factory... a bomb factory... they're bombs. Squidward: Oh, well, that's too bad. I thought they were pies and I wanted to buy one. [holds up money] Captain: Wait! [jumps down off the ship] We were just kidding about all that bomb stuff. That'll be 25 bucks, please. Squidward: So, what flavor is it? Pirates: [all talking at once] Cherry. Apple. Raspberry. Squidward: Well, if it'll get old man Mr. Krabs off my back. [gives the captain the money; the captain runs off happily. Cut to Squidward placing the pie on Mr. Krabs' desk] Okay, here it is, Mr. Krabs, fresh from the oven. I'll be returning to my life now. Mr. Krabs: Not yet. I gotta make sure ya did it right. [grabs a piece of the pie. He is about to put a piece in his mouth] Wait a second, this would go great with some milk! [while walking to the milk, he trips over a book and the piece of pie flies into the milk, causing an explosion, sending both Squidward and Mr. Krabs out of the Krusty Krab] So, ya tried to kill me over a little new-age management, eh? Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs, I had no idea! I can explain! [cut to inside Mr. Krabs' office] SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, are you okay? I heard a-- Wow! A pie! [looks at the card attached to it] It's from Squidward! [reading] \"To SpongeBob... Well, here ya go.\" Squidward: And that's what happened! Mr. Krabs: 25 dollars?! A bomb?! Squidward and Mr. Krabs: [shouting] In the Krusty Krab?! [both run back into the office, but the pie is not there] Mr. Krabs: That's where you left it! Squidward: It's not there! SpongeBob: Hey, guys! [licks and kisses his fingers five times then rubs his tummy] Thanks for the pie, Squidward! [sings] La-la-la-la-la-la-la... [skips out] Mr. Krabs: Ya had to kill 'im. The boy cries ya a sweater of tears... and you kill 'im. How are you gonna live with yourself? Squidward: Kill him?! [imagines Dream SpongeBob taking a tray to a customer] Dream SpongeBob: Here's your order, sir! Dream Customer: Thanks. [Dream SpongeBob explodes and pieces of him fly everywhere; back to reality] Squidward: Aah! No, no! Well, we got... we got to call the hospital! Mr. Krabs: Won't do any good. I've seen this before. When that pie goes up to bat, I mean, hits his lower intestine... boom! Squidward: You've seen this before?! Mr. Krabs: 11 times as a matter o' fact. [Squidward runs over to a phone and dials the hospital] Squidward: Yes, hello, doctor? Hospital? It won't do any good? 11 times?! [hangs up] Oh, he's a goner. How do we tell him? [both look out the window and see SpongeBob cheerfully wiping off a table, apparently having forgotten about the incident from earlier] Mr. Krabs: Don't tell him. That'll only make him feel worse. [peeks at SpongeBob cleaning a table while singing happily] The way I see it, he's only got till sunset. Why ruin his last day on earth? The lad deserves to enjoy his final hours. [walks away] Squidward: [tears up] You're right, Mr. Krabs! [cries] I'm gonna make SpongeBob's final hours the best he's ever had! And this time, there's gonna be love! So much, he's gonna drown in it! [opens the door then turns around, smiling] Drown in it! [walks out] Mr. Krabs: [writes on a notepad] Note—to—self: Watch out for Squidward. [Cut to Squidward walking over to SpongeBob, who is singing happily and wiping the table] Squidward: Uh, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: [sing-songy] Yes? Squidward: I forgot to tell you, there's a part two to your gift. SpongeBob: Part two? [bounces up and down] Part two, part two, part two, part two... [Squidward grabs him] Squidward: Uh, please, don't do that. SpongeBob: What's the part two? Squidward: Well, what's the most fun thing you can think of? [SpongeBob takes out a list] SpongeBob: Actually, I keep a list of the fun things I like to do. I call it my friendship list. Squidward: Great. Uh, let me see it. [looks at the list] SpongeBob: The things that are extra fun, I've written in red. Squidward: Everything's in red. SpongeBob: Yeah, I know. Squidward: We'd better start now if we wanna get through this list before ya die... of anticipation. SpongeBob: Then let's roll! [both walk out of the Krusty Krab] Bye, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs cries, puts a \"Help Wanted\" sign in the window, and continues crying while he walks off] Heads up, Squidward. Looks like they're gonna replace ya. Squidward: Uh, yeah. Let's take a look at that list. SpongeBob: Well, the first thing I wanna do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town. [bubble transition to SpongeBob and Squidward talking to a businessman] Hi, there, this is my best friend, Squidward. [cut to SpongeBob and Squidward talking to some kids] Hey, kids, check it out! This is my best friend, Squidward. [one of the kids throws a rock at Squidward's head. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward walking up to a fish sitting on a bench] Hi, I wanna show you my best friend, Squidward. Squidward: Hey, Frank. [bubble transition] Glad that's over. SpongeBob: Good, 'cause we're onto our next activity. Squidward: Which is...? SpongeBob: I'm gonna show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town wearing a salmon suit. Squidward: You're gonna be wearing a salmon suit? SpongeBob: [laughs] That's a good one, Squidward! [bubble transition to Squidward in a salmon suit in front of some kids. All the kids throw rocks at him. Cut to SpongeBob checking off the item on his list] Next... [he and Squidward sit by a rock] Knock-knock jokes! Hey, Squid, knock-knock! Squidward: Who's there? SpongeBob: I am! [laughs] Squidward: [laughs weakly] Oh, yeah... [SpongeBob checks the knock-knock jokes off his list. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward walking backwards] SpongeBob: [imitates the beeping of a back up alarm] Look out, everyone, friends in reverse! [continues beeping. SpongeBob checks off this item off the list. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward making noises with their tongues out of their mouths while moving their hands back and forth in front of their face. SpongeBob checks the item off his list. Cut to Squidward walking with SpongeBob as his face] SpongeBob: Turn left, and... stop. See, that's what it'd be like if you had me for a face. Squidward: [muffled] I can't breathe. [SpongeBob checks that off his list. Cut to SpongeBob performing open-heart surgery on Squidward] Squidward: Are you sure you should be poking it like that? SpongeBob: Who's the doctor here? [Squidward's heart squirts blood. SpongeBob checks his operation off the list as well as some other items while he laughs] The last thing on the list is... Squidward: [with a bandage over his heart] Does it involve more dismemberment? SpongeBob: Watch the sunset with Squidward. Squidward: Sunset?! [thinks about what Mr. Krabs said earlier in a thought balloon] Mr. Krabs: The way I see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine. SpongeBob: Hey, it's Mr. Krabs! Hi, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs cries and runs off] Okay, see ya later. Squidward: C'mon, buddy, you want a sunset? You'll get a sunset. [Bubble transition to the sunset.] SpongeBob: [sighs] Underwater sunsets sure are beautiful, eh, Squidward? Squidward: ...Yeah. SpongeBob: Yeah, this is great, just the three of us. You, me, [a brick wall is shown between the two] ...and this brick wall that you built between us. Squidward: Yeah. [laughs nervously] SpongeBob: Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. What do they make you think of, Squidward? [Squidward imagines SpongeBob laughing and then exploding] Squidward: Explosions... uh, I, I mean, uh... e-erosion! SpongeBob: You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay. [Squidward tears up until he hears a burping sound by SpongeBob] Huh? [SpongeBob burps again] Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine. [smells the aroma] Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry? [the sun starts to go down] Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five... You do the rest, buddy. Squidward: Four... three... two... one... [nothing happens] SpongeBob: I guess we started too early. Let's start again. Squidward: Five... four... three... [an explosion is heard from behind the wall] two! [crying] one! Well, at least I was able to make his last few hours meaningful. [sighs] I am such a good person. [another explosion is seen behind the wall but this time, it knocks the brick wall down with black smoke on top of Squidward, revealing SpongeBob, still alive and well, blowing some bomb-shaped bubbles with black smoke and the bubble explodes] SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, check this out! Squidward: [gets up] What the?! I-I thought you... [babbles angrily] SpongeBob: Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot! Squidward: Why are you still here?! SpongeBob: Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one. [holds up a book that says \"Friends 4 Ever\"] I already filled up this book of ideas! We should be able to finish by January! Squidward: Forget the book! [slaps the book away] I spent the whole day with you, doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to explode! SpongeBob: You want me to explode? Squidward: Yes! That's what I've been waiting for! SpongeBob: Um... okay, I'll try. [grunts and then yells] Gary! You are gonna finish your dessert and you are gonna like it! [laughs] Now it's your turn. Squidward: [yells and stomps on the ground repeatedly] That's not what I meant, you barnacle head! SpongeBob: [claps] Ooh, good one. Squidward: No! You're supposed to explode into a million pieces! [flaps his arms] SpongeBob: Why would I do that? Squidward: Because the pie you ate was a bomb! SpongeBob: What pie? Squidward: The one I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks, and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it, th... that pie! SpongeBob: Pie...? [realizes; takes out the exploding pie from before] Oh, you mean this pie! [Squidward is shocked] I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat! [walks forward and trips on a rock] Oops! [the pie flies into Squidward's face in slow-motion, causing an explosion in Bikini Bottom the size of an atomic bomb] Squidward: [the town is now decimated] Ouch. [fade to black, episode ends]",

        "synopsis": "As the episode begins, Sandy and SpongeBob are peacefully watching the clouds. SpongeBob spies one cloud that looks like a flower, but Sandy points out they all look like flowers all the time. While they relax, they discuss hypothetically climbing the nearby Coral Cliff, until they each casually mention that they would obviously win anyway, due to their respective land and sea-based abilities. They decide to have a race and Sandy takes a head start. Despite his efforts to catch up, SpongeBob loses and challenges Sandy to another race to the Krusty Krab, taking the same head start as Sandy and winning.Upset at SpongeBob's victory, Sandy boasts of the superiority of land creatures to sea creatures, listing the many skills and abilities that she claims sea creatures lack. SpongeBob, joined by Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs, point out things that Sandy cannot do, such as breathing underwater. She then decides to tear off her suit and shatter her helmet. Soon enough, the strain proves too much, and Sandy is forced to use a pickle jar as a makeshift air helmet.To settle the issue, Sandy challenges the group to the reverse: going up on dry land for one minute, which they declare an easy feat. Once they reach the shore of the local island, they lose confidence. Unwilling to let her win, they resolve to charge up to the surface and end up finding the land enjoyable. They even take the time to chat up a pair of native seagulls.After the minute passes, Sandy lets go of her pride and heads up herself to congratulate the group. To her horror, she discovers her friends being chased and mauled by the seagulls and attacks the birds (calling them rats with wings) to save them.With the five friends back on the ocean floor, the two sides come to the realization that everyone, sea and land creature alike, is good at something, even if no one is good at everything. SpongeBob and Sandy apologize to each other (SpongeBob for making Sandy a laughingstock, and Sandy for daring the others into going onto dry land), and the group gives a cheer in honor of feeling sorry for themselves. Meanwhile, the now defeated and plucked seagulls, in a sorry state of their own, halfheartedly join in the cheer as the episode closes.",

Sandy: Yeah. Relax. SpongeBob: Ooh! Ooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like? Sandy: What? SpongeBob: A flower. Sandy: They all look like flowers, SpongeBob. All the time. SpongeBob: They sure do. Sandy: You know, normally, I'd offer to race you to the top of coral cliffs. But I don't want to miss out on a second of this beautiful beauty. SpongeBob: Me either.

SpongeBob: That's funny, Sandy. That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest. Sandy: ’Course I can! I'm a squirrel. See?

I'm from the surface world, and nothin’ prepares you for climbin’ than growin’ up on good ol' dry land.

And I took a head start like you did! Sandy: Well, I was just funnin’ with you that time! But I guess all y'all underwater don't have to play fair! SpongeBob: I guess we don't, air breather! Sandy: Water sucker! SpongeBob: Tree climber! Sandy: Gulf streamer! SpongeBob: Kite flier! Sandy: Chum chewer! SpongeBob: [gasps] Take that back! You- [nervously] not wet person! Sandy: Aha! You can't even come up with another name! That proves it! SpongeBob: Proves what? Sandy: That land critters are better than sea critters! Patrick: [arrives] Better at what? Sandy: Oh, dern near everything, I guess. Cattle ropin’ and pie eatin’ and wood choppin’ and flyin’! Squidward: [appears on screen] What's she blabbering about? Patrick: She says land creatures are best. Sandy: Only 'cause it's true! We're best at horse ridin’ and fur stylin’ and rowin’. Y'all got us licked in swimmin’, but we've got corn shuckin’ [Mr. Krabs joins SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward as well] and hay bailin’’ and barn raisin’... and fishin’! [SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs all gasp.] Sandy: And name callin’, for sure! Squidward: And drowning, don't forget drowning! SpongeBob: [laughing] Good one, Squidward! [jumps to high five Squidward, but freezes in midair] Woo! Squidward: Not on your life, sport. [SpongeBob falls] SpongeBob: I'll admit, you've got some pretty good moves. For a squirrel. [SpongeBob and the rest except Sandy start laughing until SpongeBob signals them to stop] But you're still just a land creature. Sandy: Squirrels can do anything they want to! Patrick: I bet they can't eat a Krabby Double Deluxe in one bite. [gulps a big patty down] Ah. Sandy: [reaches off-screen for the same big patty] Give me that. They don't call me Cheeks for nothin’. [tries to eat it, but it splatters on her air helmet. Everyone, but Sandy, begins to laugh] Patrick: Thank you, thank you. Sandy: Well, that's just one thing. Mr. Krabs: Can you do this? [pops his eyestalks in and out of his head] Everyone in my family can do that. Sandy: [tries to do it] Uh...uh... Squidward: How about this? [balances five spinning plates on a stick with his tentacles] Huh? SpongeBob: Can you reproduce by budding? [begins to do it] Can ya? Can ya? Can ya? Can ya? Sandy: No! SpongeBob: Most importantly...can you do this? [all except Sandy make their eyes big and round, and begin gasping three times without releasing any breath] Sandy: Well, what would I wanna do any of that dumb stuff for anyway? SpongeBob: Admit it, Sandy, you can't do anything us sea creatures can do. In fact, if it wasn't for that suit, you couldn't even live down here! [everyone but Sandy starts laughing] Sandy: Well, you don't... [all continue laughing] I don't need to... [all laughing harder] Grr... I'll show y’all! I don't need this suit! [rips off her suit, and all gasp] And I don't need this helmet neither! [throws her helmet to the ground, releasing an air bubble] Mr. Krabs: Neptune preserve her! Squidward: How long can she stay like that? SpongeBob: I don't know! Patrick: Sandy's a girl? SpongeBob: Wow, Sandy. You sure proved us wrong. I guess land creatures are better. [bubbles rise from Sandy's lips] At least until they need to breathe... [he, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs chuckle while Sandy angrily squints one eye at them] Yep, won't be long now. Sandy: [starts struggling to hold her breath] Mm? SpongeBob: Feelin' light-headed yet? Sandy: [shakes her head] Mm-mm. SpongeBob: Remember this? [takes a deep breath in and out] Mr. Krabs: It's free! [also takes a deep breath in and out] Sandy: [her face turns red as she starts to stifle. An x-ray of her torso shows her insides, where her lungs shrivel up; her left lung breaks from her windpipe and falls to the bottom. She gasps, inhaling a large amount of water, looks around in a panic, runs to the counter, where she quickly digs through multiple objects, eventually puts her head into a pickle jar, and breathes heavily. All the others start laughing] Stop laughin’ at me! Mr. Krabs: I knew it! There was no way some \"airhead\" was gonna win anything against a water breather! Patrick: Airhead... [laughs. The top of his head deflates like a balloon] Huh? [puts his thumb in his mouth and blows. His head becomes round at the top] SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs: Sea creatures rule! Water! Water! Water! Sandy: All right, all right! You had your little laugh. But now it's my turn! Y'all think you're such hot stuff, don't ya?! Swimmin’ around with your fancy gills and such. But none of you wetheads could last a minute on my turf. Dry land! Squidward: Do we have to wear pickle jars? [all, except Sandy, laugh] Sandy: Nope, nothin’ but the clothes on your backs. SpongeBob: One minute? No problem, Landy ! [all but Sandy begin to laugh] Sandy: [all but her are still laughing, as she leads them all to an island rising out of the water from the seafloor, as they see the island, they stop laughing] Well? So are you goin’ or not? SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs: [stammering] Uh, well, uh, uh, um... SpongeBob: Actually, you know, but... Squidward: We can't, uh...because... Mr. Krabs: We're late for, um... Patrick: Our fitting! Sandy: Oh, you mean for your chicken costumes? Patrick: [holding and eating popcorn] Hey! We are not chicken! [drops his popcorn] Huh! My popcorn! [begins pecking at it like a chicken] SpongeBob: Yeah, we're not chicken, we'll do it. [looks at the water's surface and pokes his finger above the water] There. Mission accomplished. Sandy: Look. Unless you can stay above water for one measly minute, you forfeit the contest and prove that land creatures are better than sea creatures! SpongeBob: No way, San-day. We can take on your challenge! Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs: Yeah! SpongeBob: We're not afraid of your dumb old land! Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs: Yeah! SpongeBob: We're sea creatures! SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs: Yeah! SpongeBob: Okay... Well, this is it. Mr. Krabs: Wait, boy! [gives him a glass of water] Make it last. SpongeBob: [drinks from it] Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Okay, here I go! [scene changes to live action as he gasps out of the water. He is now a real yellow kitchen sponge on a stick] Hey, this isn't so bad! We can do this! Hey, Patrick, come on up! The air is fine! Patrick: I'm gonna do it quick and get it over with. Cannonball! [jumps up out of the water. He is now a real pink starfish, missing his trunks, on a stick] Hey, I lost my trunks! Hi, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: All right, Pat, you made it! Come on, Mr. Krabs! Up here! Mr. Krabs: All ashore that's goin’ ashore, Mr. Squidward! Land ho! [runs up. He is a red rubber toy crab on a stick] SpongeBob: Looking good, Mr. Krabs! Patrick: Yeah! Yeah! Woo-hoo! SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward, you're missin’ all the dry. Come on, Squidward! SpongeBob, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs: [chanting] Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward: Well, I'll do it, but I won't like it. [walks up. He is a puppet octopus with his eyes and big nose. All stop chanting] What? SpongeBob: Well, here we are! [all four are walking on the island] Squidward: This is pretty easy. Patrick: I may keep a second rock up here! Mr. Krabs: Once you get your land legs, it's not so bad! SpongeBob: We're the masters of land and sea! [a string puppet seagull lands in front of them] Hey, it’s a local! Hi, we're from underwater! Do you know Sandy Cheeks? [the seagull looks at screen] Sandy: 3, 2, 1. Well, tan my fur. They made it! Better go congratulate 'em. [walks onto the island. She is now a real plush squirrel toy with a small, round plastic helmet on her head] SpongeBob! Patrick? Hmm, where'd those critters get to? [sees the seagull (and another) attacking all four of them; one of them is trying to eat Patrick, while the other is chasing SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward] [gasps] Holy guacamole! You can't eat my friends, you rats with wings! Hiyah! [attacks the birds offscreen and feathers start flying. All five sink back down to the seabed, with Squidward upside-down] SpongeBob: Uh, thanks for saving us, Sandy. Sandy: You know, everyone's best at somethin’. SpongeBob: But no one's best at everything. Sorry I made you take off your helmet, Sandy. Sandy: Sorry I made you go up on dry land, SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for feelin’ sorry for ourselves! Hip hip! All: Hooray! Mr. Krabs: Hip hip! All: Hooray! Mr. Krabs: Hip hip! Seagulls: [lying injured on the island with their feathers missing] Hooray.",

        "synopsis": "One day, Squidward was playing his clarinet but was disturbed by a doorbell which is a doctor who arrived at his house after mistaking his clarinet playing for a \"dying animal.\" He then receives a call from his former high school classmate and rival Squilliam Fancyson, who informs Squidward that he is the leader of a band that is supposed to play the prestigious Bubble Bowl the following week, but is unable to attend. He gives Squidward a backhanded offer to replace him, correctly suspecting that Squidward does not have his own band. However, Squidward defiantly insists that he does have a band and accepts the offer, before posting flyers around Bikini Bottom looking for people to join his band.On the first night of rehearsals, Squidward brings his rented instruments to a practice hall filled with townspeople. Upon discovering that none of his prospective bandmates have any previous musical experience, Squidward teaches them the basics. Unfortunately, the night doesn't end well as Squidward gets pinned to the wall by drumsticks the players mistook as mouth instruments while Sandy beats up Patrick and shoves his body through the bore of a trombone after he kicks her leg.Things do not get any better during the second day of training; while practicing a march through the street, two flag twirlers are killed when they spin their flags too fast, causing them to fly into the air and crash into a passing blimp. On the third day, Squidward checks on Plankton's harmonica solo, though he becomes exhausted and collapses from running back and forth between the holes since the harmonica is much bigger than him.On the fourth and final day of practice, Squidward says that while none of them have made any improvement since the beginning, he suggests that everyone play loud so they will be good. Unfortunately, they take this theory a bit too literally as they play so loud and badly that the windows of the practice hall break and Squidward's face is deformed beyond recognition, prompting him to change the plan to playing extremely quietly so nobody will hear them. The band members then begin to insult each other, and despite Squidward attempting to quell the rising tensions, a mass brawl breaks out that damages most of the instruments. When the clock hits 10:00 PM, the fighting ends and everyone starts to head home.Squidward stops them at the entrance and expresses his disappointment at their lack of progress and for not taking his dream seriously. After Squidward leaves in distress at his failure, a remorseful SpongeBob asks the townspeople to think about all of the times Squidward came through for them. Despite drawing a blank, they are convinced enough to give practice one more try for Squidward's sake, with SpongeBob as the conductor.At the day of the performance, Squidward prepares to finalize his band's cancellation, only to find Squilliam waiting for him at the entrance of the Bubble Bowl. Squidward tries to explain that his band can no longer play as they all died in a marching accident, but they suddenly appear behind him in full uniform with their instruments ready, forcing Squidward to go through with the performance.As everyone enters a huge glass dome, Squidward bemoans the humiliation that he is certain is awaiting him. The dome rises into a football stadium filled with human fans. Squidward, still fearing that the performance will be a disaster, nervously begins conducting. But to his and Squilliam's astonishment, the band performs \"Sweet Victory\" and it turns out to be a tremendous success. As the crowd sways in awe, Squilliam faints in shock while going to the hospital. Squidward throws away his baton and leaps into the air in triumph.",

        "transcript": "[The episode begins at Squidward's house. A sound is heard, which turns out to be Squidward playing his clarinet until the doorbell rings. Dr. Gilliam is at the door with Incidental 26.] Gilliam: Yeah, uhh, we're with the pet hospital down the street and I understand you have a dying animal on the premises. [Squidward slams the door shut. The phone starts to ring.] Squidward: Hello. You've reached the house of unrecognized talent. Please start after the... [plays a clarinet note] Squilliam Fancyson: Sounds like you've got a dying animal to attend to, eh, old chum? Squidward: [gasps] Squilliam Fancyson from band class?! Squilliam: I hear you're playing the cash register now. Squidward: Sometimes. Uh, how's the unibrow? Squilliam: [waves his unibrow] It's big and valuable. I'm the leader of a big fancy band now, and we're supposed to play the Bubble Bowl next week. Squidward: The buh-buh-buh... The buh-buh-buh... The buh-buh-buh…?! Squilliam: That's right. I'm living your dreams, Squidward. The problem is, I'm busy next week and can't make it. So, I was hoping you and your band could cover for us. Squidward: Ohh, uhh, I, I, I, I uhh... Squilliam: I knew it! You don't even have a band! Well, I'll just let you get back to the service industry now. Squidward: Hold it! It just so happens that I don't sell fast food, I do have a band, and we're gonna play that Bubble Bowl! How do you like that, Fancy Boy?! Squilliam: Good luck next Tuesday. I hope the audience brings lots of... ibuprofen! [Squilliam and Squidward hang up the phones.] Squidward: I've got to drum up a marching band fast! Drum... haha... band humor. [Bubble transition to Sandy. In the following lines, Sandy, Plankton, Mrs. Puff, Mr. Krabs, and Larry are reading from a poster. Each are in different locations.] Sandy: Looking to add fulfillment to your dull, dull life? Plankton: Then become part of the greatest musical sensation ever to hit Bikini Bottom... Mrs. Puff: ...and be forever adored by thousands of people you don't know. Mr. Krabs: Not to mention… free refreshments! Larry: Practice begins tonight, 8:30 sharp. [Squidward looks at his watch, which reads 8:35, while driving a shell cart. There are boxes of musical instruments, sheet music, and marching uniforms crammed in the back seat.] Squidward: Stupid music rental clerk made me late. That trilobite didn't know an oboe from an elbow. Heh, elbow, heh, more band humor. [The scene cuts to inside the room, where everyone is there holding instruments and talking amongst themselves as Squidward enters. He walks in front of the seats.] All: Blah, blah, blah, blah... Squidward: People, people, settle down! Okay, now. How many of you have played musical instruments before? Plankton: [holds a triangle instrument, raises hand] Do instruments of torture count? Squidward: No. Patrick: [holds a trumpet, raises hand] Is mayonnaise an instrument? Squidward: No, Patrick, mayonnaise is not an instrument. [Patrick raises his hand again] Horseradish is not an instrument, either. [Patrick lowers his hand] That's fine. No one has any experience. Fortunately, I have enough talent for all of you. [Squidward slaps his tentacle leg and laughs. Everyone stays silent.] Mr. Krabs: When do we get the free food? Squidward: Okay, try to repeat after me. [plays six notes on his clarinet] Brass section, go. [brass section repeats badly] Good. Now the wind. [wind section repeats badly] And the drums. [drummers misunderstand what Squidward means, so they blow on their sticks which shoot out of their mouths and stick him to the wall] Too bad that didn't kill me. [Bubble transition to later.] Squidward: Let's just try stepping in rhythm. Now I want everyone to stand in straight rows of five. SpongeBob: [raises hand] Is this the part where we start kicking? Squidward: No, SpongeBob, that's a chorus line. Patrick: Kicking? I wanna do some kicking! [kicks Sandy in the leg] Sandy: Ow! Why, you...! Why I oughta...! [jumps on Patrick and starts beating him up until they roll outside and the doors slam shut] Patrick: [screams and sobs in pain] Aaaaaah-ho-ho-ho-ho-aaah! [everyone pauses and stares at the door, then Patrick sticks his head back in] Whoever is the owner of the white sedan, you left your lights on. [Patrick walks in and it is revealed that Sandy has stuck his body in a trombone. Trombone notes are heard as he walks towards his seat. As he sits down, he makes a sound on his trombone. Makes a loud trombone noise as he opens his mouth. Stares at himself.] French Narrator: Day two. [The scene shows the band walking down a street playing Semper Fidelis, badly.] Squidward: Okay, that's perfect, everybody. Bubble Bowl, here we come. Flag twirlers, really spin those things. Okay, turn. Flag twirlers, let's go. I wanna see some spinning. Flag twirlers, let's move! C'mon, move! [The flag twirlers spin so hard that they take off into the sky and crash into a blimp, which causes an explosion, killing all three. Incidental 41 plays Taps while everyone mourns, except Squidward, who just lies down on the ground and curls into a fetal position.] French Narrator: Day three. Squidward: How's that harmonica solo coming, Plankton? Plankton: It's tremendous! You wanna see? [Plankton plays the harmonica by running to and from the holes quickly, but soon runs out of breath; on his way to the last hole, he pants as he walks towards it, and he blows an unsuccessful last raspberry into the harmonica and faints.] French Narrator: Day four. Squidward: Well, this is our last night together before the show. And I know that you haven't improved since we began... [Patrick chews on a trumpet] ...but I have a theory. People talk loud when they wanna act smart, right? Plankton: [loudly] Correct! Squidward: So, if we play loud, people might think we're good. Everybody ready? And a-one, and a-two, and-a one, two, three, four! [The screen cuts to the outside of the music school and a blast of noise ensues, breaking the windows. Cuts back inside the music school, where Squidward's face is deformed beyond recognition, his shirt's been ripped, and his baton breaks.] Squidward: Okay, new theory. Maybe we should play so quietly, no one can hear us. Harold: Well, maybe we wouldn't sound so bad if some people didn't try to play with big, meaty claws! Mr. Krabs: What did you say, punk?! Harold: [shouts loudly] Big... meaty... claws ! Mr. Krabs: Well, these claws ain't for just attractin' mates! Harold: Bring it on, old man! Bring it on! SpongeBob: [tries intervening] No, people. Let's be smart and bring it off . Incidental 7: Oh, so now the talking cheese is gonna preach to us. Squidward: Wait, wait! I know tensions are high... [Every band member gets into a fight. Incidental 106 and Larry are yelling at each other. Incidental 13 slams a drum on Incidental 106. Squidward tries to settle the fight in a semi-worried tone.] Squidward: There's a deposit on that equipment, people! [Every band member uses their instruments as weapons. Mr. Krabs and Incidental 40 charge at each other with large woodwinds, but try to screech to a halt, and Mrs. Puff slams them both with her cymbals.] Squidward: Settle down, please! [Sandy and Incidental 42 are fighting. Sandy breaks the xylophone keys from Incidental 42 and Incidental 42 runs away. Patrick kicks Sandy, who growls at him before producing a trumpet with an evil grin. Patrick realizes what's coming and runs away screaming as Sandy chases him with the trumpet. The scene cuts to the clock which shows it being 10 o'clock and everyone stops fighting.] Fred: Hey, class is over! Within the crowd: Okay, yeah, see ya tomorrow. That was good. Say, what are you doing after...? [The band members walk to the door, where Squidward slams it open.] Squidward: Well, you did it. You took my one chance in happiness... and crushed it. Crushed it into little, tiny, bite-size pieces. I really had expected better of you people. I guess I'm a loser for that, too. Don't bother showing up tomorrow. I'll just tell them you all died in a marching accident. So thanks. [sobs] Thanks for nothing! [leaves] Patrick: You're welcome. SpongeBob: What kind of monsters are we? That poor creature came to us in his hour of need, and we failed him. Squidward's always been there for us when it was convenient for him. Evelyn, when your little Jimmy was trapped in a fire, who rescued him? Evelyn: A fireman. SpongeBob: And Larry, when your heart gave out from all those tanning pills, who revived you? Larry: Some guy in an ambulance. SpongeBob: Right. So, if we can all just pretend that Squidward was a fireman, or some guy in an ambulance, then I'm sure that we can all pull together and discover what it truly means to be in a marching band. Harold: Yeah, for the fireman! All: Hooray! SpongeBob: Now let's make Squidward proud. A-one, a-two, a skiddly diddly doo. [Bubble transition to the Bubble Bowl.] Squidward: I knew this was gonna happen. They're just gonna have to find another band to play. I just hope that... [zooms out to reveal Squilliam is there] ...Squilliam doesn't find out! Squilliam! [screams] What are you doing here?! Squilliam: [laughs] I just wanna watch you blow it. So, where's your band? Squidward: Uh... they couldn't come. They... died. Squilliam: Then who's that? [points to SpongeBob and the rest of the band] Squidward: [screams and his eyes pop out] That would be my band! SpongeBob: We're ready to perform, Squidward. Squilliam: Well, Squiddy, this is exactly how I pictured your band would look. [SpongeBob dances eagerly.] Squidward: That's his eager face. Squilliam: [laughs] [Squidward and his band all go into the Bubble Bowl.] Squidward: [everybody marches to the Bubble Bowl and starts performing.] I guess this will be the last time I can show my face in this town. SpongeBob: [as Squilliam follows the band] That's the spirit, Squidward! [The bowl raises above a football field.] Football Announcer: Okay, football fans. Put your hands together for the Bikini Bottom Super Band! [A crowd of live-action people waving towels and cheering is shown.] Patrick: These are some ugly looking fish. SpongeBob: Maybe we're in one of those toxic waste dumps. Mr. Krabs: I think I'm gonna be sick. Squidward: [nervously] Okay, everybody. [glances at Squilliam, who grins, chuckles and bounces his unibrow] Let's get this over with. 1, 2, 3, 4... [The band's horn players play an intro fanfare. Squidward opens his eyes, shocked.

        "synopsis": "The episode starts at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, where SpongeBob's class receives an assignment for an 800-word essay on what not to do at a stoplight, due the following morning. SpongeBob cannot wait to get started and, upon arriving home, prepares his materials and workspace. However, he has trouble thinking of what to write, and gets distracted by seeing his friends playing outside.Time passes as SpongeBob tries to create the right mood for writing. He does some calisthenics, feeds Gary, cleans his kitchen, and takes copious breaks in between. It eventually becomes clear that SpongeBob is only looking for excuses to avoid the essay. Even Patrick points it out when SpongeBob calls to chat with him in the middle of the night.While wasting more time deciding on the proper bread to use for making himself a sandwich, SpongeBob hears a knock at the door and rushes to greet the mailman delivering a package. When SpongeBob attempts to engage in small talk, the mailman cuts him off and suggests that SpongeBob has an essay to write. Suspicious, SpongeBob slowly heads back inside to find a newscaster on TV reporting on SpongeBob's unfinished essay. He soon discovers that many of his possessions, now suddenly alive, are conspiring against him to prevent the completion of his work. Their interference results in SpongeBob getting locked outside without his pants. At that moment, the flame from a candle comes alive and burns his paper and sets fire to his house which, also suddenly alive, begs SpongeBob as it burns to \"Stop wasting time.\"Finally waking up and realizing much of his procrastination was part of a nightmare, SpongeBob looks first at his woefully incomplete essay, then at the clock, marking five minutes before class time. In desperation, he suddenly realizes that everything he did (or imagined doing) up to that point was something that should not be done at a stoplight, and so he quickly writes it all down to fulfill the 800-word requirement.Excitedly bringing the finished essay to school, SpongeBob finds the classroom empty. Mrs. Puff arrives and explains that she tried to call SpongeBob to give him an update. Due to a teachers' convention she must attend, Mrs. Puff has canceled the assignment and will instead take the class on a field trip the following week to see a stoplight. Left behind with his big smile frozen in place (when he realized that he crammed in vain for no reason to complete his assignment), SpongeBob then rips his essay in half before he splits himself in half, ending the episode.",

        "transcript": "Mrs. Puff: Okay, class, quiet, quiet! Now get out your pencil and paper and write down the assignment. [class groans] SpongeBob: [leans towards Nat] Did you hear that? We get an assignment! Mrs. Puff: Everyone must write an essay on what not to do at a stoplight. [class groans again] SpongeBob: [Again leaning towards Nat] Did you hear that?! What not to do at a stoplight! Mrs. Puff: In no less than 800 words. [squeals and class groans again] Nat: [acting like SpongeBob] Did you hear that?! 800 words! SpongeBob: Yeah, I know! [Nat frowns] Mrs. Puff: Due tomorrow. And remember class: work hard and no goofing off. [Bubble transition to back at SpongeBob's house] SpongeBob: Okay, Gary, no goofin’ off! I am about to write the greatest essay of all time. Like most great essays, it will be written on paper. Even more important than the paper is [holds up a pencil] the pencil. A pencil as sharp or as dull as I like. Hmm... funny... as my ideas grow, you shrink. [kisses the pencil as little hearts fly out of it] Well, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to write an essay. [looks at window, it's colorful outside] Okay, here we go. What. Not. To do. At. A. Stoplight. Hey this is easy! By SpongeBob SquarePants. Hah! This essay is pure gold! And now pencil, get ready to do your stuff because here we go! [SpongeBob's clock is shown. Several hours pass and he has still only written ten words] Gee, this is harder than I thought... [SpongeBob looks outside where everyone is having fun] Patrick: [applies lotion on Sandy] Come on, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob goes back to his desk] SpongeBob: It should be against the law to have to write an essay on such a super sailorific, sunshiny day! Oh! But I must press onward, because with this pencil, and the completion of this essay, I'll be one step closer to my driver's license! [a live-action drag race is shown. a car hits a wall, tumbles and gets back up] Oh, yeah. This'll be no problemo. Why, I've got plenty of time. It's only six o'clock. Okay, okay here we go, here we go. [struggles to write] I know, I just need to get blood pumpin' in the old noodle. How about some calisthenics? [SpongeBob does calisthenics. While doing it, he recites \"Hup Hoo\" several times, with his nose and eyelashes doing it too.] SpongeBob: I can feel those juices pumpin' now! [moves his chair closer to the table. he does it a lot because of the fun noise it makes. He then laughs] Huh? What am I doing?! I've gotta write that paper! [pushes his chair in] Come on, pencil, make words. Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Gary! Hey, hey, hey, Gary! How's my favorite mollusk? How about you let ol' SpongeBob fix you up somethin’ to eat? Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: What do you mean you're not hungry? Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: I know I have an essay to write! Now come on, Gary. [Grabs Gary by his shell and pours some food he takes up a ladder and fills it to ceiling-level] I've gotta make sure you have your nutrition, Gary, so I'm not leaving until you eat every single bite. [Gary quickly eats it] Gary, are-are you sure you don't want some crème brulée? Or, or some chocolate-flavored algae bits? [steps on Gary's food] Gee, Gary sure made a mess. I can't work on my essay knowing there's a mess in the kitchen. [cleans it up using himself as a mop] Hmm... I might as well clean the rest of the floor while I'm at it. I should get these hard-to-reach places too! And these dishes need to be cleaned! Can't have dirty garbage. [sprays the garbage can] Well, I think it's clean enough now! Why that didn't take too long... and it's only... Ten o'clock?! [horrific sting plays] Ooh... No more foolin’ around! I've gotta get back to work! Okay, Mr. Es-say, I say... prepare to be written! [the graphite tip of his pencil approaches the paper like a diving fighter plane, and finally makes contact with it] I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Yeah... yeah... yeah! And some of these, and some of these... Almost there and... [finishes writing. The pencil is steaming due to the excess force] done. Now lets see how it looks so far. \"The-\" [shows he has only written \"the\" in fancy lettering] Break time! Pacing always helps me think. Let's see, only seven hundred ninety-nine words to go... Think, SpongeBob, think! [looks at the telephone. Cut to Patrick in bed, snoring. The phone rings and he wakes up] Patrick: Who is that? [picks up phone] Hello? SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, whatcha up to? Patrick: Sleeping. SpongeBob: That's really fascinating, are you havin’ a good sleep? Any dreams you'd like to discuss? I remember on the... Patrick: SpongeBob, you and I both know that you're just choosing me as a distraction so you don't have to write your essay. SpongeBob: [gasps] That is-that is not true! I called to have an engaging conversation with you! Patrick: Well, I'm listening. SpongeBob: Uh... Marco! Patrick: Polo! [hangs up] SpongeBob: Yeah, well I gotta get going Patrick, got an important essay to write? [hangs up phone] Sheesh, what a chatterbox. Can't he see that I'm busy? [back to his desk with eraser shavings on his paper] I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper! [swats the shavings away but they float above the paper] Now they're floating around my thinking space. [blows them away] So long, pesky particles! [the shavings float back to SpongeBob. As he struggles to remove the shavings, he swallows one in the process] I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water! [goes to the kitchen and drinks water] That was a close one. Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: What do you mean \"overly dramatic,\" Gary? [rubs his tummy] All that choking sure made me hungry. Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: I can't write on an empty stomach, Gary. I gotta have my brain food! [opens the refrigerator] Now let's see... White or rye bread... or pumpernickel. Gee, I guess it really depends on the meat inside... and the cheese. [doorbell rings] A visitor? For me!? [SpongeBob opens the door to meet Norton the Mailfish] Hello! Norton: Package for Mr. SquarePants. SpongeBob: Great, thanks! So, uh, do you like delivering mail? Norton: It puts bread on the table. SpongeBob: Rye or pumpernickel? [laughs] Norton: Oh, brother.. SpongeBob: So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain... Norton: Don't you have a paper to write? [He walks away] SpongeBob: [Gulps and zooms in on his face] How did he know I'm supposed to be writing an essay? [blipping his eyes and slides back into his house] Realistic Fish Head: In other news, local resident SpongeBob SquarePants only has a few hours left to complete his essay, and yet he continues to goof off. [head sticks out TV] When will he learn? SpongeBob: Hi-yah! [karate chops the TV causing a zap and glass breaking. lights a candle] Chair: Hey, SpongeBob? Over here! Come on, take a seat. Put your feet up and relax. SpongeBob: [gasps and a bell rings and drops the candle that went out and the clock lights up] Oh no! Midnight! [runs through the hallway of clocks and the alarms ring on the walls] Must... get... back to desk! [runs to the table, but it has enlarged. he jumps up on the chair] Whew, that was a close call. [his pants are missing] Ah! My pants! Pants: Yoo hoo! Down here! SpongeBob: You get up here! I've got to get back to work! Pants: [runs out of SpongeBob's Pineapple to the door] Freedom! SpongeBob: [runs out the door] Stop Pants, you get back here this instant! Paaants... [door closes, SpongeBob yelps, then tries to get back in, but it is locked. He looks in the window. The candle is still lighting. The clock spins, breaks, and comes to life] Snail Clock: [ghostly voice] Time's up, SpongeBob... SpongeBob: [gasps as the candle comes to life] Burning! Fire Wick: Only seven hundred ninety-nine words to go. [laughs sinisterly as he burns the essay] SpongeBob: No! [the fire wick burns his entire pineapple. He screams] What have I done?! [SpongeBob runs around his house, yelling] Help! Help! My house is on fire! [continues running around his burning house with black smoke until it comes to life] SpongeBob's House: SpongeBob, why? Why did you set me on fire, SpongeBob? Why didn't you just write your essay?! Stop wasting time! SpongeBob: [wakes up] Where's my essay? Oh, there you are! [laughs] I must have dozed off. [grabs his paper from his head] Lets see where are we? [holding his paper with a word \"The\" is still there, puts the paper down on the desk] Do I dare look at the clock... [slowly looks at the clock and gasps] It's almost nine o'clock! Class starts in five minutes. How am I gonna write this whole paper in five minutes? How am I supposed to know what not to do at a stoplight? Feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight! [Writing] And making a sandwich, and lighting candles, and drinking water, and calling your friends, and karate chopping the TV, and shootin' the breeze with the mailman, and fallin' asleep... [Bubble transition to SpongeBob running to the boating school] Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! I'm finished! All eight hundred words! I'm finished! Here it is! [goes inside, but nobody is there] Mrs. Puff? Where is everybody? Mrs. Puff: Oh, there you are, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Here you go, Mrs. Puff! Eight hundred words! All about stoplights and what not to do at 'em. Mrs. Puff: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I tried to call you... I have to go to a teacher's convention. SpongeBob: (shouts slightly) But what about my essay!? Mrs. Puff: I decided to cancel the assignment. We're just going to take a field trip to a stoplight instead. See you next week! [SpongeBob rips his essay, then he rips himself in half as the episode ends.]",

        "synopsis": "As the episode starts, SpongeBob is at boating school, and Mrs. Puff announces a new student will be joining the class. His name is Flats the Flounder, and he tells SpongeBob that he is going to \"kick his butt.\" SpongeBob at first assumes him to be joking, but Flats soon makes it clear that he really means to beat up SpongeBob. An extremely paranoid SpongeBob tries to seek help and to reason with Flats, but to no avail.SpongeBob asks Patrick for help, only to learn that he and Flats were buddies back in community college. He then tries to go to Mrs. Puff to help, who talks to Flats and explains to SpongeBob that \"kicking his butt\" means that Flats wants to become his friend, which is obviously not true. He then encounters Flats' dad in a boat and confronts him about his son's actions, only for the latter to go up to his father and threaten him as well, because he said \"Now he's gonna kick my butt!\". SpongeBob panics and sprints away.He eventually runs away into town, where Flats attempts to run him over with a garbage truck, but he eventually drives over a banana peel SpongeBob drops, causing it to flip over. Flats awakens in the hospital, where he learns that SpongeBob saved his life by performing CPR on him for five hours straight.Despite this, Flats continues to pursue SpongeBob; when SpongeBob runs through town and warn everyone about Flats, some people kick an old man's butt who they think is going to kick SpongeBob's butt. The old man was by a bus stop and Harold angrily asks how many times they have to teach him this lesson. Eventually, he corners SpongeBob in his own home, where he proceeds to beat him up.However, due to SpongeBob's spongy body, he absorbs the blows without harm. Flats continues to hit SpongeBob nonstop throughout all of next week, until he finally faints from exhaustion; his classmates cheer for SpongeBob. However, pitying Flats, SpongeBob starts a speech about how violence leads to nowhere, which ends with him making a fist. Just then, Mrs. Puff enters and sees Flats unconscious and SpongeBob making a fist, and believes the latter beat up Flats. Enraged by the disaster, Mrs. Puff shouts to a stunned SpongeBob that she is going to kick his butt before the screen fades to black, thus ending the episode.",

        "transcript": "[The episode begins at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, where SpongeBob is arranging his pencils on his desk.] SpongeBob: Excuse me, miss? Incidental 7: I don't want to have to report you again. SpongeBob: [laughs] I was just wondering... [points to the 'Homework' pencil while the other two pencils say 'Quiz' and 'Essay'] ...is it the homework pencil on the left side of the paper next to the quiz pencil, or over on the right side all by itself? Or... Incidental 7: I think it goes stuck inside your... SpongeBob: Wait, I got it! The quiz pencil goes right over here next to the essay pencil [moves the pencil] and the essay pencil gets turned sideways toward the notepad, [turns it sideways] just in case I have to write an essay. Mrs. Puff: [walks in] Good morning, class. Sorry, I'm late. I got caught in traffic on the way in here when that whole 'I'm-going-to-be-doing-this-for-the-rest-of-my-life' thing reared its ugly head and I... [everyone stares at her blankly] Anyway, we have a new student starting today, so let's all put on a happy face for Flats the flounder. [opens the door to show a skinny flounder from the front but when he turns sideways, he's large. The entire class, except SpongeBob, are all wearing colorful smiling masks] Tell the class something about yourself, Flats. Flats The Flounder: Well, I like to kick people's butts. Mrs. Puff: [laughs] What a card! Now Flats, it's time to pick your seat. Just go ahead and sit anywhere you'd like. [the class move their desks away from the middle of the room, except SpongeBob. Flats sits in the empty seat next to him] Okay class, as you remember last week... SpongeBob: [to Flats] Hi, I'm SpongeBob! Flats: Hi, SpongeBob. I'm gonna kick your butt. SpongeBob: [gasps, then laughs] That joke was almost funnier the second time. Flats: [leans over SpongeBob menacingly] No. I mean it. SpongeBob: [giggles] That time it almost seemed like... [Flats rips off his chest hair to show a tattoo that says 'I mean it'. Horror-struck] ...you did mean it. [raises his hand] Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: Yes, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Can I be excused for the rest of my life? [Mrs. Puff chuckles] Mrs. Puff: Why no, SpongeBob. I'm in the middle of a coffee-fueled sermon right now. You can't afford to miss this information. SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff. [puts his hand down] Sorry, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: Now, can I please have a volunteer to come up to the board? How about you, Flats? [Flats approaches the board] Please draw for us a diagram of a basic four-way intersection, Flats. [draws an image on the board] Please turn and show the class what you drew, honey. [Flats has drawn pictures of SpongeBob being beat up; SpongeBob yelps in horror] My! How very creative! We have an artist in the class! [everyone applauds, except SpongeBob. Bubble transition to SpongeBob running in the halls and into the bathroom and hides in one of the toilets] SpongeBob: I just don't understand. Why would Flats want to kick my butt? I haven't said two words to the guy! [cut back to SpongeBob saying \"Hi, I'm SpongeBob!\" SpongeBob counts on his fingers] One, two, [gasps] oh no, that's three! What am I going to do? [hears the door open] What was that? Someone's coming. They're getting closer. I've just got to act natural. [Incidental 37B opens the lid and sees a real sponge] Incidental 37B: Oh that's real nice. [walks out] SpongeBob: Phew, I thought for sure that was gonna be... [Flats opens the stall] Flats! Uh, hello, sir. Kick any good butts lately? Yeah, I remember last week, I was kicking this guy's butt real good. And he leans over and says, 'Hey, you know, life's like a bucket of wood shavings. [Flats looks dumbfounded] Except for when the shavings are in a pail, then it's like a pail of wood shavings! [giggles] Flats: Hey, that story really speaks to me. SpongeBob: Really? What's it say? Flats: It says now, I'm gonna kick your butt twice as hard. [leaves SpongeBob who flushes the toilet, making water spray out of his holes. Bubble transition to SpongeBob walking down the hall while writing on a clipboard] SpongeBob: ...and I leave Gary's water bowl to Gary, and my curtains to... oh Neptune, I just can't do this. [the school phone rings and SpongeBob picks it up] Death row, next in line speaking. Patrick: [over phone] Hi, I'd like to place an order for delivery. SpongeBob: Patrick? Is that you? [cut back to Patrick's rock] Patrick: Yeah, hey, Mario. Let me get a large double olive, double- [cut back to SpongeBob] SpongeBob: Patrick, listen! It's me, SpongeBob! I need your help! Patrick: [over phone] You're working at Pizza Castle now? SpongeBob: What? No, listen! I'm in big trouble. There's a new guy at school here and he wants to kick my butt! Listen, you're big and strong, do you think you could come down here and maybe rough him a bit? Just to get him off my back? Please, Patrick, I'm so scared, it feels like I'm gonna throw up. Patrick: [over phone] No, they're not closed. I know, you want olives. SpongeBob: Patrick, are you there? Patrick: [over phone] Oh, sorry, SpongeBob. I was just talking to my old community college buddy, Flats. [SpongeBob is horror-struck. Cut to Patrick's rock where Flats is sitting on the couch enjoying a beverage] I bumped into him at the soda store, isn't that funny? [cut back to SpongeBob. The background becomes black except for a white color surrounding SpongeBob; SpongeBob goes to the right of the screen and to the background three times] Well it must have been years since we've seen each other. Well, let me get going. He's got to go back to school soon. He says he's got to kick somebody's butt. [SpongeBob drops the phone and runs away screaming] Hello? Is this Pizza Castle? [cut to Mrs. Puff's room where SpongeBob is still heard screaming then smashes into the door] Mrs. Puff: Come in, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, can I be in a different class? Mrs. Puff: But why? SpongeBob: I can't tell you. Mrs. Puff: Why ever not? SpongeBob: I just can't, Mrs. Puff. My physical being is at stake, let's just leave it at that. Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, you can tell me anything. You've got to believe that. SpongeBob: Well, okay. But only if you promise to keep it between us. Mrs. Puff: Of course. SpongeBob: Flats says he's going to kick my butt! Mrs. Puff: What?! There shall be no butt-kicking in any class of mine! This is an adult program, SpongeBob. Just leave it to me. SpongeBob: Aw, thanks, Mrs. Puff. I knew I could count on you. [Bubble transition to SpongeBob eating a sandwich outside for lunch. The bell rings and everyone goes back in the classroom] Mrs. Puff: Have a nice lunch, SpongeBob? [walks in the classroom] SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: [whispers] SpongeBob, I talked to Flats for you. I used your name. It was all a misunderstanding. SpongeBob: You what?!?! Mrs. Puff: He was never going to kick your butt at all! You see SpongeBob, Flats is from a town where kicking someone's butt means that he wants to be your friend. [Flats makes a SpongeBob out of sand and kicks it] And maybe play some sports with you on weekends. SpongeBob: [nervously] I've got diarrhea! [runs off and sees an older flounder in a boat] Huh? Are you Flats' dad? Mr. Flounder: Why, yes I am. SpongeBob: Okay, see, I didn't know where else to turn! Patrick couldn't help me, and Mrs. Puff only made it worse. I sit next to your son Flats in school, and he is a fine boy and all, and I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but he wants to kick my butt. [Flats is by the boat to confront his father] Flats: Dad, what are you doing? Mr. Flounder: [nervously] Uh, nothing son. Flats: What did I tell you about talking to strangers? Mr. Flounder: [to SpongeBob, frightened] Now he's gonna kick my butt! SpongeBob: [screams in horror and runs away through the whole town] Out of my way! Out of my way! [points] Can't you see he's gonna kick my butt?! [a bunch of fish look over to Incidental 85 the older fish at a bus stop; thinking he was Flats] Incidental 85: Hi there, young people. Nice day today. Harold: So, you like kicking butts, do ya?! Well, we'll show you, old man! [the fish start beating up on Lonnie while SpongeBob is hiding in a garbage can] SpongeBob: Okay, okay, I got to skip town, start a new life, live under an assumed name! \"BobPants SpongeSquare.\" Yeah, that's good. Grow a beard, and then shave it off, and live happily ever after. [Flats is behind him driving a dump truck] Flats: Yeah, except you forgot the part where I kick your butt! [SpongeBob gasps three times and runs off while still in the garbage can, with Flats chasing him. As he is running down the road, trash falls out of the garbage can. Flats chuckles. A banana peel falls out of the garbage can. Flats sees the banana peel on the ground and screams while attempting to slow down, but the dump truck runs over the peel, flipping upside down and crushing him.] Oof! [ Cut to later where Flats is covered with cast in his entire body while lying in a bed in the hospital] SpongeBob: Hey, Flats, you feeling better? Flats: What? Where am I? The Doctor: [walks in] Why, you're in the hospital. This young boy saved your life. He performed CPR for five hours straight. SpongeBob: Yeah. They said you'd be okay after the first few minutes, but I just wanted to be sure. Flats: Wow, I'm touched. I'll have to remember that when I'm kicking your butt. [SpongeBob is thunderstruck, accompanied with glass shattering] Those flowers for me? SpongeBob: [screaming as he runs out of the hospital after bringing flowers to Flats] He's still gonna kick my butt! [the fish look at Lonnie at a bus stop again] Harold: How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man!? Incidental 85: I love the young people! [the angry fish walk up to Incidental 85. Cut to SpongeBob running back to his house] SpongeBob: Oh, Gary! I'm too young to have my butt kicked! There are so many things in life I haven't gotten to do! [cut to SpongeBob in an office building at a desk, on the phone] Hang on, I'll transfer your call. [cut back to a knock on the door] Who is it? [door falls down. SpongeBob sees Flats and screams] Flats! Flats: It's butt-kicking time! SpongeBob: Gary, there's something I want you to know, but I'm too scared to remember what it is. [Flats cracks his knuckles more and more. SpongeBob breathes harder and harder. Flats brushes his teeth and gargles. SpongeBob breathes harder] Flats: Let's do it! SpongeBob: Go away, Gary. I don't want you to see this. It'll be ugly. [Gary gets out a camera from his shell] Flats: Are you ready? SpongeBob: Hold on. [puts a blindfold over his eyes] Okay, I'm ready. [Flats punches SpongeBob, but it doesn't hurt him] I said I'm ready. [Flats tries again but same result happens] Didn't you hear me? I said I'm ready. [Flats punches him again and this time SpongeBob giggles] That tickles. [Flats keeps punching him but nothing seems to hurt SpongeBob] Gary, I'm absorbing his blows like I was made of some kind of spongy material! Do you know what that means? I get to go to work tomorrow! [cut to next day where SpongeBob is in the Krusty Krab kitchen, grilling, and Flats is still punching SpongeBob, then scene cuts to him playing cards with Gary] You have any sevens? Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: [chasing jellyfish, walking out of the bathroom, sleeping, and eating breakfast, while Flats is still punching him. Cut to boating school as SpongeBob is sitting at his desk and Flats is punching, but is now exhausted. He passes out due to exhaustion] Flats, are you okay? [everyone cheers] Do not cheer me, my fellow adult classmates. Flats was the real victim here. A victim of a society that's riding down a violent road to nowhere; a road I call... [clenches fist] ...'violence road'. [Mrs. Puff walks in] Mrs. Puff: Sorry I'm late, class, I... [gasps as she sees SpongeBob's fist and Flats on the ground] SpongeBob! I can't believe you beat up a new student! [zoom out of school] I'm going to kick your butt!",

        "synopsis": "The episode opens as SpongeBob is taking his driving test yet again. He ends up leaving the driving course and wrecking the boating school and the city, before driving off an unfinished bridge and falling into an abyss. The police follow the boat and end up driving off the bridge and into the abyss themselves. SpongeBob, Mrs. Puff, and the police all land on top of a truck full of fruit punch being delivered to Shady Shoals Rest Home, causing it to fall over and spill, flooding the rest home. Although SpongeBob is responsible, the incident occurred under Mrs. Puff's supervision, and she is sent to prison for gross negligence. In prison, she realizes that she will not see SpongeBob again for a very long time, and starts to enjoy it.Meanwhile, SpongeBob is depressed that Mrs. Puff is in jail, and Patrick tells him that it is SpongeBob's fault. The duo sets out to free her from jail. First, they try to rob the bank in order to get arrested themselves, but SpongeBob gets wrapped up in the bureaucratic niceties of banking and forgets they are trying to commit a crime. Next, they disguise themselves as rocks that the prisoners smash as labor. They try to communicate with Mrs. Puff, who calls the guards, but they dismiss her conversation with two rocks as a hallucination and move her to kitchen duty. SpongeBob and Patrick are then smashed by another inmate, costing them their deposit on the costumes. Then they hide in a vat of chili in the cafeteria and offer to help Mrs. Puff escape through it, but she explains to them that she likes it in prison, which SpongeBob refuses to believe. He worries that Mrs. Puff is completely institutionalized in prison and he needs to get her out. In an attempt to coax her, SpongeBob tells Mrs. Puff if she can escape, he will stay after school and decorate the entire classroom, but Mrs. Puff refuses. She calls for the prison guards again and is reassigned again after the prison guards believe that Mrs. Puff is going crazy.SpongeBob and Patrick appear to her yet again on a coat hanger assembly line, and when she calls for a guard, he somehow perceives SpongeBob and Patrick as raw materials used to make the coat hangers and dismisses her to her cell once again. SpongeBob and Patrick then appear in Mrs. Puff's cell toilet, asking her to hop in, and when Mrs. Puff calls for a guard again, he simply flushes them down the toilet and leaves. They then appear in her bed, and Mrs. Puff calls for the guards yet again, but this time the two guards that appear are SpongeBob and Patrick in disguise. After they leave, the real guards show up after hearing her screaming and crying, but Mrs. Puff thinks its still SpongeBob and Patrick in disguise and rips off their faces. This is the last straw for the guards, who strap Mrs. Puff into a straitjacket and throw her in a padded cell for solitary confinement, convinced she's completely lost her sanity. Despite this, she is glad to finally be alone and away from SpongeBob, but suddenly his face appears all over the walls and floor of the padded cell and begins laughing at her.Mrs. Puff screams in horror at the incessant laughing as the scene transitions back to SpongeBob driving off the cliff and crashing into the fruit punch truck, once again flooding the rest home. Mrs. Puff stumbles out of the wreckage and is confronted by the police again, but to her surprise they arrest SpongeBob instead of her. From this, she concludes that her prison sentence was merely a hallucination and is happy that she's not going to jail, but after a police officer informs her that she \"already did [her] time\", Mrs. Puff suddenly sees herself wearing a prison uniform with a chain on her ankle.She once again screams in horror as the scene transitions back to her sitting in the boat going off the cliff again, seemingly having suffered another hallucination, but this time she sees Donna, a prisoner with a masculine voice from her first hallucination, driving the boat instead of SpongeBob. Screaming yet again, the scene transitions back to Mrs. Puff sitting in the boat driving off the cliff, this time with SpongeBob behind the wheel and no police cars behind them. Exasperated, Mrs. Puff says \"oh, forget it,\" immediately closing the episode.",

        "transcript": "[The episode starts at the boating school and Mrs. Puff is panicking while SpongeBob is in his driving test again and destroying stuff, as usual.] SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff! This is the one! This is the one! Come on, SpongeBob! Think! Think! Uhh... [destroys the lighthouse] Turn that way! Turn that way! No, turn that way! Right! Left! Oh no! No! [destroys the school building] Come on, don't ever do that! Come on! [a nuclear explosion is heard and a mushroom cloud appears] No! I'm ready! I can do this, Mrs. Puff! I can do it! I can do it! [flies through the entrance while driving, constantly destroying it, leading the fences falling down] Mrs. Puff: The driving test is over, SpongeBob. Stop the boat! SpongeBob: Wait, I can do this, Mrs. Puff! I can do this! Mrs. Puff: [SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff are out of the road] The road, SpongeBob, get back on the road! SpongeBob: [while struggling to get back on the road] Gotta pass the test! Gotta pass! [Mrs. Puff is screaming as the boat goes through a cart of watermelons and crashed it] Sandals: Hey, what do you got against the melons? Mrs. Puff: Look out! SpongeBob: [has a watermelon on his face] This must be the night driving part of the test. [Scene cuts to two police officers Nancy and Malley (Orange) using their nightsticks on hitting something offscreen] Officer Nancy: We're gonna straighten you out! Officer Malley (Orange): This'll fix ya! [They grunt as they hit a parking meter for repairs until it's straight and fixed] Now let's get that one. [points his nightstick at another broken and crooked parking meter. SpongeBob and a screaming Mrs. Puff drive by through a building, knocking it over] Officer Nancy: Barnacles, did you see that?! Officer Malley (Orange): Yeah. That guy had no front license plate. Let's get him. [SpongeBob looks back at the numerous police cars chasing behind him and Mrs. Puff] SpongeBob: Hey, look at all those police! I wonder if the president's in town. Mrs. Puff: [gasps] Look out! [Scene cuts to the mayor cutting a ribbon at the end of a bridge that is not finished] Mayor: It is with great pride that I officially open this unfinished bridge! [SpongeBob drives through the ribbon and rips it before he cuts it. The crowd of people that are gathering around the mayor take pictures. SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff do not make it on the other side of the unfinished bridge so they fall to the bottom as Mrs. Puff still screams] Mrs. Puff: Where did I go wrong?! [flashback to Mrs. Puff's first day of her new boating school] With the opening of my new boating school, I pledge that as long as a student is willing to learn, I shall never give up. [SpongeBob walks up to meet her] SpongeBob: Hi, I'm SpongeBob SquarePants. [scene cuts back to Mrs. Puff, who is still screaming. Scene then shows a retirement home where a fish in a white coat is yelling at a truck that has fruit punch] Shady Shoals Caretaker: Hurry up with that truckload of fruit punch! The seniors are getting cranky! [fish looks up and notices SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff crashing into the truck] Mrs. Puff: Alive! I'm alive! Oh, thank Neptune, I'm still...! [Suddenly, a Police squad car smashes down on the boat mobile. The other Police squad cars fall on and around the truck and others fall on the ground. The truck falls over on its side as all the fruit punch comes pouring out] Feminine Tom: [inside the retirement home, he is opening windows] Alright, seniors, let's open these windows so the world can see your nice white clothes. [Fruit punch pours in and everyone screams. Scene cuts to Fred, who is mopping the hallway and listening to \"Surfin' Summer\" by Richard Myhill on his headphones. The fruit punch fills the hallway, drains, and Fred is still mopping the same spot. Scene cuts to an elderly fish man, who is writing on some paper made out of red ink from his red pen] Elderly Fish: Oh, it's finally finished! A memoir of my life, written in red ink. [red punch comes flowing in, making his memoir papers soggy and red] Aww, barnacles! [Scene cuts back to outside where all the mess is] Mrs. Puff: Ow. SpongeBob, are you okay? SpongeBob: That depends. Did I pass? Officer Nancy: Freeze, you're under arrest! Mrs. Puff: Hold it, you can't arrest him! He's just a student driver! Officer Nancy: We're not talking about him! [Scene cuts to nightfall and Mrs. Puff wearing a prison uniform, being locked up in jail from the Bikini Bottom Jail] Mrs. Puff: But I don't belong here! It's all a big mistake! Prisoner Female #1: Yeah, I don't belong here, either! Prisoner Female #2: Me too! I'm innocent! Prisoner Female #3: [yelling in a butch Southern drawl] I belong here! [this triggers some other prisoners to complaining about their not belonging here too. Mrs. Puff walks over and sits down on the bed] Mrs. Puff: Okay. You can do this, Puff. You can get through this without losing your sanity. Oh, that's a road we don't want to go down again. Positives. Think of the positives. Let's see... I've got no more papers to grade. Yeah! [laughs then jumps to the floor] In fact, no more work. No more boating school classes. No more driving, no more SpongeBob... [Mrs. Puff's brain clicks and a sonar ping is heard] No more phone solicitors, no more SpongeBob! No more company potlucks, no more SpongeBob! [gets into bed] No more road rage, no more SpongeBob! No more insurance payments, no more SpongeBob! No more SpongeBob! [laughing] No more SpongeBob! [screaming maniacally] No more SpongeBob! [sighs] I think I'm going to like this place. [Scene cuts to her boating school, which is now deserted and dusty, with SpongeBob the only one in the room] SpongeBob: Class just isn't the same without Mrs. Puff. Just the thought of her alone and afraid in jail makes me think about her being alone and afraid in jail. I don't know how she's going to survive. [scene cuts to Mrs. Puff with a happy expression] Mrs. Puff: [hums while breaking rocks. Scene cuts to her making license plates] ♪Smelling the pretty roses, whoo hoo hoo.♪ [scene cuts to her lifting weights] ♪Haaappiness is just two kinds of ice creeeeam!♪ [cuts back to SpongeBob] SpongeBob: Oh, that poor woman. And it's all my fault. Maybe if I go talk to Patrick, he can ease my guilt. [Scene cuts to the outside of Patrick's rock] Patrick: Well, it sounds like it's all your fault. SpongeBob: Oh, you're right! Mrs. Puff's in jail and it's all because of me! I'm such a barnacle head! [Patrick takes one of his dots and puts it in the place of where his nose would be if he had one] Poor Mrs. Puff. I know, I gotta get her out! But to get her out of jail, first we gotta get in jail. Patrick: How are we gonna do that? [Scene cuts to the First Nautical Bank] SpongeBob: Alright, put the money in the bag! [he is in the bank, wearing a sock over his head, with a bag in his hands, facing the wrong way.] Put it in! Nat: [as a bank teller] Umm, you're facing the wrong way, sir. SpongeBob: [turns around and laughs, then yells again] Alright! Give me the money! Nat: Will that be from your savings or your checking account, sir? SpongeBob: Uhh, savings. Nat: May I please see some identification? SpongeBob: Sure. [takes out a card and gives it to the bank teller] Here ya go. Nat: Thank you. [SpongeBob's Jellyfishers Club Membership card is shown. As the bank teller types on the cash register, SpongeBob lifts up the sock on his head and gives Patrick a thumbs up] ...Sir, we are showing a balance of zero dollars and zero cents for both of your accounts. SpongeBob: Oh. Nat: Next! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk out of the bank] SpongeBob: Well, that went better than expected. Patrick: Yeah! I didn't think we'd get Mrs. Puff out of jail this fast! [SpongeBob's eyes rip through the sock. Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick now disguised as yellow and pink rocks] SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get into jail this time. [a truck full of rocks drives up] Fish: Hey, there's a couple. [gets out and throws the two rocks in the truck] Guard: Put your back in it, girls! [women prisoners are crushing rocks outside. The truck arrives and unloads more rocks] SpongeBob: Look, Patrick, there she is! [both jump over to Mrs. Puff where she is about to hit them] Mrs. Puff, wait, it's us, SpongeBob and Patrick! Mrs. Puff: That's funny. For a second, I thought that yellow rock talked to me. And its voice sounded a lot like... SpongeBob: SpongeBob. It's me, SpongeBob. [Mrs. Puff screams as she throws the pickaxe behind her] We're gonna bust you out of here. C'mon, Mrs. Puff! [Mrs. Puff starts shaking] Mrs. Puff: It's you. What are you doing here? Why did you follow me in here? Why?! [the first guard walks up, with Mrs. Puff's pickaxe in his head] Guard #1: Alright, Mrs. Puff, it looks like this heat's gone to your head. If you're gonna talk to rocks, I guess it's time for you to go on kitchen duty. Mrs. Puff: Yes, it must be the heat. Yes. [walks off] SpongeBob: Darn it! Okay, Patrick, let's get out of here. [a woman prisoner walks over] No, wait! [she smashes the two rocks into pieces] There goes our deposit on these costumes. [scene cuts to lunchtime where Mrs. Puff is serving chili to the prisoners.] Mrs. Puff: There you are. [a woman with a deep voice walks up to Mrs. Puff] Donna: Hey there, Puff Mama. What's today's grub? Mrs. Puff: Hi, Donna. It's chili, same as always. Let me get you some. [scoops up SpongeBob's nose and Mrs. Puff gasps] SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob! Mrs. Puff: When are these horrific hallucinations going to end? [SpongeBob gets out of the chili] SpongeBob: No, it's really me! [pulls Patrick up out of the chili] I brought Patrick along too. Patrick: Hi. Mrs. Puff: Why? SpongeBob: 'Cause we're gonna set you free! Mrs. Puff: No, I mean, why'd you bring him? [Patrick eats some chili] SpongeBob: He likes chili. Now quick, get in before someone sees. [makes a rectangle-shaped entrance in the chili] Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I am not going with you. SpongeBob: [laughs] That's a good one, Mrs. Puff. Now hop in. Come on! Patrick: SpongeBob, I think she means it. SpongeBob: Oh, that's crazy, Patrick. Mrs. Puff: He's right, SpongeBob. I'm staying. SpongeBob: But why? Mrs. Puff: I like it here. These are my people! [cut to a shot of some angry, gruff looking women prisoners] And besides, if I'm in here, that means I won't have to deal with yooou... [we see SpongeBob sad. He is sniffling as a single teardrop falls from his eye, almost crying in the chili] …uranium! In the water supply. [whips out a glass of water] See? Crystal clear! [guzzles the water and tosses away the glass] Aahhhh! SpongeBob: Excuse us just one second, Mrs. Puff. [to Patrick] Patrick, she has lost it! She's completely institutionalized. She's forgotten what it's like to live on the outside. To not be in prison. [Scene cuts to Frankie Billy in traffic, then at his desk for work from the office, and then staring out his bedroom window at night] Frankie's wife: Coming to bed, honey? Frankie Billy: Yes, dear. [Scene cuts back to SpongeBob and Patrick] SpongeBob: We've got to remind her that there is a life other than this. Mrs. Puff, if you come with us, I'll stay after school and decorate the whole classroom. Mrs. Puff: For the last time, no! [SpongeBob and Patrick disappear inside the chili as a guard walks up] I'm not going with you! That's final! [notices the guard] Oh. [laughs nervously] Guard #1: Talking to inanimate objects again, huh, Puff? Hmph. Get back to your cell. No more kitchen time for you. [Mrs. Puff walks off sad. SpongeBob and Patrick watch her. Scene cuts to Mrs. Puff burning coal into wire hangers until SpongeBob and Patrick come down the conveyor belt] SpongeBob: Quick, Mrs. Puff, hop on! Mrs. Puff: Guards! Guards, come quick! [the guard runs over to her] There's a crazed ex-student of mine and his overweight friend here to break me out! Guard #1: That's just raw material used to make coat hangers. You need some rest. [grunts as he pushes the level down, squishing SpongeBob and Patrick, which fills the room up with steam.] [Scene cuts to Mrs. Puff brushing her teeth. SpongeBob and Patrick come up from the toilet] SpongeBob: Psst! [Mrs. Puff screams] Hop in, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: Guards! Guards, come look! [a guard runs over and sees SpongeBob and Patrick in the toilet] Guard #1: Whoa. They don't pay me enough to do this job. [The guard flushes the toilet, sending SpongeBob and Patrick into the sewers. Cuts to Mrs. Puff in her bed. SpongeBob and Patrick peek from the top bunk] SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, up here. Mrs. Puff: Guards, guards! They're back! [two guards walk up] Guard #1: What's all the hubbub, Puff? Mrs. Puff: They're back! [the guards remove their heads, because they're just costumes, showing them as SpongeBob and Patrick] SpongeBob and Patrick: Mrs. Puff, it's us! [both wink and give her a thumbs up] Mrs. Puff: [screams and cries as the two real guards run up] Guard #1: What the barnacle is going on? Mrs. Puff: Get away from me! Get away! Guard #1: What are you talking about, Puff? Mrs. Puff: You can't fool me! You're SpongeBob and that guy who likes the chili. [rips off the guards' faces leaving their skulls shown] Guard #1: Let's face it, Puff. You've gone off the deep end. [Scene cuts to a second guard throwing Mrs. Puff, who is in a straitjacket, in a small, yellow square room] Guard #2: Get in there, you! You need a nice long stay in solitary confinement! [slams the door, which makes a squeaking sound] Mrs. Puff: Oh, well. Let's look at the positives again. I'm finally away from those two. Yes. All alone in my nice, soft room. SpongeBob: Made of sponge! [laughs. The room is made of yellow sponge as SpongeBob's face appears on all sides of the wall. Mrs. Puff screams as the scene goes back to SpongeBob driving in mid-air with the police behind them again.] I can pass the test, Mrs. Puff! I can pass the test! [The boats crash into the truck full of fruit punch, knocking it over, and spilling again] Officer Malley (Green): Freeze! Your joyride's over, punk. [police officers walk over] Mrs. Puff: No! What? [policemen arrest SpongeBob this time, because he now failed the driving test] Huh? What? SpongeBob: No. No! What are you doing?! Help! Help! [As the officers carry him to the jail vehicle, he kicks his legs.] No, no, please! No! I have a snail to feed! I can't go to jail now! This is not a good time! No, please, please! I'm not a criminal! [They throw him into the back of the police car, then drives off to jail] Mrs. Puff: I can't believe it. It was all a dream. I'm not going to jail! Officer Malley (Orange): Why would you go to jail? You already did your time. [zoom out to reveal Mrs. Puff wearing prison striped clothes of black and white with a prison ball chained to her ankle. She screams as the scene goes back to her screaming while the boat is in mid-air again as she's driving it with the police behind her] Mrs. Puff: Huh? Oh... it's just my imagination again. [zooms out to show Donna driving the boat] Donna: So, what's for dinner tonight, Puff Mama, chili? [Mrs. Puff screams again as the scene goes back to her with SpongeBob driving the boat in mid-air one last time, but without the police cars behind them] Mrs. Puff: Huh? What? Huh? Ah, forget it. [the episode ends]",

        "synopsis": "One night, SpongeBob and Gary watch a scary movie called Night of the Robot, which involves robots taking over the world. Gary tells SpongeBob that he should not watch it, as scary movies freak him out, but SpongeBob denies this. However, he later shakes in fear in bed, wondering if everyone he knows is a robot. After asking Gary if he is a robot, SpongeBob decides he has nothing to worry about and tries to get some sleep, but he has a nightmare about the same robot from the movie chasing him.The next day at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob has become very paranoid and believes that robots are \"everywhere\" with every sound jumpscaring him. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is in his office, listening to \"Electric Zoo\" on his portable radio. Mr. Krabs likes the song and hums to it. SpongeBob later walks past Mr. Krabs' office and overhears him saying he feels \"completely recharged.\" He then witnesses Mr. Krabs talking to his radio, talking in a \"robot\" language over the phone, and doing a bizarre robot-like dance to the song.This convinces SpongeBob to believe that Mr. Krabs is a robot imposter, and he relays this information to Squidward. Squidward does not believe him, so SpongeBob tries several tests to prove that Mr. Krabs is a robot. First, he tests Mr. Krabs' sense of humor by having Squidward tell a joke, but Mr. Krabs does not laugh. SpongeBob says that this is because he is a robot, as robots do not laugh, but Squidward says that \"he's obviously heard it before.\"SpongeBob then tests Mr. Krabs' emotions by telling him that Squidward's father never hugged him to see if he will cry. Mr. Krabs says that although it is a little sad, Squidward can hug himself during his break. This further worries SpongeBob, but Squidward says that this is ridiculous and that his father loved him very much. This reminds SpongeBob of the third and final test: the love test. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that Squidward loves him, but he simply tells him to get back to work. Back in his office, Mr. Krabs' radio breaks and he decides to give the batteries to Pearl for her Christmas present. A timer rings, and he grabs a pair of tongs and removes his hard-boiled egg from a pot of boiling water, ready to eat it. But just when Mr. Krabs is about to put some salt on the egg, he is startled when SpongeBob calls out his name a fourth time, and he accidentally tosses the full saltshaker into his eyes, causing him to scream in pain.Squidward then asks SpongeBob what the robots in the movie looked like. SpongeBob says that they had red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and ran on batteries. Squidward then asks if Mr. Krabs looks anything like that, and this is (seemingly) answered when Mr. Krabs barges out of his office screaming in pain with glowing bloodshot eyes, the tongs he used to hold the egg, and the radio batteries in his pocket. As Mr. Krabs runs to the bathroom, Squidward finally believes SpongeBob, and tells him to call the Navy, but due to their automated phone service, SpongeBob thinks that the robots have taken over the Navy. Squidward then announces over the microphone that robots are taking over the world, causing all the customers to flee the Krusty Krab.Mr. Krabs then emerges from the bathroom, relieved that his eyes are not hurting anymore, and goes back to his office, not noticing that the Krusty Krab is now empty. Squidward then wonders how they will find out what happened to the \"real\" Mr. Krabs, and SpongeBob says that the main character in the movie teamed up with a buddy and they got the poop on, or collected information from, the robot. After reading a book on How to Torture, the two go into Mr. Krabs' office and tie him up, demanding to know where the \"real\" Mr. Krabs is. After getting no answers and Mr. Krabs insisting that he is the real Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob and Squidward decide to interrogate his machines, which include a blender, a toaster, a food processor, and a coffee maker.These, of course, do not give any answers either (due to being inanimate objects), and so, Squidward destroys them with a baseball bat. This greatly upsets Mr. Krabs, as he paid good money for each of them (except for the coffee maker as he claims it was actually a gift), and he finally breaks down crying when SpongeBob brings in his most valuable \"robot\": The cash register. He also mentions laughing with it and loving it, revealing that he is not a robot. Seeing that Mr. Krabs really is telling the truth, Squidward then asks SpongeBob how the movie ended. SpongeBob, while thinking the ending was great, remembers that the ending revealed the robot invasion was just in the characters' imagination and that there were no robots after all.Realizing his mistake, SpongeBob declares that it is time to feed Gary and runs off, leaving Squidward to take the heat from Mr. Krabs for pointlessly destroying the machines. As a nervous Squidward grabs a broom and begins sweeping the mess, a furious Mr. Krabs growls and screams \"Squidward!\" as the episode ends.",

        "transcript": "[At night, SpongeBob is watching a movie at his house while eating popcorn.] TV narrator: We now return to tonight's Creepy Time Theater presentation of Night of the Robot . Man on TV: [screaming while being chased by a giant robot] SpongeBob: Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on. Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out. [scene cuts to SpongeBob lying in his bed, whimpering and shivering] What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary? [Gary is sleeping] Psst, Gary? Gare-Bear? [pokes Gary's eye, causing him to wake up] Gary: Meow! SpongeBob: Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right? Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep. [goes to sleep, and dreams about running from the giant robot from the movie earlier] [The scene cuts to the next day at the Krusty Krab, with SpongeBob in the kitchen, panting.] SpongeBob: [looks to his left] Robot! Oh my gosh! [robot turns out to be a sack of potatoes, a dust pan and broom, and a bucket] Huh? [chuckles nervously] [The scene cuts to Mr. Krabs holding down his money on his office desk.] Mr. Krabs: How about a little music to count me money to? [turns on the radio that is next to him] Radio DJ: [from the radio] And now for the number-one song in Bikini Bottom: \"Electric Zoo.\" [Techno beat plays from the radio. Mr. Krabs starts counting his money.] Mr. Krabs: Hey, that's pretty catchy. Bee-bee-boo-bop, bee-bee-boo-beep. Yeah, that's not bad. I love this young people's music. [The scene cuts to the kitchen. A buzzer on the fryer goes off.] SpongeBob: I surrender! Oh. Squidward: SpongeBob! [SpongeBob immediately screams. His hat flies onto Squidward's nose.] SpongeBob: Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose? Squidward: [removes the hat from his nose and puts it back on SpongeBob's head] I'm not wearing your hat on my nose; I'm waiting for Number 17's order! SpongeBob: Number 17... [holds up a tray with food] Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh? Squidward: [sarcastically] Hilarious. Just deliver the food. SpongeBob: [delivers the food to Incidental 64] There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you? Thaddeus: No, I'm not. SpongeBob: Well, keep your eyes peeled. [in a deep voice] They're everywhere. [back to normal voice] Back to work! [runs away, Incidental 64 shrugs his shoulders. SpongeBob walks by Mr. Krabs' office] Mr. Krabs: [from office] I feel completely recharged! SpongeBob: That sounds like Mr. Krabs. [peeks in the window] Mr. Krabs: Come on, little buddy, play it again. [shakes his radio] Please? One more time, for me. SpongeBob: That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels \"recharged.\" [laughs] If I didn't know better, I'd say he was... [scene zooms in on SpongeBob] ...a robot! Nah. Mr. Krabs: [calls the radio station] Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could play that song again. Radio DJ: [from the phone] Hmmm... which one, man? Mr. Krabs: The one that goes \"bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep.\" Radio DJ: No, man. You're thinking of \"bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-bop.\" Mr. Krabs: Bee-boo-boo-boo-boo-bop, [garbled telephone noise] bee-boo-boo-bop, [garbled telephone noise] boo-boo-bee-bop? [garbled telephone noise] Not bee-boo-boo-beep? [garbled telephone noise] Bop? [garbled telephone noise] Beep?! [garbled telephone noise] Boo-boo-bop?! [SpongeBob screams.] SpongeBob: Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's... [scene zooms in on him] ...a robot? Nah. [peeks into the window again and gasps] [Mr. Krabs does a robot dance on his desk as the radio plays the techno music.] SpongeBob: [jumps onto Squidward's arms] Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot! Squidward: [picks up SpongeBob off his arms] That's great, SpongeBob. Why don't you work on this problem back in the kitchen?! [throws him in the kitchen. Squidward laughs, but SpongeBob reappears beside him. Squidward is confused and looks around for how he did it] SpongeBob: I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too. Squidward: [confused] How did you...? SpongeBob: Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter] What is it, boy? SpongeBob: Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it. Mr. Krabs: Is it true, Squidward? Is it hilarious? Squidward: Umm... yeah, sure. Mr. Krabs: Well, let's hear it, lad. SpongeBob: Okay, here it goes! Uh, how'd it go Squidward? Squidward: [chuckles nervously] It went, um, uh, let's see, uh... why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie? Mr. Krabs: Why? Squidward: It was rated... [winks] ...\"Arr!\" [rimshot] [laughing] Arr! Because it's... about... pirates. Mr. Krabs: I'm not paying you to do stand-up, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work! [leaves] SpongeBob: [gasps] Not even a chuckle! See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's... [the scene zooms in on him] ...a robot! Squidward: There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob. He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie. Now why don't you... SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter again] What? What is it, boy? SpongeBob: Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad? [pretends to cry] Mr. Krabs: Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break! Now get back to work! [leaves again] SpongeBob: Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either. Squidward: SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much! SpongeBob: That's the final test, Squidward; the love test. Robots can't love. Squidward: No, wait, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter again] What is it, SpongeBob?! SpongeBob: I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you! [Mr. Krabs makes a blank expression on his face.] Mr. Krabs: Get back to work, Mr. Squidward. SpongeBob: [gulps] Squidward? [Mr. Krabs is at his desk writing something. Suddenly, the radio slows down and stops working. The radio breaks with black smoke and electronic breakage sound effect.] Mr. Krabs: Aw, me radio died! [takes out the batteries] Hmm, these batteries still have a little juice in 'em. I know! I'll give 'em to Pearl for Christmas. [puts the batteries in his back pocket. A bell rings and then Mr. Krabs walks over to a pot of boiling water] Me hard-boiled egg is ready! [picks up a pair of tongs] I can already taste it. Come to Papa. [takes the egg out of the water with his tongs] Got ya! And what good is a hot-boiled egg without a little salt? [picks up a salt shaker] SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs: [breaks the egg and accidentally tosses the full salt shaker into his eyes, then proceeds to scream in pain] Oh, my eyes! [continues screaming] SpongeBob: Mr-- [Squidward puts his hand over SpongeBob's mouth] Squidward: Will you be quiet? Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like? SpongeBob: Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries. Squidward: Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?! [Mr. Krabs barges out of his office, still screaming. He now has burning red eyes, the pair of tongs snipping in his claw, and the batteries in his pocket, just like the robot in the movie.] SpongeBob and Squidward: [both scream] Mr. Krabs: [continues screaming as he goes into the bathroom] Squidward: I'll evacuate the customers, you call the navy! SpongeBob: [runs over to the phone] Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy! Operator: Hello, you've reached the Navy's automated phone service. SpongeBob: Squidward, the robots are running the Navy! Squidward: Not the Navy! [over loudspeaker] Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world! [everyone is silent] Our world! [there's another brief moment of silence, then all the customers run out screaming] What do we do now? SpongeBob: I don't know! [notices a nickel] Hey, a nickel! [points at it] Squidward: SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Sorry. Mr. Krabs: [walks out of the bathroom, his eyes back to normal] Ah, that's better. [walks back to his office] Bee-boo-boo-boo-bee-bop, boo-boo-bop. Squidward: We need to find out what that robot did with the real Mr. Krabs, but how? SpongeBob: Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot. Squidward: They poop on the robot? SpongeBob: Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information. Squidward: I never thought I'd say this, but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop! [Squidward grabs the book titled \"How to Torture\" and reads it with SpongeBob. SpongeBob grabs some rope while Squidward grabs a hammer and a saw. SpongeBob also grabs some old comedy records. The scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' office, where SpongeBob and Squidward enter.] Mr. Krabs: Oh, hello, boys. [they are at the door with angry expressions on their faces] What can I do for you? [SpongeBob and Squidward lock the door] Heh-heh, why did you lock the door? [nervously as they slowly and menacingly approach him, camera shakingly zooms towards Mr. Krabs] Why do you have that rope? Who's watching the cash register?! [shot of outside the Krusty Krab where loud crashing and everyone screaming can be heard] Get your hands off me! [back in the office, Squidward ties Mr. Krabs to his office chair] SpongeBob! Squidward! What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant! Squidward: Shut up! [slaps Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs: Sweet Davy Jones, what the heck is going on?! Squidward: I said [slaps Mr. Krabs again] \"shut up,\" you bucket of bolts! SpongeBob: I can't take it! [runs off, crying] Squidward: SpongeBob, are you okay? SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch! Squidward: No, that's not Mr. Krabs. [shows that Mr. Krabs is trying to get out of his chair] That's Robot Krabs. SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Squidward: And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know. SpongeBob: Right. [runs up to Mr. Krabs and then slaps him] Squidward: SpongeBob, you gotta ask him a question first. SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear? [slaps him again] Squidward: SpongeBob, let me handle this. [turns a light on Mr. Krabs] Where's Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs: [confused] What are you talking about? I'm Mr. Krabs. [Squidward slaps him yet again] Squidward: We can do this all night if you want. Where's Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs! SpongeBob: Where's Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs! Squidward: Where's Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs: I am Mr. Krabs! I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am! SpongeBob: This is one stubborn robot. Mr. Krabs: [confused, then angrily yells] What?! [his yelling knocks over the lamp and SpongeBob] You think I'm a robot?! Squidward: We don't think; we know. Mr. Krabs: That's the silliest thing I ever heard! I am Mr. Krabs! Squidward: [walks over to SpongeBob] He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way. SpongeBob: I got an idea. [pokes Squidward's nose] Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robo-tricks. [runs out and returns later] If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will. [holds up a blender] Squidward: SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender. SpongeBob: Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his \"little buddy.\" Squidward: Oh, really? Put it on the table, SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs: You're gonna interrogate my blender? You're crazy. Squidward: We're just gonna see what your \"little buddy\" knows. [SpongeBob sets the blender on Mr. Krabs' desk. Squidward holds up a bat] Mr. Krabs: [panicking] No, wait! What are you gonna do to me blender?! That cost me money! Squidward: Where's Mr. Krabs? [shot of the blender] Not talkin', eh? [breaks the blender with the bat] Mr. Krabs: No! That cost me $24.95! SpongeBob: I guess it didn't know anything. Squidward: Go get the toaster. [SpongeBob gets the toaster then puts it on Mr. Krabs' desk] Mr. Krabs: No, not me toaster. That cost me $32.50! [Squidward breaks the toaster and then SpongeBob sets a food processor on the desk.] Mr. Krabs: $62.67! [Squidward breaks the food processor with the bat. SpongeBob picks up a coffee maker and puts it on the desk.] Mr. Krabs: [thinks a minute before replying] Four... well, actually, that one was a gift. [Squidward breaks the coffee maker, which causes Mr. Krabs to scream.] Mr. Krabs: No...! SpongeBob: [while trying to put the cash register on Mr. Krabs' desk] This is the last robot, Squidward! Mr. Krabs: No! Not my cash register! I raised it myself! I got it when it was just a little calculator! [crying] No! [sobbing and then sobbing louder] Squidward: I thought you said robots can't cry. SpongeBob: I also said they couldn't love. Mr. Krabs: [crying] I loved it like it was me own. SpongeBob: Uh, at least he's not laughing. Mr. Krabs: Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share! [crying] Squidward: SpongeBob, uh... how did that movie of yours end? SpongeBob: The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their... [slows down, as he realizes his mistake] imagination. [chuckles nervously, timpani noise, as if he anticipates Squidward to be angry at him, then checks his watch] Hey, it's time to feed Gary. [quickly runs off back home] [Squidward smiles nervously at Mr. Krabs and then grabs a broom and sweeps the broken pieces on the floor. Mr. Krabs becomes infuriated. The scene later exits from the office to the exterior of The Krusty Krab outside.] Mr. Krabs: [growls in fury, starting the background shaking] Squidward!",

        "synopsis": "SpongeBob is about to leave for boating school, when Patrick arrives to ask him to go jellyfishing. SpongeBob declines, but suggests that Patrick come to school with him, to which Patrick agrees. Upon arriving, SpongeBob shows Patrick around and explains their classroom's \"Good Noodle\" system, where stars are awarded to well-behaved students. SpongeBob has by far the most stars of anyone in the class. He also introduces Patrick to Roger, an egg in a terrarium with a lightbulb for warmth.When class starts, Mrs. Puff asks Patrick his name. Nervous, he replies with \"twenty-four\", which he and SpongeBob find incredibly funny and proceed to joke about during class. Mrs. Puff hears their jokes and catches them, letting Patrick off the hook with a warning since he is new, but gives SpongeBob a stronger warning, stating that she expects more from him. Patrick then draws an insulting depiction of Mrs. Puff and places it on SpongeBob's desk. Mrs. Puff, thinking the picture is SpongeBob's doing, removes one of his stars from the Good Noodle Board as punishment for two classroom disruptions, much to SpongeBob's horror. Mrs. Puff then tells SpongeBob to move to the back of the room, where Patrick continues to annoy him. When SpongeBob snaps upon being annoyed that Patrick pestered him only to say a less-than-significant \"hi\", an angry Mrs. Puff appears, sarcastically stating that SpongeBob can have his recess.At recess, SpongeBob blames Patrick for getting him in trouble, getting him sent to the back of the classroom, and for having his Good Noodle star removed. Patrick defensively states, \"Who cares about a stupid star?\". This results in the duo fighting in the hallway, until they are both sent to detention. During detention, the lightbulb keeping Roger alive burns out. At first, they refuse to even look at each other due to their previous disagreement, but frightened for Roger's life, SpongeBob and Patrick apologize and work together to save him. SpongeBob keeps Roger warm, while Patrick gets a new lightbulb.Just as they save the egg, Mrs. Puff appears, having seen the whole incident through her one-way chalkboard. She decides to give them one star each for having saved Roger. Patrick then states that he has mistaken boating school for Spanish class. After Patrick leaves, Roger hatches from the egg, presented as a live-action chick, and asks what he missed.",

        "transcript": "[The episode opens in the morning at SpongeBob's home. As SpongeBob is sleeping in his bedroom, the foghorn alarm sounds off.] SpongeBob: [turns off the alarm] Time for Boating School! Let 'er rip, Gary! [Gary pushes a button that sends SpongeBob jumping out of his bed, into the air. SpongeBob bounces off a chair, while sipping his cup of tea] Ah... [toast pop out into the air, where SpongeBob eats them. Gary spits SpongeBob's pants into the air where SpongeBob lands on a target that Gary has painted] Ta-dah! Not bad, partner in crime! The toast could have been a little darker, though. [Gary gives him an angry look. SpongeBob heads to the door] See you later! [opens the door where Patrick is standing there with a net in his hand] Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, want to go jellyfishing? SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have school today. Patrick: Well, what am I supposed to do all day while you're at school? SpongeBob: I don't know. What do you normally do while I'm gone? Patrick: [starts to cry] Wait for you to get back. SpongeBob: Wait a second, Patrick. Why don't you come to school with me? Patrick: Hey, that's a great idea! SpongeBob: You and me in school together as classmates! Think about it! [Patrick imagines a live-action Kindergarten Class photo of him and SpongeBob smiling goofy with each other] Patrick: Wow. [Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick entering Mrs. Puff Boating School.] SpongeBob: Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime. [shows Patrick Mrs. Puff's Boating School] Patrick: [laughs] And no line. SpongeBob: Behold, Patrick, the Hallway of Learning. [runs up to the water fountain] And this is the Fountain of Learning. [runs to the lockers] And these are the Lockers of Learning. Patrick: [runs up to some stairs] And these are the Stairs of Learning, right? SpongeBob: No, they're just the stairs. [walks over to another set of stairs] These are the Stairs of Learning. Patrick: Where is everyone? SpongeBob: I don't know. Home, probably. Class doesn't start 'till 9:00. Patrick: [suddenly shown with a watch, and looks at it] 6:20? But I thought you said you were late. SpongeBob: Late for being early. Patrick: Hey! [looks at his watch] When did I start wearing a watch? SpongeBob: [both walk into the classroom] And now, for the room with the most class: the classroom. Patrick: Oh... SpongeBob: [walks up to the chalkboard] And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain of Knowledge. Patrick: Oh. SpongeBob: [walks up to the Good Noodle Board] And those drinks are recorded here, on the Good Noodle Board. [looks at Patrick] Patrick: Huh? Uh, sorry. Oh! SpongeBob: [points to each star] Attendance. Penmanship. Basic Desk Sanitation. Advanced Desk Sanitation. I'll add your name so you can start collecting good noodle stars, too. [adds Patrick's name] There you are. Patrick: But look at all the stars you have! I'll never be that good. SpongeBob: Oh, now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. [clears throat, high pitched voice] Seventy-four... Patrick: Who said that? [runs over to an egg in a box] Was it him? SpongeBob: I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project. Patrick: What does he teach us? SpongeBob: The greatest lesson of all: the precious value of life. You see, Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat. [points the light bulb] This light bulb represents knowledge. And without its energy and warmth, within minutes, Roger would die. Patrick: [rapidly turns light on and off] Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick: [turns light back on] Sorry. [SpongeBob moves his desk to the front of the teacher's desk] SpongeBob: The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher. Think you can handle the second chair? Patrick: [jumps into the chair] I'm learning! SpongeBob: This is gonna be great! [SpongeBob and Patrick both giggle. Bubble transition to later during class.] Mrs. Puff: Hello, class, my name is Mrs. Puff. And the only reason I say that I see we have a new student. Young man, why don't you stand up and introduce yourself? Patrick: [confused] Who's the fat kid talking to? SpongeBob: You, Patrick, she's the teacher. Patrick: Oh. Mrs. Puff: Come on now, tell the class your name. Don't be nervous. [Patrick gets up and looks at the class] Patrick: Uh... uh... Mrs. Puff: We just want to know your name. [Patrick gets more nervous] Patrick: Uh... uh... uh... twenty-four! [class laughs hysterically] Mrs. Puff: [sarcastically] Oh, great, another genius... Patrick: [sits back down] Why are they laughing? SpongeBob: I guess it's just in the timing. Patrick: Oh. [Patrick laughs after a brief pause] Mrs. Puff: [writes on the chalkboard] Today's first lesson will be on turning. Patrick: [whispering] Twenty-four. [both start to giggle, and Mrs. Puff pauses and continues writing] SpongeBob: [whispering] Hey, Patrick. Patrick: [whispering] What? SpongeBob: [whispering] I thought of something funnier than twenty-four. Patrick: [whispering] Let me hear it. SpongeBob: [stifled laugh] Twenty-five! [both try and fail to hold in their laughter. Patrick goes red in the face while SpongeBob bangs his fist on his desk] Mrs. Puff: [overhears] That's enough! [they immediately stop laughing] Young man, this is your first day, so I'll let you off with a warning. As for you, SpongeBob, I expect more from a good noodle. Pay attention. SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: Now then, \"Turning\"; what every driver should know. When you are turning, it is important to signal at least... [Patrick places a paper on SpongeBob's desk] SpongeBob: [looks at the drawing Patrick gave him of Mrs. Puff and gasps] Big Fat Meanie? Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher! Mrs. Puff: What about the teacher? [SpongeBob screams then shivers and bites his lip in fear as Mrs. Puff sees Patrick's drawing of her. She appears in the same shape as Patrick's drawing.] As if I really look like this! [puts it in a drawer with a bunch of other bad drawings of her. Then she returns back to her original shape.] SpongeBob, I believe you know the punishment for two classroom disruptions. [takes out a scraper] SpongeBob: No... Mrs. Puff: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. But if one wishes to be a good noodle, one must behave like a good noodle. [walks over to the Good Noodle Board] SpongeBob: [starting to cry] I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle! Mrs. Puff: [about to remove the star] You'll get this star back when you earn it. SpongeBob: [wailing] No...! [As Mrs. Puff positions the scraper under the star and begins to peel it off, SpongeBob goes berserk, bouncing up and down in his seat and banging his head on his desk, constantly panting as he bangs his head.] [SpongeBob's head spins around on his body as Mrs. Puff slowly removes the star.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! [When the glue holding the star to the board stretches to the point of it snapping off the board, SpongeBob's eyes roll to the back of his head and he faints, sliding out of his seat onto the floor.] Patrick: [raises his hand] Mrs. Puff, is it naptime? Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I've had enough of your nonsense. Now collect your things and move to the available desk in the back of the room! SpongeBob: But... me? But why? Mrs. Puff: Because the Big Fat Meanie said so. Now go! SpongeBob: [mad] Thanks a lot, Patrick. Patrick: Sure thing, buddy. [SpongeBob walks to the back. His classmates are staring at him] SpongeBob: Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here. [Mrs. Puff's voice is receding as SpongeBob tries to listen from the back] It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway? [reads the writing on the desk] \"SKOOL is 4 CHUMPS.\" [horrified] Where am I?! Patrick: [whispering] Psst, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: [to self] Just ignore him, SpongeBob. Patrick: [whispering] SpongeBob, over here. SpongeBob: Whatever you do, don't look at him. Patrick: Psst, SpongeBob! [grunts as he throws a piece of wadded-up paper at SpongeBob] Psst, SpongeBob! [throws a book at SpongeBob] SpongeBob? [spits a bunch of spitballs on SpongeBob's face] SpongeBob? Psst, over here. I'm trying to tell you something. Something important. SpongeBob: [whispers loudly] What?! Patrick: [meekly] Hi. SpongeBob: [screams with fury] HI?! [growls, removing all the spitballs, then stops when he sees Mrs. Puff angry, covered in the spitballs] Mrs. Puff: Perhaps this would be a good time for recess. [Bubble transition to SpongeBob at his locker. Patrick walks up to him.] Patrick: Hey, buddy. Funny stuff in there, funny stuff. SpongeBob: [furiously slams his locker] There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars! Patrick: [frowning] Who cares about a stupid star? SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, considering you are one! Patrick: I'll deal with you after class! SpongeBob: It is after class! [a group of students crowd around SpongeBob and Patrick chanting \"fight\"] Patrick: I don't see anyone fighting, do you? SpongeBob: They're talking about us! We're fighting! Patrick: Well, don't mind if I do! [both start to punch. The group of students start to quiet down as they notice SpongeBob and Patrick are punching, but no hits are landing] Student: This is embarrassing. [everyone leaves as Mrs. Puff walks up] Mrs. Puff: [lifts SpongeBob and Patrick] What's going on here?! [looks at Patrick] Well? Patrick: SpongeBob and I were fighting. Mrs. Puff: [gasps] Fighting? [puts them down] Well, I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob SquarePants, I hereby sentence you and your friend [lights dim on Mrs. Puff and scary music plays] to detention! SpongeBob: Detention?! [after school] Mrs. Puff: May Neptune have mercy on your soul. [turns off the flashlight she was holding] [Bubble transition back to the classroom where SpongeBob, sitting at the front, and Patrick, sitting at the back, are serving detention time.] SpongeBob: [sulking] In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg. [angrily] It's all Stupid Patrick's fault. [turns to look at Patrick] I hate you, Patrick. Patrick: I hate you more. SpongeBob: I'd hate you no matter what. Patrick: Yeah, well, I'd hate you even if I didn't hate you. SpongeBob: [stares at Patrick for a few seconds, then narrows his eyes] I'd hate you even if that made sense. Patrick: I'd hate you even if you were me. That's how much I hate you. SpongeBob: I'd hate you, even if, uhh... [tries to think of something else to say] Um, I'd hate you... [points to Roger's tank] even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out. [The camera quickly pans over to where SpongeBob is pointing. Suddenly, the light bulb flickers, and then burns out and the electricity crackles] Huh? [SpongeBob bites his lip and starts shivering. He glances over at Patrick. Patrick is sitting at his desk about to cry.] Patrick: Ohh... [He starts to turn to look at SpongeBob, but when he sees him, he quickly looks away from him, crossing his arms.] Hmph. [SpongeBob watches Patrick, surprised, then does the same. But then he sees Roger's egg shivering in his tank and really starts to panic. We then see that it's snowing in Roger's tank. Snow is piled up around Roger, who is shivering under a pile of snow. Sleigh bells jingle in the background.] Patrick: [teary-eyed again] Oh...! [cut back to Roger, who is frozen inside a giant ice cube, with wind blowing] [SpongeBob and Patrick begin to quietly sob. The camera closes-up on SpongeBob, then Patrick. Finally, unable to take it anymore, SpongeBob turns around in his desk.] SpongeBob: [turns to Patrick, crying] I'm sorry I called you a stupid star! Patrick: [also crying, talking fast] I'm sorry I got you in trouble and got you moved to the back of the class and got your Good Noodle Star removed and shot the spitballs! SpongeBob: I'm sorry your apology is so long! Patrick: Me too, let's save Roger! [they run to Roger] SpongeBob: [takes Roger] I'll keep him warm, and you get a light bulb from the supply closet. Patrick: [opens the door to the supply closet] Ah. Lightbulb! [there is a pile of light bulbs, but Patrick is looking at the one that is already plugged in at the top] But why does it have to be so far away? [begins to climb the pile of bulbs. SpongeBob tries warming up the egg by sitting on it, huffing and puffing on it, etc. while Patrick is still climbing the pile of light bulbs, wearing fancy clothing. Patrick finally reaches the top, blows a horn, removes his clothes, then runs down the pile with the light bulb] I'm coming, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Oh, where's Patrick? Aw, forget it. I've got to go find Roger some warmth. [runs into Patrick and both of their items are in the air] The light bulb! Without its warmth, Roger will die! Patrick: Roger! Without him, the light bulb will have nothing to warm! [both jump for the item that is closest to them and crash into the floor with an item in their hands. They put the light bulb and egg back where they were] SpongeBob: We did it, Patrick! We saved Roger's life! Mrs. Puff: [off-screen] Good job, boys! [turns on a light from behind the chalkboard] I saw the whole thing from behind my one-way chalkboard, and I couldn't be happier with your teamwork. I've decided to give you each one gold star. Although, I'm not sure what saving an egg has to do with Boating School. Patrick: Boating School? I thought this was Spanish class. See ya, SpongeBob. See ya, Big Fat Meanie. [leaves the classroom] Roger: [egg hatches] Hey, what'd I miss? [The episode ends.]",

        "synopsis": "Squidward is preparing for bed as he looks forward to a weekend of May's peace and quiet, especially with SpongeBob and Patrick deciding to go camping. However, he is extremely exasperated and disappointed to learn that they are camping in SpongeBob's front yard, right outside his window.Squidward confronts SpongeBob and Patrick in their tent, pointing out they cannot be \"camping\" if they are only ten feet away from SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob simply states that it does not matter where you camp, as long as you are in the wilderness. After getting the impression that the duo believe Squidward is not manly or qualified enough to camp, he impulsively decides to join SpongeBob and Patrick in their \"camping.\" Squidward attempts to demonstrate \"real camping\" as SpongeBob and Patrick take notes, but fails to set up his automated tent, so he decides to sleep under the stars.The gang begins roasting marshmallows while imitating astronauts. Squidward dismisses them and plans to get a can opener from his house so he can eat a can of Swedish Barnacle Balls. However, SpongeBob stops him from doing so, saying that \"it just doesn't seem to fit the camping spirit.\" Squidward grudgingly decides to eat the marshmallows, but Patrick repeatedly blows on his burned ones that are covered in fire, sending them flying into Squidward's face. SpongeBob then plays the \"Camp Fire Song Song.\" Squidward dislikes it and begins playing \"Kumbaya\" very badly on his clarinet. Suddenly, a terrified SpongeBob stops Squidward by shooting a marshmallow with his slingshot through his clarinet and into his windpipe, causing him to choke.After Squidward recovers, he yells at SpongeBob for hurting him. He claims that it is not safe to play the clarinet badly in the wilderness at night, as he might attract a sea bear. Squidward angrily protests that sea bears do not exist, but SpongeBob and Patrick insist that they are real, showing two newspaper articles of The Bikini Bottom Inquirer and Fake Science Monthly as proof where one newspaper says \"I Married a Sea Bear\" and the other says \"The Sea Bears and Fairy tales are Real!\" Squidward attempts to disprove their existence by having SpongeBob and Patrick list all the things which supposedly attract sea bears, such as stomping harder, eating cheese cubes, wearing a hoop skirt and clown shoes, using a sombrero in a ridiculous way, waving a flashlight back and forward quickly as its natural pray, etc. He then begins doing all these actions at once, despite SpongeBob and Patrick's pleas. He quickly draws an \"anti-sea-bear circle\" in the dirt to protect himself and Patrick, and Patrick tells that as it was shown on the 2nd newspaper of Fake Science Monthly that the article says, \"How to Stop a Sea-Bear!\"Squidward then gloats how a sea bear has not arrived, to which SpongeBob explains he forgot one thing: wearing a sombrero in a \"goofy fashion.\" Just then, a real sea bear appears and demonstrates how the hat should be worn upside down, much to Squidward's horror. Enraged, the bear mauls the shocked Squidward before leaving. SpongeBob and Patrick urge Squidward to jump into their circle, but he is skeptical of this and tries to flee, only to be attacked by the sea bear again for various reasons like walking and crawling.After being attacked for the sixth time, SpongeBob concludes the sea bear simply does not like Squidward. After failing to draw his own anti-sea-bear circle, Squidward finally leaps into SpongeBob and Patrick's. When the sea-bear appears again, it notices Squidward is now in the circle and growls at him in warning for now being safe, before leaving the area. Squidward is relieved the creature is finally gone and thanks SpongeBob and Patrick for saving his life as the trio celebrate.SpongeBob mentions they are lucky to not be attacked by a sea rhinoceros. Hearing this, Squidward fearfully asks what attracts them, to which Patrick replies, \"The sound of a sea bear attack.\" A sea rhinoceros then appears and growls at Squidward. SpongeBob remarks how lucky they all are to be wearing anti-sea rhinoceros undergarments, except for Squidward, who does not have a pair on, causing him to whimper in resignation and fear.",

        "transcript": "[The episode begins at nightfall at Squidward’s house. Squidward is preparing for bedtime.] Squidward: [enters his bedroom in nightgown, with book, and cup of tea] [sighs] Finally, the weekend is here. And this isn't just any old weekend, [gestures to \"Dance Quarterly\" calendar on wall] this is the weekend SpongeBob and Patrick go camping. Wouldn't it be great if they got lost in the woods and never came back? [thought bubble appears over Squidward] [In Squidward’s thought bubble, SpongeBob is hiking with Patrick, both have camping gear strapped to their backs. An owl hoots. SpongeBob and Patrick are worried] SpongeBob: [in Squidward's thoughts] Patrick, I'm scared! [Squidward’s thought bubble disappears] Squidward: Ho-ho, that would be great! [jumps into bed] You've waited a long time for this. A soft bed, warm tea, a good book, and two whole days with no... [laughs just like SpongeBob and imitates his goofy, big-eyed face] [Squidward hears SpongeBob's real laugh outside] Squidward: What the...?! [goes outside to find SpongeBob and Patrick in a tent, complete with sleeping bags and reading books, the two are laughing] SpongeBob, aren't you two supposed to be camping? SpongeBob: We are camping. Squidward: SpongeBob, it's not camping if you're ten feet from your house. [Camera zooms out to show tent's location] SpongeBob: Aww, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you're outdoors. While all those soft city folk are safe in their beds reading books, we're out here, pitting ourselves against the formidable forces of nature. You wanna join us? Squidward: No. SpongeBob: Okay. Have fun inside. [Squidward leaves; SpongeBob and Patrick pull their book back out, along with a flashlight, and begin to read and giggle] Squidward: [pops back into tent, glaring] What do you mean, \"have fun inside\"? SpongeBob: Just... have fun inside. See you tomorrow. Squidward: Oh. Bye. [Squidward exits; SpongeBob and Patrick resume reading; Squidward enters tent again and gasps] Squidward: You little sneak! I see what you're doing! SpongeBob: What? Squidward: Don't think I can't see what you're doing! SpongeBob: What? Squidward: You're saying I can't take it! SpongeBob: But all I... Squidward: [holds up tentacle] Ah! You're saying I'm soft! You think your little \"have fun inside\" challenge is gonna make me come camping with you, but that is never gonna happen ! There's no way I'm gonna sit out here all night with you two losers! So get used to it! [exits tent] SpongeBob: Okay. Have fun inside . Squidward: [pokes head back into tent, blowing SpongeBob and Patrick back with his loud voice] That's it, I'm in! I'll show you camping! [runs into his house] SpongeBob: [to Patrick] Squidward's gonna come camping with us! [both climb out of tent and giggle] Squidward: [emerges with large camping backpack] Now, you'll see how a real... [falls face forward on the ground, squished by the immense backpack] ...outdoorsman does it! [climbs out from underneath; pulls pouch from backpack] Here we are, my remote-controlled, self-assembling tent. Watch and learn. [SpongeBob takes out binoculars, Patrick a notepad and a pair of half-moon glasses; Squidward tosses pouch into the air and presses the remote, but the power fizzles and the tent appears, unassembled in a pile on the ground] SpongeBob: That was great, Squidward, but how do you get inside? Patrick: Yeah, it's all crushy-looking. Squidward: It isn't put up yet, you idiots. [grumbles, picking up the tent and fiddling around with it and accidentally rips it] Huh? SpongeBob: [still acting like he and Patrick are taking notes] Customization! Patrick: Genius! Squidward: [Squidward beats on the tent with a wooden stick] Bah! Bah! Bah! SpongeBob: He's tenderizing the ground! Patrick: Of course! [Squidward is still struggling with the tent] SpongeBob: Write that down! Write that down! [Patrick still appears to be taking notes, but there is just a tic-tac-toe game in progress on his notepad.] Squidward: [gives the pile a huge kick; it automatically becomes an assembled tent] Huh? Voila! [the perfect tent collapses to pile form again; Squidward pushes it out of the way] But what could compare to just lying out under the stars? [takes a lone blanket and places it on the ground; SpongeBob and Patrick applaud and cheer wildly and vigorously] Well, I've worked up an appetite as big as all outdoors. Time for a little grub. I suppose you two are gonna stew up some twigs and rocks, right? SpongeBob: [laughs] Nope, we've got something even better - Marshmallows. [pulls out \"Marsh King\" bag and pops a marshmallow into his mouth] Mmm-mm. Just like the astronauts eat. Patrick: [has round fishbowl over his head like the helmet of an astronaut suit; imitates static noise] Patrick to SpongeBob. Patrick to SpongeBob. Do you read me? Over. SpongeBob: [also has \"helmet.\" Imitates static noise] SpongeBob to Patrick. I read you. Over. Patrick: [static] Patrick to SpongeBob. I like going. [static] Over. SpongeBob: [static] SpongeBob to Patrick. [static] Me too. [Patrick and SpongeBob start to repeatedly exchange static noises. Squidward is annoyed.] SpongeBob to Patrick, help yourself. Over. [holds out Marsh King bag] Patrick: Yummy! [takes marshmallow and crams it into his mouth, smashing his \"helmet\"] Patrick to SpongeBob! The deliciousness has landed! Squidward: Well, you two astronauts can eat marshmallows. I'm gonna have a can of Swedish Barnacle Balls, [holds up, closely showing its full label] just as soon as I can get my can opener. SpongeBob: But Squidward, didn't you take a can opener when you hiked out here? Squidward: Why would I bother? We're ten feet from my house. SpongeBob: But this is the wilderness! It just doesn't seem to fit the camping spirit! Patrick: Pretty weenie . Squidward: Alright, alright! Gimme a marshmallow! [Squidward begins toasting his marshmallow lightly. Patrick, sitting across from him, sets his on fire and tries to blow on it to cool it down, but the marshmallow flies off and hits Squidward in the face. Patrick gets another marshmallow and repeats the same thing twice. After two marshmallows to the face, Squidward ducks and he laughs at his dodging, but the third marshmallow has a boomerang effect and hits Squidward in the back of the head] Squidward: Okay. Besides spitting molten food stuffs at me, what else do you do for fun? SpongeBob: Well, after a long day of camping, it's nice to unwind with a nice, relaxing campfire song. I call this one \"The Campfire Song Song.\" ♪Let's gather 'round the campfire and sing our campfire song. Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song. And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong. But it'll help if you just sing along...♪ Patrick: ♪Bum! Bum! Bum!♪ Both: [Patrick slightly behind SpongeBob in the words] ♪C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song! C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!♪ SpongeBob: ♪And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong! But it'll help if you just sing along...♪ Patrick: ♪Sing another song...♪ SpongeBob: ♪C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!♪ Patrick! Patrick: ♪SONG! C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E...♪ SpongeBob: Squidward! [silence] Good! ♪It'll help... it'll help... if you just sing along!♪ [SpongeBob smashes his ukulele like a guitar at the end of a rock show. Patrick does the same with his drum set] ♪Oh yeah!♪ Ahh, now, wasn't that relaxing? Squidward: No! This is relaxing. [holds up clarinet and begins playing \"Kumbaya\" awfully; SpongeBob and Patrick look alarmed] SpongeBob: Oh, no! [picks up marshmallow and holds it into a slingshot] I'll save you, Squidward! [SpongeBob slingshots the marshmallow at Squidward; it goes up his clarinet and sticks in the back of his throat; SpongeBob comes over to assist him.] SpongeBob: Squidward, are you all right? That's it, chew, chew, and swallow. There, better? Squidward: Better?! I was just fine until you lodged that ballistic junk food into my windpipe! SpongeBob: But I had to! It's too dangerous to play the clarinet badly out here in the wilderness! It might attract... [whispers] a sea bear. Squidward: [in a low, cautious tone] A sea bear? You mean like the ones that... [In an angry tone] don't exist ?! SpongeBob: What are you saying? Squidward: There's no such thing! They're just a myth! SpongeBob: Oh, no, Squidward, sea bears are all too real! It says so in the Bikini Bottom Inquirer ! [holds up cheesy tabloid newspaper] Squidward: [reads cover story] \" I Married a Sea Bear \"? Patrick: Yeah, and Fake Science Monthly ! [holds up newspaper] Squidward: [reads] \"Sea Bears and Fairy Tales Are Real\"? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard! Patrick: Well, maybe it is stupid, but it's also dumb! SpongeBob: Patrick's right, Squidward. Sea bears are no laughing matter. Why, once I met this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy's cousin... Squidward: You're right! I should be more careful. In fact, why don't you tell me all of the things I shouldn't do if I want to keep the sea bears away? SpongeBob: Okay, that's easy. First off, don't play the clarinet. Squidward: Okay. Then what? SpongeBob: Never wave your flashlight back and forth really fast. Patrick: Flashlights are their natural prey. Squidward: You're kidding. SpongeBob: Don't stomp around. They take that as a challenge. Patrick: Yeah. Squidward: [writes on notepad] Go on. SpongeBob: Don't ever eat cheese. Squidward: Sliced or cubed? SpongeBob: [whispers with Patrick] Cubed; sliced is fine. Squidward: Yeah, yeah, and? SpongeBob: Never wear a sombrero... Patrick: ...in a goofy fashion! SpongeBob: Or clown shoes. Patrick: Or a hoop skirt. SpongeBob: And never... Patrick: Ever... SpongeBob: Ever... Patrick: Duh! Both: Screech like a chimpanzee! Squidward: Wow! That's amazing how many things can set a sea bear off! Both: [huddling together, shuddering] They're horrible! Squidward: And... and suddenly I have the sense we're all in danger! Both: Why? Squidward: I don't know... [runs off and returns with a flashlight, clown shoes, hoop skirt, sombrero, and tray full of cubed cheese; a diabolical look is on his face] Just a feeling! SpongeBob: [horrified] No. Squidward: Yes. SpongeBob: No! [Squidward begins making chimp noises] Squidward: U! Uhuhu! Both: Squidward, please don't! [Squidward continues hooting, stomping, and waving flashlight around] Squidward: Uh! Uh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Patrick: SpongeBob, what are we gonna do? A sea bear's sure to come and eat us! SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick. I'll draw us an anti-sea-bear circle in the dirt. [takes stick and draws circle around himself and Patrick] Squidward: [continues to do screeching like a chimpanzee] Uh! Uh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Uh! Patrick: Good thinking! [holds up another issue of Fake Science Monthly] All the experts say it's the only defense against a sea bear attack. Squidward: [ends to screeching] Uh! Uh! Uh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [laughing] Ha! Ha! Ha! You guys are so gullible! See? I did everything that attracts a sea bear, and nothing happened! If sea bears really exist, why didn't one show up? SpongeBob: Maybe it's because you're not wearing your sombrero in a goofy fashion. Squidward: Oh, pfft, sorry! How silly of me! You mean like this? [Squidward tilts his sombrero to the right, laughing, but something off-screen takes the hat and turns it upside-down instead] SpongeBob: No. Like that. [Camera zooms out to show the sea bear that inverted Squidward's sombrero; it looks like a giant fish with the head of a bear and claws on its fins. Squidward sees the sea bear and screams while it roars and chases him while he runs; it begins to maul [off-camera] the screaming Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick are still huddled inside their anti-sea-bear circle] SpongeBob: Squidward, are you okay? Squidward: [looking bruised and battered] No. SpongeBob: Quick! Jump inside our anti-sea-bear circle before he comes back. Patrick: [brings the anti-sea-bear circle and drops it at his and SpongeBob's current position] Yeah. Sea bears often attack more than once. Squidward: Are you crazy? A dirt circle won't stop that monster! I'm running for my life! Both: No! [The sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward] SpongeBob: Don't run! Sea bears hate that! Squidward: Thanks for the tip. I guess I'll just limp home, then. Both: No! [The sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward] SpongeBob: They hate limping more than running! Squidward: Well, I guess I'll just have... [The sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward] SpongeBob: I should have warned you about crawling! [The sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward] Squidward: What'd I do that time?! SpongeBob: I don't know, I guess he just doesn't like you! Patrick: Pretend to be somebody else! SpongeBob: Here, draw a circle! [tosses Squidward the stick] Squidward: Okay! [The sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward] SpongeBob: That was an oval! It has to be a circle! Squidward: [runs and climbs on top of SpongeBob and Patrick, who are still sitting in the circle] Move over! [The sea bear comes up to Squidward in the circle, then notices the circle itself below before snarls as it points a threatening claw at him, and leaves] Squidward: Hey, it worked! You guys saved my life! SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward: Hooray! SpongeBob: Yeah, I'm glad it was just a sea bear. This circle would never hold back a sea rhinoceros. Squidward: What attracts them? Patrick: The sound of a sea bear attack. [A sea rhinoceros appears, snorting] SpongeBob: Heh, good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea-rhinoceros undergarments. Right, Squidward? Squidward: Huh?",

        "synopsis": "As the episode opens, Squidward is dreaming he is a great musician. Suddenly, his alarm clock goes off, waking him up. He prepares for another day at the Krusty Krab. While SpongeBob gets ready to go to work, he sees Squidward and asks him why he is playing his clarinet. Squidward says he is practicing for his performance tomorrow. Squidward keeps walking to work while SpongeBob visits Sandy. He finds Sandy with a machine that can transport things. Sandy shows SpongeBob how it works by teleporting an apple to Mrs. Puff's desk. SpongeBob asks Sandy if it can transport him to the Krusty Krab. She allows him to try it. When he gets there, part of Squidward's arm gets stuck in him. Suddenly, the machine's remote control goes haywire and burns out and SpongeBob and Squidward are transported back, fusing them.Sandy sees what has happened and is terrified. When they walk out, SpongeBob has his normal head/body, while Squidward's head is sticking out of the upper left. They are also in control of each other's arms; SpongeBob is controlling Squidward's hand, while Squidward is controlling SpongeBob's. Squidward tries to get out, but he cannot. He is scared of the fact he and SpongeBob are stuck together. SpongeBob says they can be together forever now, scaring him more. Squidward asks Sandy to do something. She decides to zap them back in the transporter. She zaps them to a school, a hospital, and an unnamed planet, but they are still stuck together. Squidward says she has to get them unstuck. Sandy tells Squidward she was working on a new invention, but it is not ready. He tells her to hurry because he cannot stay stuck to SpongeBob.She tells him to stay calm, and she will continue working on it. Squidward and SpongeBob are riding to work on a bike. SpongeBob says he will drive, but Squidward keeps getting hit by the wheel. They crash into the kitchen, and Mr. Krabs asks what happened. They stand up, revealing their morphed body. Mr. Krabs just tells them to get to work. They try working, but they cannot because they are stuck together. Mr. Krabs kicks them out and tells them not to come back until they fix their problem. SpongeBob says they still have each other, and Squidward angrily says that is how they ended up like this in the first place. Squidward practices playing clarinet while SpongeBob is sad. A surfer guy passes and says \"Rock on, Freaky Bro.\" They run over to Sandy's and ask her if she has found a way to fix them. Sandy says she has invented the Molecular Separator Ray. Squidward is ready to be free, but Sandy says the invention is not complete . She says she will probably have it ready the day after tomorrow. Squidward frantically puts his face on her helmet and tells her he has a performance tomorrow. So she tells him she will have it ready before he goes on. SpongeBob and Squidward try to go to their own houses, but they cannot due to being stuck.Squidward tries by force, but it pushes their houses together. At the clarinet performance the next day, Squidward is wondering where Sandy is. He thinks about giving up, but SpongeBob tells him this is his big chance to be a star. Squidward decides to wear a cloak to hide SpongeBob. He starts playing his clarinet, upsetting everyone. A loose nail pulls the cloak off, revealing their secret. Amazingly, the crowd loves this sight and starts cheering. Excited, Squidward basks at the moment as he finally knows what it feels like to be a star. Suddenly, Sandy shows up and tells Squidward she finished the device. Squidward tries to tell her not to, but she separates the two, displeasing the crowd. Squidward starts playing his clarinet again, but everyone except SpongeBob hates the sound of it.The crowd leaves in anger and disgust, except Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Pearl, Larry, and Mrs. Puff, as Squidward says his one moment of fame is gone. He yanks the machine from Sandy and tries to reverse it. Sandy tries telling him that it is a very sensitive device. Suddenly, the machine breaks and Squidward is morphed along with all those present. The episode cuts to Squidward in a psychiatrist's office.As the doctor asks Squidward to tell him what the problem is, he says that it all started when he was born. Before the episode closes, it is revealed that Squidward, together with SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Pearl, and Mrs. Puff are all horribly fused into a grotesque disgusted flesh-colored blob, much to his dismay.",

        "transcript": "[The episode begins with Dream Squidward having blonde hair and playing the clarinet while the crowd is cheering for him.] Incidental 8: Squidward, we love you! Audience Member #2: I love you, Squidward. You're my favorite! [Dream Squidward laughs as he does a crowd surf. The alarm goes off, and Squidward wakes up from his dream.] Squidward: Alright, alright. Time for another hideous day at work. Ahh, just hang in there, gorgeous. [Plays a few notes on his clarinet] Your star will shine at the clarinet recital tomorrow. [laughs] SpongeBob: Time for another glorious day at work. [winks at his tie, the tie winks back] Good morning, Squidward! [walks down the street with Squidward] And isn't it a lovely morning? Why are you playing the clarinet on your way to work? Squidward: I'm practicing for my clarinet recital. Soon, all of Bikini Bottom will recognize the talent that is Squidward Tentacles. Goodbye, SpongeBoob. SpongeBob: See ya at the Krusty Krab, Squidwart. Hey, Sandy, what's this? Sandy: Well, this here is my new matter transporter. It can move things from one place to another in the blink of an eye. SpongeBob: Ooh, that sounds fancy. Sandy: Let me show you how it works. [puts an apple in the transporter] SpongeBob: Whoa! [apple disappears] Where'd it go? Sandy: Just where you think it would be. [apple appears on Mrs. Puff's desk] Mrs. Puff: Oh! SpongeBob: Uh-oh, I'm late for work. Do you think your machine can zap me over to the Krusty Krab? Sandy: I always did want to try a critter. Sure, why not? Get in there, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo! [goes into transporter] Sandy: Hold on tight. SpongeBob: [transporter starts] Gee, Sandy, this sure feels... Squidward: [walking up to the Krusty Krab] Well, here we go again. [as he reaches for the door, SpongeBob appears and Squidward's arm is attached through SpongeBob's body] SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! [laughs. Sandy's remote is going haywire] Sandy: What's going on with this thing? [SpongeBob and Squidward get transported back to Sandy's machine] What in tarnation? [gasps. SpongeBob and Squidward are mutated into one body] SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy! Squidward: I'm not sure what it is, but something seems different about me. SpongeBob: Yeah, me too. Squidward: Hey! What are you doing with my hand? Wha-what am I doing with your hand? Daaaghh! What is this?! We're all... mixed-up together! [tries to detach himself, but fails] This is horrible! I have my clarinet recital tomorrow! SpongeBob: Oh, it's not so bad, Squidward. Now we can be best buddies and do everything together, forever. Squidward: [screams] Sandy, was this your doing? You've got to get us separated! Sandy: Well, I wish I knew how. Squidward: Well, you have to do something! I can't stay stuck to him ! Sandy: Hmmm, I wonder what would happen if I tried zapping you back in the transporter. Squidward: Uhh, yeah, yeah, yeah, good idea. Let's try it. Sandy: Well, here goes nothing. [transports to Bikini Bottom Elementary] Incidental 115: All right, children. Today's Timmy's birthday. You know what that means. Ready, Timmy? [opens present. SpongeBob and Squidward rise up from the box, still mutated together. Mable screams as SpongeBob and Squidward get transported again] Doctor: Congratulations, Mrs. Smith. You gave birth to a healthy baby boy. Incidental 63: May I see my baby? Doctor: Of course. [baby appears as SpongeBob & Squidward mutated into one body again. Incidental 63 screams as they are transported again] One-Eyed Monster: I've been in love with you ever since I first laid my eye on you. [both monsters kiss. SpongeBob and Squidward appear between them] Hey, baby, what's your name? [SpongeBob and Squidward get transported again. The lady monster slaps the one-eyed monster's face and leaves] Squidward: It's no use, Sandy. We're still the same. Sandy: Well, that's a darn shame. You know what, I was working on the blueprints for a new invention. But it's still in the embryonic stage. Squidward: Try anything! I cannot go to my clarinet recital like this. Sandy: I'll continue working on it. In the meantime, you boys keep your head up. SpongeBob: Together forever. Squidward: Misery. [later, SpongeBob and Squidward are riding a bike to work] SpongeBob, hasn't anyone taught you how to ride a bike? SpongeBob: Don't worry, I'll drive. Squidward: [Squidward's head bumps against the wheel of the bike] Ow, ow, ow. SpongeBob! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. [both enter the Krusty Krab riding the bike. The bike crashes into the boat and they fly through the kitchen window] Incidental 114: I gotta lay off the hot sauce. Mr. Krabs: [enters kitchen] What in blazes is going on in here? SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs: What are you two doing laying around? Get to work. Squidward: If you say so. [as they stand up, Mr. Krabs freaks out] Mr. Krabs: Egad! What happened to ya? Uhh, I don't want to know. Just go do your jobs. SpongeBob: Aye aye, cap'n! Squidward: Do you have to be such an accommodating buffoon? SpongeBob: Squidward, everybody knows I'm a sponge. I look nothing like a balloon. Squidward: I don't have time for this. I've got to man the cash register. [stretches his head through the kitchen window] Whew. Can I help you? Customer #2: Can I get two Krabby Patties, please? Squidward: SpongeBob, I need two Krabby Patties. SpongeBob: Two Krabby Patties coming right up. [notices the buns are out of reach] I can't... reach the buns. Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's the holdup?! SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on it. Mr. Krabs: Time is money, boy. SpongeBob: Time is money. Right. [reaches bun] Hello, bun. At last we meet. [Squidward can't hold the cash register. His head flies through the kitchen window, onto the grill and crashes into SpongeBob] And now for the- Mr. Krabs: Alright, that's it. I can't afford you jeopardizing me business. You two are more trouble than you're worth. [pushes them out the restaurant] And don't come back until you get this problem sorted out. SpongeBob: Look on the bright side, Squidward. At least we still have each other. Squidward: That's how we got into this predicament in the first place, you imbecile! Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like a moment of peace. [plays clarinet as they walk past a surfer] Surfer: Whoa, rock on, freaky bro! Squidward: Sandy! Sandy! Please tell me you've figured out a way to separate us. Sandy: Say hello to the 'Molecular Separator Ray'. Squidward: Hello, Molecular Separator Ray. Well, let's get on with it. My clarinet recital is tomorrow night. Sandy: Uhh, well, I'm not quite done with it yet. Squidward: What'd you say? Sandy: I'm still putting it together. At best I'll have it ready, uhh, the day after tomorrow? Maybe? [Squidward pushes Sandy's air helmet] Squidward: What?!? Day after tomorrow?! No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No! I have a performance tomorrow! I can't be stuck to that yellow freak! [SpongeBob smiles] Sandy, please, you've got to do it before the show! Sandy: Well, uhh, I suppose... I'll have it ready before you go on. [Squidward and SpongeBob stretch through their front doors, but can't walk much further, so their houses collide together] Squidward: Of course. [at the clarinet recital] Oh, my. [not an empty seat in the house] Where are you, Sandy? Sandy? I can't do it. I can't go out there. SpongeBob: Squidward, this is your moment. The story you will tell when you look back as a... superstar! Squidward: Superstar? SpongeBob: Now go out there and give them the best darn show they've ever seen! Squidward: You're right! The show must go on! Announcer: Ladies and gentlefish, Bikini Bottom's Community Rec Center is proud to present: Squidward Tentacles. [curtain rises to Squidward wearing a big cape like clothing. Squidward starts playing and everyone begins to hate it] Incidental 14: Honey, I'm scared. [the crowd continues to hate Squidward playing the clarinet, the cape comes off as a nail tears it. SpongeBob starts to see the crowd, the crowd gasps] SpongeBob: Uhh, hi. Incidental 37B: Whoa. Rock on, freaky bro! Yeah. Whoo! [crowd cheers] SpongeBob: Wow, they really liked it. Mr. Krabs: [laughing] There you go, Squiddy! Squidward: They... they... they're cheering. Superstardom. This must be what it feels like. This is what it looks like. What it [starts to laugh happily] sounds like. And... [smells the air] ...what it smells like. Oh, simply intoxicating. Sandy: Whoo-wee, there you boys are. Looks like I'm just in time. SpongeBob and Squidward: Sandy? Sandy: One blast of this Molecular Separator Ray and you'll be separated for good. [SpongeBob and Squidward try to tell Sandy not to blast them, but was too late, she blasts the ray at Squidward and SpongeBob and it separates them. Crowd gasps] Squidward: [SpongeBob gives him back his clarinet] Hmph. [plays clarinet off-key making SpongeBob cheer for him, but the audience hates it as they block their ears, Old Man Jenkins faints off his chair] Incidental 87: I think I'm going to be sick! [Squidward blows his clarinet at Incidental 107, which blows his skin off and shows his skeleton] Incidental 107: Ah, I'm out of here! Squidward: Huh, no, wait. Wait! [everyone leaves] Oh, my one moment of fame... gone. [grabs the Molecular Separator Ray] There's got to be some way to reverse this. [pushes the button over and over] Sandy: No, Squidward! That's a very sensitive device! SpongeBob: Squidward, I wouldn't--! [laser blasts into the final scene] Therapist: So, what seems to be the problem, Mr. Tentacles? Squidward: It all started when I was born. [camera zooms out to show Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff, Pearl, SpongeBob, and Squidward deformed and misshapen into a liquid ball of the fused characters as the episode ends]",

        "synopsis": "The episode begins with Squidward and SpongeBob walking to work, where SpongeBob tells a false story about overcooking the fries as usual, much to Squidward's annoyance. However, when they reach their workplace, SpongeBob and Squidward are both shocked to see that the Krusty Krab has dramatically changed. Mr. Krabs comes out and reveals that he has turned the restaurant into a hotel and renamed it the Krusty Towers, with the original building now on top of a large tower. When SpongeBob asks Mr. Krabs why he's built the hotel, he explains that while he was on vacation, he had fun, but was shocked by his outrageously high hotel bills, tallying up to $345.00, and realized how much money hotels can make off of anything, including food. He also says that the employees at his hotel lived by a code: \"We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request,\" which was on a gold plaque above a fireplace in the hotel he stayed at. He puts that code in for the Krusty Towers as well. Mr. Krabs then brings SpongeBob and Squidward into the hotel and quickly makes them his new hotel employees.A customer enters and orders a Double Krabby Patty with no onions and extra pickles, but then leaves when Mr. Krabs tells him that he must book a hotel room and order room service to eat their food because the customer only has an hour for lunch. Patrick soon arrives and becomes the hotel's first actual guest, which Squidward can't help but question. Patrick tells Squidward that he sometimes just needs to \"get away from it all\". After Patrick signs the register, which he initially believed was a test he'd failed to study for, Squidward carries Patrick's bags up to his room. He tries to take the guest elevator, but Mr. Krabs stops him and explains that he must take the \"employee elevator,\" which is actually in fact, a staircase. Patrick then requests Squidward to come several more times for ridiculous reasons. Whenever Squidward gets to the bottom of the hotel, Mr. Krabs tells him to go back up to do something that Patrick wants even though he just got back, which annoys Squidward more and more. Squidward complains to Mr. Krabs about his unreasonable behavior, but Mr. Krabs refuses to do anything about it saying he has the right to be as unreasonable as he wants, citing the plaque. After being ordered to give Patrick a \"bubble bath,\" Squidward refuses, states that he has had enough, and rides the guest elevator down to the lobby where he stubbornly quits his job despite Mr. Krabs' protests.He walks out the door and immediately comes back to the hotel as a guest instead of an employee. He decides to punish Mr. Krabs by taking advantage of his code. Squidward demands a room on the top floor and that Mr. Krabs carry him to get there, which he gets both by paying him and using the plaque. He orders a Krabby Patty with cheese, nose hair, and toenail clippings, and forces Mr. Krabs to eat it for his own humor. Also, Patrick has the cheese all over his room, which is supposed to be on that Krabby Patty, because he said earlier, he wanted the room with cheese. Squidward then wants his cookies like the ones his mother makes, which Mr. Krabs resentfully has to get from Mrs. Tentacles. SpongeBob comes with him to have Squidward's mother help him make the cookies. Then after the cookies are completed to Squidward's satisfaction, he asks Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob to repaint his room and change his furniture, only to get it back to its original state after they go through several different design ideas. Squidward then asks for the pool, which Mr. Krabs tells him is out in the back of the building, to be brought inside and made into an indoor pool. After getting the indoor pool, Patrick jumps in to join Squidward and SpongeBob, but the force causes the hotel to collapse, leaving only the original Krusty Krab standing.Patrick, SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs luckily survive the destruction, but end up in the hospital with massive injuries, requiring casts and bandages to be wrapped around them. When the episode ends with Mr. Krabs outraged to see the hospital fee ($15,000), he scraps the idea of a hotel and tells Squidward, SpongeBob, and Patrick that they are going to medical school, much to the former's dismay and the latter two's delight.",

        "transcript": "[SpongeBob and Squidward are walking out of their homes and down the road towards the Krusty Krab.] SpongeBob: So, I was all ready to drain the fries, but I cooked the fries slightly too long! So... Squidward: SpongeBob? SpongeBob: So, here's where the bizarre twist comes in. Squidward: SpongeBob? SpongeBob: They weren't overcooked at all! Squidward: SpongeBob, look! [picks him up and turns him around where we are shown a tall building where the Krusty Krab usually is. On top of the building is The Krusty Krab] SpongeBob: Wow, what happened to the Krusty Krab? Mr. Krabs: Good morning! The Krusty Towers is now open for business! SpongeBob: Why did you build a hotel, Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs: I'm glad you asked, son. Remember when I went to that fast food convention and stayed in that fancy hotel? I had a beautiful room. The employees were so friendly. They catered to me every whim, no matter how demeaning it was. Because they lived by a code. And that code was engraved in fine gold above the grand fireplace: \"We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request.\" Everything was perfect... until I got the bill! They charged me for everything; $25 for a hamburger! [takes out a whole burger from inside his body] If they can charge that much for a lousy burger, imagine how much I could charge for a lousy Krabby Patty! And thus, the Krusty Towers was born. Squidward: Why would anyone stay in a hotel in Bikini Bottom? It's in the middle of scenic nowhere! There's nothing to do but get stung by jellyfish. [jellyfish stings Squidward on the head, forming a bump] See?! SpongeBob: [pushes the bump in and it goes to the other side of Squidward's head] Ooh! Mr. Krabs: Come inside. [now inside Krusty Towers] Isn't it beautiful? Squidward: Where are all the new hotel employees? [Mr. Krabs throws uniforms onto Squidward & SpongeBob. Dave enters] Mr. Krabs: My first hotel guest! Watch me reel him in. [walks behind desk] Welcome to the Krusty Towers, where our motto is \"We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request.\" Dave: Oh, that's great. I'd like a double Krabby Patty with no onions and extra pickles. Mr. Krabs: If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to rent a room and order room service. Dave: [looks at watch] Ooh, I've only got an hour for lunch. [sighs and leaves] Squidward: Boy, you reeled that one in like a pro. Mr. Krabs: Okay, Squidward, you run the front desk. [Patrick now arrives at the hotel] Patrick: I'd like a Krabby Patty, please. Squidward: This is a hotel now. If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to get a room and order room service. Patrick: Okay, one Krabby Patty and one room with cheese. Oh, and can I get cheese on the Krabby Patty, too? Squidward: Patrick, you only live 400 yards away. Why do you want to check into a hotel? Patrick: Sometimes I just need to get away from it all. [rings bell] Wow, this hotel has everything! Squidward: [takes bell] Gimme that! Now sign the register. Patrick: I didn't know there would be a test. I didn't study! [cries] Squidward: Patrick, all you have to do is write your name. Patrick: Oh, okay. [takes pen and prepares to write his name, but he finds that Squidward is watching his writing] Do you mind?! [Squidward turns around so Patrick starts writing. Squidward peeks] Don't look! [Squidward turns around] Done! [Patrick has drawn a giant monster doodle of himself fighting three attack planes.] Squidward: Close enough. Here's your room key. Patrick: I'll need some help with my bags. Squidward: How can you have bags?! You just found out this is a hotel! Patrick: This is a hotel? Squidward: [groans] SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Yes, Squidward? Squidward: Take Patrick and his bags to his room. Patrick: What about my Krabby Patty? Squidward: And bring him a Krabby Patty. Mr. Krabs: [pops up from behind the desk] Squidward, you can take Patrick's bags up to his room. SpongeBob, you go make the Krabby Patty. [he exits] Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs: What's the matter? Afraid of a little manual labor? [mocking Squidward] Ooh \"I'm Squidward and I have to work for a living. Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo.\" Squidward: Fine. Let's go, Patrick. [has struggle with Patrick's bags as he is walking up to the elevator, but it's the guest elevator] Mr. Krabs: [comes out of the guest elevator] This elevator is for guests only. Take the employee elevator. [Squidward walks to the other elevator for employees, which it turns out to be stairs. He grumbles because of this. Later, Squidward walks up stairs as Patrick gets off the guest elevator] Squidward: What's in these bags, rocks? [suitcase opens, spilling out rocks] Hey, these are rocks! Why is your suitcase full of rocks? Patrick: I don't tell you how to live your life! Squidward: [cuts to Patrick's Hotel Room] Well, here's your room. Patrick: Wow. Squidward: Enjoy your stay. Patrick: Squidward, wait! [takes out a rock from his pocket and gives it to Squidward as a tip] Keep up the good work and there'll be more where that came from. SpongeBob: Your Krabby Patty, sir. [Squidward attempting to throw the rock that Patrick gave to him as a tip] Hey, Squidward. Cool rock. Patrick: Hold on a second, SpongeBob. [hands SpongeBob a dollar, Squidward makes a surprise face, then scowls] Here you are, my good man. SpongeBob: Why, thank you, Patrick! Patrick: There's plenty more where that came from, my good friend [Squidward looks at his rock and becomes frustrated] Squidward! Squidward: What now?! Patrick: I don't like crusts on my sandwich. Squidward: It's a bun; it's all crust! How am I suppose to cut the crust off a bun? Patrick: Peel it. Squidward: [peels the skin off the bun angrily] Happy? Patrick: Yay! [eats the patty] SpongeBob: Room service! Here's the fifty Krabby Patties you ordered. Patrick: Could you do one more thing for me? Squidward: Why don't you ask SpongeBob? Patrick: Good idea, Squidward! SpongeBob: How may I serve you, sir? Patrick: I need you to eat these Krabby Patties with me. SpongeBob: Oh, yes, sir! [both of them eat a bunch of Krabby Patties. As Squidward heads down the employee elevator, Mr. Krabs is on the phone] Mr. Krabs: Uh-huh. Hold on. Squidward! Patrick needs your help. Squidward: What?! Why didn't he ask me before I walked all the way downstairs? Mr. Krabs: He said he didn't want to bother you, but he got over it. [At the bathroom, Squidward is unclogging the toilet when he unclogs SpongeBob.] Patrick: Hooray! SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward! [Squidward puts him back in the toilet of clogging again. Patrick flushes again] Squidward: Mr. Krabs, this is ridiculous! Patrick's being completely unreasonable! Mr. Krabs: He can be as unreasonable as he wants! The plaque, Squidward, the plaque! Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs...! Mr. Krabs: Deny no guest! [phone rings] Well, hello, Patrick. You need Squidward to come up right away? He'll be right there. Squidward: [scene transits to bubbles floating from a bathtub] A bubble bath?! Why would I give you a bubble bath?! Patrick: Well, because Mr. Krabs said you would. Now be sure to make my back extra shiny clean. Squidward: That's it! I've had enough! [storms out] Patrick: Squidward, wait! The toilet's backed up again! Mr. Krabs: [Squidward comes out of the guest elevator] Hey! Hey, you can't take that elevator! You're an employee! Squidward: Not anymore. I quit! [Squidward throws his uniform on Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs: Quit?! You can't quit. [Squidward walks out naked and reenters with Hawaiian-styled clothes. Squidward rings the bell] Welcome to the Krusty Towers... Squidward?! Squidward: One room, please. On the top floor. Mr. Krabs: What do you think you're doing? Squidward: I need a vacation. I'm overworked. And what better place to relax than Krusty Towers? Where \"we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request.\" Mr. Krabs: I don't have to rent you a room! Squidward: I've got cash. Mr. Krabs: Oh... [takes Squidward's cash] here's your room key. Squidward: SpongeBob, carry my things to my room. SpongeBob: Aye aye, guest sir. [turns legs into rockets and blasts off through the ceiling] Squidward: [talking to Mr. Krabs] And you can carry me to my room. Mr. Krabs: And why in tarnation would I do that? You got four legs that aren't broken. Squidward: The plaque. [plaque is shown. Mr. Krabs, in an employee uniform now, has just finished carrying Squidward from the employee elevator] Too bad we couldn't take the elevator, but it is for guests only, and you are an employee. SpongeBob: Your room, sir. Squidward: And I'd like to order room service. I'd like a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenail clippings, and nose hair. Mr. Krabs: [gasps in horror] You've got to be kidding me! Squidward: And I want it here in five seconds. SpongeBob: Yes, sir! [runs off and comes back with a Krabby Patty in less than two seconds] Here you are, sir. Mr. Krabs: Well, you got your stinky sandwich. Now eat it. Squidward: Oh, I'm not going to eat this. You are. Mr. Krabs: What?! You're out of your mind if you think I'm going to eat that! SpongeBob: Psst, [whispering] that's not really a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenails, and nose hair. Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Now I get ya, boy. [still laughing] Alright, Squidward. [chortles. He eats the Krabby Patty then spits it out, showing his tongue covered with toenails and nose hair. Squidward laughs] SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. We're all out of cheese. Patrick: [everything in Patrick's room is covered in cheese because apparently he asked for his room to be covered with cheese earlier] Hooray! Mr. Krabs: [Meanwhile, the phone rings] What is it, Squidward? Squidward: Send up a dozen cookies just like mother used to make. Mr. Krabs: [at Squidward's room] Here's your homemade cookies. Squidward: [tries one and spits it out] These don't taste anything like mom used to make! Mr. Krabs: Well, how did your mother make 'em? Squidward: How should I know? Ask my mother! [slams the door] [The scene cuts to Mrs. Tentacles' house.] Mrs. Tentacles: [Mr. Krabs rings the doorbell] Hello? [Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are in ski masks and Mrs. Tentacles gasps in shock] Mr. Krabs: [trying to get a big sack in the trunk, but the door won't close] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob hits the sack with a shovel, but the trunk still won't close] SpongeBob: No good, Mr. Krabs. Mrs. Tentacles: Allow me, boys. [closes the trunk door] Mr. Krabs: Great! Now that me laundry's in the trunk... SpongeBob: There's room for you to sit up front! Mrs. Tentacles: Let's go bake some cookies, boys! SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: Hooray! Mr. Krabs: [in Squidward's room where Squidward is sampling the cookies] Well? Squidward: I'm impressed! These are just like mother used to make. I just wish mom was a better cook. Mr. Krabs: [throws the tray away] So you're all taken care of? Squidward: Hm, just one teensy tiny problem. This room is hideous. Redesign it. Neptune the 14th would be nice. Mr. Krabs: What? [growls while Squidward says the next line] Squidward: \"We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request.\" [Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob change the room to a blue theme of King Neptune, a modern theme, a country theme, a torture theme, and then back to the original] Perfect! Mr. Krabs: This room is exactly the same as when we started! Squidward: Nothing like getting back to the basics. Mr. Krabs: Let's get out of here, SpongeBob! Squidward: Oh, before you leave, I want to go swimming. Mr. Krabs: The pool's out back. Squidward: Ha ha, are you crazy? I'm not going outside to swim. [big swimming pool is now inside the room] Come on in, the water's fine. [SpongeBob jumps in] Mr. Krabs: Anything else stupid and unreasonable that you want? Squidward: Nope, that's it. Mr. Krabs: You don't need me to chew your food for ya? Or make you a back scratcher out of me own spine? Or maybe extinguish the sun so the light don't get in your eyes?! Squidward: No, I'm good. SpongeBob: Me, too. Patrick: Wow, an indoor pool? Well, this place is fancy. [gets on diving board] Cannonball! [jumps in, but the pool collapses the hotel back into the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs: [at hospital with the gang] Oh, that hotel was a bad idea from the start. Patrick: That was a hotel? Nurse: Your bill, sir. Mr. Krabs: $15,000?! [he then acts as if he is having a heart attack] Squidward: You're not going to have a heart attack, are you? Mr. Krabs: Not at these prices! Forget hotels. This hospital racket is where the money is! Patrick: This is a hospital? Mr. Krabs: Pack your bags, boys! You're going to medical school! SpongeBob & Patrick: Hooray! Squidward: [plaintively] Oh, boy.",

        "synopsis": "At Mrs. Puff's Boating School, Mr. Fitz, the superintendent, is talking to Mrs. Puff about renewing her teaching certificate, but then informs her of the high record of failing students. However, SpongeBob is the only student who has ever failed her boating class, but has done so 1,258,056 times. Mrs. Puff is told to show Mr. Fitz everything she has taught SpongeBob, and within seconds, he fails yet another driving test by bashing into a boatmobile. Mr. Fitz fires Mrs. Puff, much to her delight of not having to deal with SpongeBob anymore. A new boating instructor named Sergeant Roderick comes in and takes over the school.Sergeant Roderick is a viciously hard-drill instructor, who immediately smashes Mrs. Puff's id card on the desk and throws out one student for talking and another one for eating. All of the other students run away, except for SpongeBob, who is now his only student. The new boating instructor has set up a difficult course, which he trains SpongeBob to crawl, walk, run, and eventually drive through while blindfolded. Despite SpongeBob's unprofessional driving skills, he surprisingly masters this.During the time of his final exam, which Mr. Fitz personally comes to watch, SpongeBob attempts to wear his blindfold for it, but Roderick finally tells him that's illegal, despite SpongeBob reminding he can't drive without a blindfold on. Roderick orders him to drive, and SpongeBob does what he's told and starts driving with the same disastrous results, destroying part of Bikini Bottom in the process. While driving thru a field, the boat picks up Mrs. Puff while she is painting. Roderick tells SpongeBob to use the brakes, but he misunderstands what he means and removes them. Roderick then jumps out of the boat and tries to stop it by jumping in front of it but is easily run over by it. After SpongeBob loses his sight due to getting Patrick's pants over his eyes, he begins to drive easily again and successfully avoids crashing into several cars and two pedestrians, then reverse parallel parks the boat. However, due to the damage he did to the city, he fails his test once again. Mr. Fitz realizes that SpongeBob is \"unteachable\" even with their best teacher and rehires Mrs. Puff.The next day, SpongeBob goes to Mrs. Puff's class and gives back her repaired id card as a \"welcome back\" gift, then proceeding to apologize for his destruction. Though Mrs. Puff tearfully tells him that she got her teaching degree back, and SpongeBob's file was destroyed in the fire, so it was as if he never failed her boating school. SpongeBob leaves, promising it will not take him a \"million times\" to pass school, leaving a devastated Mrs. Puff to cry and finishing the episode from there.",

        "transcript": "[The episode starts at Mrs. Puff's Boating School] Mr. Gunther Fitz: Morning, Mrs. Puff. I'm Mr. Fitz. I represent the 'Boating Teachers Accreditation Bureau'. As you know, your teaching certificate is up for renewal. However, we have noticed there have been an unusually large amount of failings from this classroom. Mrs. Puff: That's impossible. In all my years of teaching, only one student has failed my class. Mr. Fitz: Yes, but he's failed 1,258,056 times. [Shows folder with a bunch of files. While flipping through them, SpongeBob's picture is him laughing frame by frame while his laughter is heard] Mrs. Puff: You don't understand. SpongeBob is unteachable. Mr. Fitz: We cannot blame the students for the incompetence of the teacher. SpongeBob: Honk honk! Beep beep! I'm ready to drive. Are you ready for my driving test today, Mrs. Puff? Mr. Fitz: Okay, Mrs. Puff, if SpongeBob fails this test, you will be replaced. [Bubble transition to Mrs. Puff, SpongeBob, and Mr. Fitz in the boat.] Mrs. Puff: Okay, SpongeBob, let's demonstrate for Mr. Fitz everything I've taught you in boating school. Now, what's the first thing we do before we start boating? SpongeBob: [snaps fingers] Seat-belt-aroony. One second. [gets tangled in seat-belt then squeezes self through. Mr. Fitz writes on his notepad] Mrs. Puff: Then what do you do? SpongeBob: Start the engine? Mrs. Puff: Yes. SpongeBob: [starts the boat] What do I do now? Mrs. Puff: Drive the boat. [SpongeBob bumps into another boat] SpongeBob: Did I pass this time, Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, you failed. SpongeBob: I failed? Mr. Fitz: It's not you that failed, SpongeBob. It's Mrs. Puff that's failed you. You are relieved of your teaching duties. Mrs. Puff: I won't be teaching SpongeBob anymore? [starts laughing louder and louder] No more... SpongeBob?! I thought this day would never come. Goodbye, SpongeBob! Have a nice life. [flies away] Free at last! Free at last! SpongeBob: [in classroom] I got Mrs. Puff fired. [banging and crashing] Sergeant Sam Roderick: Hello, worthless students. I'm your new instructor. [he smashes Mrs. Puff's nameplate] No one's ever failed my class... that's lived through it. I can assure you these next 4 weeks will be the worst years of your miserable lives. Your spine will break, your teeth will ache, your eyes will be bloodshot. You will drive out of this school in style. Or you will be carted out in your granny's hand basket. Everyone will follow the rules of the class. First rule: No talking. Nat: Does that mean... [Roderick throws him through the door] Roderick: Second Rule: no eating in my class. Would anyone care for a bon-bon? [All the students, including SpongeBob, keep silent] Monroe: Uhh, I'll eat one! [all gasp. Monroe walks to Roderick] Roderick: Pick your favorite. [Monroe takes one and eats it] How's it taste? Monroe: It's a delightful taste sensation. Roderick: No eating in my classroom! [throws Monroe through another door] Now, if anyone else is man enough to stay in this class... [everyone but SpongeBob run out] Looks like you're the man, Sponge. SpongeBob: I am? Roderick: [outside] Do you wanna learn how to drive or what? SpongeBob: Yes, sir! I'm ready to drive. [jumps in the boat] Roderick: What do you think you're doing? SpongeBob: Ready for my test, sir. Roderick: [takes SpongeBob out of the boat] You're not ready to drive yet until you learn that first. [shows roads will all sorts of obstacles] This is [the] most grueling driving course ever devised. You will learn every turn, bump, and crack on it. You'll start out crawling it. SpongeBob: Crawl? [Bubble transition to SpongeBob crawling at the starting line.] Roderick: Hut, two, hut, two, hut, two, hut, two. [SpongeBob crawls forward] SpongeBob: Left turn. [turns left] Crack. Bump. Nickel. Hey a nickel! Roderick: Keep your eyes on the road, cadet. SpongeBob: Pebble! [crawls faster and more out of control. Gets the pebble stuck in his hand and goes on screaming in pain] Owww! Woooah! Aaah! Woah! [his butt gets set on fire rolls down the obstacle course then flies into the air, out of the water where Bikini Atoll is sitting, then falls back down where the instructor catches him as he screams] Aaah! Woah! Aaaahhh! [he stops screaming] Whew! [falls with only his arm taken off] Roderick: I'm ashamed of you, cadet. [removes the pebble from SpongeBob's hand] Tripped up by a wee pebble. [crushes the pebble] What are you suppose to be learning in my class? SpongeBob: How to drive, sir? Roderick: Affirmative. But before you learn to drive, you must learn to crawl . And then you learn to walk and then you learn to run. But before you learn to walk, you must learn to crawl . [bends SpongeBob's arm] I want you to crawl ! [puts SpongeBob's arm back] SpongeBob: Sir, yes, sir! Roderick: Now get out there! [SpongeBob crawls around a hole then his instructor takes off his shoes and socks except the ripped top parts of his socks; he wiggles his toes after his shoes are forcibly taken off, and carries the instructor on his back barefooted. Then he stops at a stop sign, and runs in and out of some radioactive waste] Every good boater needs to know his vehicle inside and out. [hands SpongeBob a wrench] Here, go take that boat apart. [SpongeBob takes the boat apart] I'm impressed, son. Put it back together again! SpongeBob: [laughs] That'll be easy. Roderick: Are you sure? SpongeBob: Um, yeah. You just put the jigamahoo on the doohickey and uhh... [laughs] I might need a couple minutes. [later, the instructor is sleeping] It's ready, sarge! [SpongeBob has re-assembled the boat into a rocket ship] Roderick: [wakes up] Jumpin' jellyfish... [the rocket blasts off] SpongeBob: Watch for pedestrians. Check mirrors. Observe that speed limit. Watch for pedestrians! [crashes through a lot of pedestrians as he screams and he gets out of control] So, umm, how'd I do? Roderick: How'd you do? Why don't you ask the shattered remains of this pedestrian... [yelling] how you did!? SpongeBob: Now I know this forwards, backwards, and sideways. Am I ready to get behind the wheel? Roderick: Not quite. [puts blindfold on SpongeBob] Now do it blindfolded. [SpongeBob crashes through another pedestrian off-screen.] French Narrator: Several days later... SpongeBob: 1003, 1004, 1005. [stops] Ooh, pebble #143. [steps over pebble] Ha, you will not trip me up again, pebble #143! 1006, 1007, 1008. [old lady pedestrian pops up with a ham sandwich] Old lady with a ham sandwich. 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012. Roderick: Congratulations. You're ready to get behind the wheel. SpongeBob: Really? I'm ready! I'm ready. I'm... [runs into a pole] Roderick: [now in boat] Let's see what I taught you, laddy. SpongeBob: Yes, sir! [drives boat] Left turn at pebble #143. Kid with a ball. [SpongeBob continues] Nice boy. Roderick: Nice driving. Now parallel park up ahead. [SpongeBob parallel parks] Very good. [now at real exam] Now, boy, the time has come to show Mr. Fits what you've learn. SpongeBob: Yes, sir! Step 1: seatbelts. [puts on seatbelt with no problem] Roderick: Excellent work, cadet. What's next? SpongeBob: Step 2 would be... ignite engine. Roderick: Step 3? SpongeBob: Step 3 would be... [takes out blindfold and his eyes shrink] ...engage blindfold. Roderick: What? You can't drive a boat with a blindfold on. That's illegal. SpongeBob: But I can't do it without a blindfold. Roderick: Drive, boy! Drive! [SpongeBob kicks down on the gas pedal and the boat is off. At the first turn is a giant red canister labeled \"GAS.\" SpongeBob fails to make the right turn and instead crashes right into the gas can, obliterating the boating school faculty in a mushroom-radius explosion, and sending debris from the boating school sign, etc., flying everywhere. As the debris begins to clear, the boat flies into the air and goes soaring.] Roderick: Mayday! Mayday! You're off course. [boat drives into 2 buildings then underground. Spurts out from a fire hydrant. Then crashes through a bakery and into a field where Mrs. Puff is painting the scenery] Mrs. Puff: Ah, I feel so serene now that I'm away from that homicidal maniac, SpongeBob. [Mrs. Puff notices the boat and attempts to paint something really quick. When boat runs into her, the painting shows SpongeBob, the instructor, and Mr. Fitz fearing their lives] Roderick: The brake son! SpongeBob: Aye aye, sir. [takes brake apart] There you go, sir. All I had to do was unscrew two of the bolts. Roderick: I'm gonna stop this thing. Tell my wife I love her. [jumps in front of the boat in an attempt to stop it] Come get some! [boat runs over him] SpongeBob: Man down. Man down. [SpongeBob drives into the city and into each building] Sorry, excuse me. Sorry. Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I can't stop the boat right now. [boat drives out of the now destroyed city, and then cuts to SpongeBob driving while wearing Patrick's pants over his eyes] I can't see! I can't see! Patrick: My pants! SpongeBob: Hey, I can't see! [dodges traffic and pedestrians as Mrs. Puff screams. Parallel parks] Did I pass? Mr. Fitz: Well, if there was a 'destroy the city' part of the test, you would have. Patrick: [takes his pants off SpongeBob's head and puts it back on] The nerve of some people. Mr. Fitz: Sorry, SpongeBob, you failed again. Even our finest instructor could not teach you. Mrs. Puff, you're hired again. SpongeBob: [at boating school] Hey, Mrs. Puff! Sorry I'm \"unteachable.\" Mrs. Puff: It's okay. Mr. Fitz gave me my teaching certificate back. [sniffles, holds up a burnt, charred object] And your dossier was destroyed in the explosion, [voice breaking] so it's as if you never failed. SpongeBob: I got you a welcome back gift, Mrs. Puff. [shows name tag] I found all the pieces and glued them back together. I promise it won't take me a million tries this time. [Mrs. Puff puts her head down on her desk and begins to sob quietly, and the name tag shatters as the episode ends.]",

        "synopsis": "The narrator opens the episode by stating \"It is a very special day in Bikini Bottom.\" The camera then shows SpongeBob and Patrick heading down to Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Once they arrive at the entrance, Patrick says he brought SpongeBob's special learning cards that has everything he needs to pass the boating school test. However, Patrick then eats the cards and claims learning tastes good. Even though SpongeBob needed those learning cards, Patrick convinces SpongeBob that he is a winner and does not need them. SpongeBob then claims he is a winner and takes his boating school driving test.Unfortunately, after one minute and thirty-seven seconds, SpongeBob fails the driving test for the 58th time. Patrick, thinking the test is rigged, decides to take the test himself and passes with a perfect score on the first try, much to SpongeBob's surprise and jealousy. They go to receive Patrick's license, but while his picture is being taken, an announcer comes out to reveal that since he is the one millionth person to pass the test, he has won a brand new hot red boatmobile, the new Bass Blaster 3000.SpongeBob and Patrick drive home in Patrick's new boatmobile while Patrick talks about how fun driving is, much to SpongeBob's disappointment. That night, Patrick is heard working on his boatmobile and comes to SpongeBob's door at 4 AM to show his new license. SpongeBob tries to get some sleep, but is woken up the next minute by his alarm clock.SpongeBob, now very tired, tries to walk to work, but, unable to walk because of his tiredness, he eventually gets a ride from Patrick, who rubs his license in SpongeBob's face and brags even more. When SpongeBob gets to work, he tries to talk himself out of riding with Patrick, but finds out that Mr. Krabs has chosen him to run the Krusty Krab's new drive-thru. He meets Patrick and his boat again.At closing time, Patrick drives up, now wearing a racing outfit, claiming that he must keep up his image as an \"expert driver.\" While driving around, Patrick rubs his license in SpongeBob's face even more, even stopping to talk to SpongeBob's parents about it and embarrass SpongeBob. Patrick then starts driving slightly above the speed limit, which prompts SpongeBob to try and get him in trouble for speeding, but he fails since he tells Patrick to stop and a police officer tells him he's going far under the limit. Patrick then runs three red lights, and makes an offscreen illegal U-turn through an orphanage.Furious, SpongeBob finally snaps after Patrick calls himself a \"driving genius,\" admitting his jealousy toward him and this would have been his boat if he passed. Patrick calls out SpongeBob for his jealousy and that he should be happy for him getting his license, but SpongeBob chews his friend back for rubbing his license in his face. Patrick denies this accusation and literally shoves his license between SpongeBob's eyes. In a final fit of fury, an enraged SpongeBob tears up the license and throws it out the window, much to Patrick's despair. This gets the attention of the police officer from earlier and causes a whole squad of cop cars to chase after SpongeBob and Patrick. When the police yell for Patrick to pull over, he instead begins driving out of control, not knowing what to do since he no longer has his license, and eventually drives off of a cliff into the Bikini Bottom Jail yard with the police following after him.Patrick is put on trial and found guilty of littering. The judge gives him 90 days in jail to hold him accountable. However, a remorseful SpongeBob admits the truth and gets the 90 day jail sentence in Patrick's place. When SpongeBob is happily released, he gives a delighted Patrick a new license plate for his boatmobile, but Patrick reveals that he threw out the boatmobile because it stopped working when it got to \"e\" which he thought meant \"end,\" which really meant \"empty\" as in out of gas. As the episode concludes, SpongeBob and Patrick pretend to play boats with SpongeBob putting the license on Patrick's butt and riding him away.",

Patrick, did you bring my flashcards? Patrick: Right here, buddy. [takes them out of his pocket] Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards. [eats the cards] Mmm. SpongeBob: No, Patrick! Patrick: Hey, learning tastes good. SpongeBob: Patrick, I needed those. Patrick: Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone. SpongeBob: 57 times. Patrick: Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner. SpongeBob: I'm a winner? Patrick: Who's a winner? SpongeBob: [sadly] I'm a winner. Patrick: Who's a winner? SpongeBob: [cheered up a little] I'm a winner. Patrick: Who's a winner?! SpongeBob: I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner! [runs into the classroom] French Narrator: One minute thirty seven seconds later... [SpongeBob walks up crying] Patrick: How'd you do, winner? [SpongeBob's crying continues] Let's see that license. SpongeBob: I didn't get a license, Patrick. Patrick: Are they gonna mail it to you? SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all. Patrick: No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged. SpongeBob: Let's just go home, Patrick. Patrick: We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself. SpongeBob: [hanging onto Patrick's pants] No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive. [Patrick's pants rip off] Patrick: Please, SpongeBob. I think I know what I'm doing. SpongeBob: No, Patrick. No! Mrs. Puff: [Patrick walks up to the boat she is sitting in and gets in it, in his underwear] Good morning. Patrick: You're not the judge of me! Mrs. Puff: Actually, I am. Let the testing begin! [clicks her pen. Scene cuts to SpongeBob, outside the boating school] SpongeBob: I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I? Patrick: SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob: I'm here for you, buddy. Patrick: I passed my test! SpongeBob: You got a perfect score? Patrick: Yeah, I thought you said it was hard. SpongeBob: Perfect score. [eye twitches] Patrick: Come on, I'm gonna get my picture taken for my new license. [scene cuts to the license registration building] Miss Shell: Stand behind the line, sir. Patrick: [smiling] How do I look? SpongeBob: [sarcastically] Like a winner. Miss Shell: Ready? Patrick: Ready. [banner comes down which says \"CONGRATULATIONS\" on it. Balloons and confetti fall] SpongeBob: Huh? Fish: Congratulations, Mr. Star. You're the one millionth person to pass the test. Patrick: Does that mean I get a free key chain? Fish: Uhh, no. Patrick: Oh. Fish: You get a brand-new boat mobile. The new Bass Blaster 3000. The ultimate boating machine. [Patrick runs up to the new boatmobile as SpongeBob's jaw drops] Patrick: Yeah! All right! Fish: Women will want you. [all sigh] Men will want to be you. [all faint] You'll be the envy of your friends. [SpongeBob growling in fury] Patrick: Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat. SpongeBob: I'm so happy for you... [\"La Cucaracha\" horn blows in his face] Whoa! Patrick: The horn works. [scene cuts to Patrick driving his new boat down the road] Woo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license. Patrick: Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license. SpongeBob: Two millionth? Patrick: Then you can get a free boat just like me. SpongeBob: Yeah, just like you. Patrick: I try to serve as an inspiration to others. SpongeBob: Can we go home now? [zoom out and scene shows Patrick driving around his rock over and over] We've been driving around your house for hours. Patrick: I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it? SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride, Patrick. Patrick: No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian. [shudders then drives off. SpongeBob imitates Patrick. Scene cuts to SpongeBob in bed asleep. His clock turns to 3:00am when an engine revving is heard which sends SpongeBob into his diving board then back into his bed] SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing? Patrick: I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep. [SpongeBob groans and slams his window shut, breaking it, before going back to bed. Scene cuts to 4:00am] SpongeBob: 4:00? [yawns. Doorbell rings] Who could be at the door at this hou— [falls down the stairs. Opens the door] Now what is it, Patrick? Patrick: You will never guess what happen to me today. SpongeBob: You got your license. Patrick: Yeah! [shows his license] But that's not all. SpongeBob: You got a new boat. Patrick: Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life. [walks off] SpongeBob: [gets back into bed] Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep. [foghorn alarm blows] Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat. [scene cuts to morning where SpongeBob is leaving home to go to work] I'm so tired. [horn honks] Patrick: Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work? SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work. [tries to take a step, but falls down in the process. Scene cuts to Patrick driving SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab] Patrick: Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license. SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride. Patrick: No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license. [SpongeBob is getting extremely enraged] SpongeBob: That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile... Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru. SpongeBob: When did we get a drive-thru? Mr. Krabs: I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams. SpongeBob: I used to have a dream. Mr. Krabs: Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living. SpongeBob: [through headphones] Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I— [\"La Cucaracha\" horn honks] Patrick: The horn still works. [scene cuts to SpongeBob switching the OPEN sign to CLOSED then walking out of work. Patrick drives up in a racing uniform] Hey, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: What's with the helmet, Patrick? Patrick: Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image. [clicks tongue] SpongeBob: Uh-huh. [scene cuts to Patrick driving] Patrick: Boy, driving is so easy. SpongeBob: Oh? Patrick: Do you want me to give you lessons? SpongeBob: [sarcastic] Oh, that would be great. Patrick: Oh! [drives over to SpongeBob's parents] SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick: Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy. Mr. SquarePants: Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you? We're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours. Patrick: What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test. Mrs. SquarePants: That's great, Patrick. Patrick: SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it. Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield. SpongeBob: Mom! Patrick: Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides. SpongeBob: Hey! [Patrick drives off] Mr. SquarePants: Even Patrick has a license. [both parents sigh] Patrick: Let's see what this baby can do. [steps on the gas. Ride pass a sign that reads 'SPEED LIMIT 40 MPH'] SpongeBob: Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph. Patrick: Yeah, yeah. SpongeBob: [reads the speedometer] 40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car. [car stops next to a policeman] Patrick: What? Where? Who? SpongeBob: Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun? Officer: Umm... okay. [uses radar gun. It reads 0mph] Actually, he's going 40mph under the limit. So, move along before I run you in, tattletale. [drives off] SpongeBob: Are you sure you don't want to run him in? [scene cuts to Patrick driving. Green light turns red] It's a red light, Patrick! [Patrick runs through three red lights] Patrick, you just ran three red lights! Patrick: So? SpongeBob: You're suppose to stop! Patrick: I think the driving genius knows what he's doing. SpongeBob: [finally snaps] Driving genius?! Would a genius make an illegal u-turn...through an orphanage?! Patrick: They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about? SpongeBob: I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile! Patrick: How can you say that? If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license! SpongeBob: If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face! Patrick: I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face! [takes out license and rubs it in SpongeBob's face--literally--which makes muffled noises] SpongeBob: [fixes his face and then furiously snatches Patrick's license out of his hand] Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this! [furiously tears up Patrick's license then laughs maniacally. The pieces of the license fly into the cop's hands.] Officer: Huh, litterbugs. This is why I joined the force. [drives off after SpongeBob & Patrick] SpongeBob & Patrick: It's the police! Officer: [over speaker] Pull it over, litterbug! Patrick: Litterbug?! No! [drives faster] Officer: Ooh, I got me a runner. [a bunch of police cars are following him] SpongeBob: Patrick, what do you think you're doing? Patrick: I don't know! I don't have a license anymore. [drives around cards, through a sign then off a cliff into the front lot of the Bikini Bottom Jail. Scene cuts to courtroom] Judge: 90 days. I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering. Patrick: So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. [a security guard takes him away, but he ducks his head back in] Sometimes you forget to feed him. [ducks out of the shot] SpongeBob: What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait! [runs up to the judge] Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead. Judge: Well, considering there's no legal precedent... oh, what the heck. 90 days! [a smiling SpongeBob is put in jail] French Narrator: One debt to society later... [After SpongeBob's 90 day sentence, shows the jail as the door buzzes. SpongeBob is let go out of jail where Patrick is waiting for him; the two silently stare at each other smiling for about ten seconds as an orchestra swells dramatically.] SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick: SpongeBob! [both hug] SpongeBob: I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever. [shows him a license plate that reads \"PALS 4 EVER\"] Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy. Patrick: Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore. SpongeBob: What? Patrick: It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E, and I figured that must mean \"end\". SpongeBob: Oh, then... what do we do with this? [Patrick takes it and puts it on his behind] Patrick: How's that? SpongeBob: Yeah! Patrick: Ready, buddy? SpongeBob: Ready, pal. [hops on Patrick's shoulders and makes car noises] Woo! Woo!",

        "synopsis": "SpongeBob starts the episode by waking up and singing the song \"Best Day Ever,\" and he describes to Gary what he plans to do on this day: do his \"perfect\" job at the Krusty Krab, practice karate with Sandy, go jellyfishing with Patrick using his new high-tech net, and at the end of the day, attend Squidward's big clarinet recital. However, SpongeBob's \"Best Day Ever\" does not turn out as he plans. He goes to the Krusty Krab, only to find it condemned due to a severe nematode infestation. He then tells the nematodes to leave, but they eat his pants instead. SpongeBob begins playing the \"Best Day Ever\" song with his nose, causing the nematodes to follow him. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to keep playing and lead them as far away as possible, and he does so until they all fall asleep (including SpongeBob).He then goes to Sandy's Treedome for karate, but Sandy is busy trying to fix a leak in the roof of her Treedome. SpongeBob thinks that this is a trap, and attacks her anyway. Sandy hits him and sends him flying up to the roof, and his glove sticks to it, sealing the leak. Afterwards, SpongeBob heads over to Jellyfish Fields to go jellyfishing with Patrick, but Patrick explains that he has broken his net. SpongeBob gives him his old net to use, but he quickly breaks it as well. Finally, SpongeBob gives Patrick his brand-new net and sits there watching as Patrick has fun jellyfishing with it.Finally, when SpongeBob goes to Squidward's clarinet recital, Squidward tells him that he cannot play in the concert because his clarinet reed is shot. SpongeBob pulls out one of his teeth to replace the reed, and angrily demands Squidward to put on the show, frustrated that the majority of his \"Best Day Ever\" is ruined. When SpongeBob tries to enter the concert, the doorman will not let him in because he does not have a ticket. He tries various methods of sneaking in, but is caught every time. Eventually, the doorman realizes who SpongeBob is (Mrs. Puff said his name while hiding in her purse), and lets him in because he is on the VIP list. However, the concert ends just as SpongeBob gets into his seat, and then he finally loses it.Reaching his breaking point, SpongeBob goes up on stage, rips the curtains and starts furiously whining to the audience about how his \"Best Day Ever\" was completely ruined. However, his friends go up and remind SpongeBob of how he helped them with their problems out of his kindness, and to make everything up to him, his friends help turn the tables, which makes SpongeBob smile. They hold a \"very expensive\" production in which SpongeBob performs his song, \"Best Day Ever,\" to complete his real Best Day Ever with his friends by his side. After hours, SpongeBob is still singing, his friends are tired and sleepy, the audience has left the concert hall, and the janitor is sweeping the floor. As the episode ends with Squidward asking, \"How long do we have to keep this up?,\" Mr. Krabs replies with \"Just 'til his little heart gives out, Squidward. Just 'til his little heart gives out.\"",

The sun quickly rises outside, turning night into day, and SpongeBob awakens as well.] SpongeBob: ♪Mr. Sun came up, and he smiled at me. [Mr. Sun dances for a bit, then approaches SpongeBob's window, heating up the latter's bedroom in the process.] Said, [with him voicing Mr. Sun] \"It's gonna be a good one, just wait and see.\" [after a few seconds, the bed catches fire, and SpongeBob flies off of it] Jumped out of bed and I ran outside, [he now exits his house and runs around it, then on the facade of the building] feeling so extra ecstatified. It's the best day ever!♪ Echo: ♪Best day ever♪ [SpongeBob now hops on the roof where Gary is standing] SpongeBob: Hey, Gary! Gary: Meow? SpongeBob: \"Why is this the best day ever?\", you ask? Because, Gary, I get to start this wonderful day bringing life to a whole new generation [a thought cloud appears showing the visuals of SpongeBob's description of his perfect day] of delicious Krabby Patties, followed by a vigorous mid-day session of karate with Sandy, and an afternoon jellyfishing with Patrick, where I'll unveil my newest, most prized possession: the Deluxe Jelly Slayer Composite Pro! [catches Gary with the net, with the snail upside down] And for the grand finale, every one of my closest friends joining together for Squidward's clarinet recital! [the thought cloud disappears] I am so excited, I think I'm gonna explode! [He explodes into pieces then walks out of his house in one piece and continues singing while Gary went away] ♪It's the best day ever♪ Echo: ♪Best day ever♪ SpongeBob: ♪It's the best day ever♪ [SpongeBob now hops on the heads of jellyfish and stands on one of them] Echo: ♪Best day ever♪ [The jellyfish form a heart which is illuminated by their electricity] SpongeBob: ♪It's the best day ever♪ [SpongeBob leaps off of one of the jellyfish and approaches the Krusty Krab, which is wrapped completely with yellow tape] Echo: ♪Best day ever♪ SpongeBob: ♪It's the best day ever♪ Echo: ♪Best day ever♪ [SpongeBob laughs then tries opening the door to the Krusty Krab but can't because it's locked] Mr. Krabs: Get out of the way, boy! [SpongeBob flies off the door and bounces into Mr. Krabs] Me building's been condemned, boy! We got ourselves a nematode infestation! [Nematodes come and eat the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs faints] SpongeBob: But... the best day ever starts at the Krusty Krab! Guys, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave! [nematodes eat his pants] Ohhhh! Guys, you're ruining the [off-key] best day... [clears throat] Wait, no. [off-key] Best day... uhm. [plays his nose as a flute. The nematodes line up. When SpongeBob stops, the nematodes walk up] Huh? [plays the 'best day ever' tune. The nematodes chatter excitedly. They follow SpongeBob] Mr. Krabs: [sighs] Keep playing, lad! Take them devil's sons of the sea away from me restaurant! [Bubble transition. SpongeBob stops playing and falls over due to being tired. The nematodes fall asleep, also. SpongeBob's watch beeps] SpongeBob: Whoa! I gotta get to Sandy's! [scene cuts to Sandy's treedome. SpongeBob opens up her door then jumps behind a bush] Wait ‘til Sandy gets a load of these adhesive karate gloves. Hyah! [karate chops the box the gloves were in. Then he chuckles and jumps onto the top of the treedome and sticks due to his gloves. He moves above her tree and falls through it and lands on a tree branch, then jumps at her] Hyah! [Sandy ducks and SpongeBob hits her buckets of water] Sandy: [standing on a ladder, using a bucket to catch water in] SpongeBob, what on Earth are you doing?! SpongeBob: Oh, just a little something I like to call karate! Sandy: I can't right now, SpongeBob. I got a leak in my roof the size of a full-grown quarter horse! SpongeBob: Mm-hmm. I see. Okay, then. I'll come back later. [walks off, but then reappears by Sandy and tries to karate chop her] Sandy: Knock... it... off! [punches SpongeBob up high. The leak stops] It stopped? SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Yeah? Sandy: Hang on! I'm going to get some sealant and patch and trowel! [runs into her treedome] SpongeBob: [groans] Oh. [slips out of his glove and falls. Scene cuts to SpongeBob walking to Jellyfish Fields] Oh, no Krabby Patties, no karate. But at least I still have jellyfishing with... Hey, there he is now! [sees Patrick chasing a jellyfish] Wait for me, Patrick. I've got a brand-new... [Patrick is crying] What's wrong, Patrick? Patrick: I broke my net! [sobbing] SpongeBob: Well, lucky for you, I brought my old net. [Patrick grabs it] Patrick: For me? [giggles] SpongeBob: Yeah, I won't be needing it now that I got my brand-new... [Patrick breaks SpongeBob's jellyfish net. He cries] Patrick: [bawling] SpongeBob! I broke... could I use this one? [points to SpongeBob's new net] SpongeBob: Well, actually, Patrick, that's my brand-new net. Patrick: Yeah? [cut to later where SpongeBob is waiting for his net while Patrick uses it] SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, it's my turn, now. [Patrick ignores him] Hey, Patrick? Pat, old buddy. P-Patrick? It's-it's my turn now. [sighs] I guess I'll see you at the concert. [cut to SpongeBob walking at night to the concert, sadly] It's the best day ever. It's the best day ever. Oh, this best day ever isn't going so good. [takes out notebook and pencil and cancels \"Jellyfishing w/ Patrick\"] No work, no karate, no jellyfishing. Hey, I still have Squidward's concert! I won't let this one slip through my fingers. [cut to Squidward bawling outside the Bikini Bottom Recreation Center, in his uniform] Hey, Squidward. Squidward, what's wrong? Squidward: The concert is ruined! My reed is shot. [shows it] See? I'm finished! SpongeBob: [slaps Squidward] Pull yourself together, man! I came for here a concert, and darn it, I am gonna get one! Squidward: [sobbing] But my reed! [SpongeBob pulls one of his front teeth out and uses it as a reed] SpongeBob: Now play! Squidward: But... [SpongeBob slaps him] SpongeBob: I said play! [Squidward plays] Squidward: Not bad. [SpongeBob slaps him again] SpongeBob: Now get in there and give me a concert to remember! [suddenly, an usher grabs him] Usher: Where do you think you're going, kid? SpongeBob: I'm going to see Squidward play his clarinet. Today's my best day ever! Usher: Where's your ticket? SpongeBob: One ticket, coming right up, cap'n! [searches his pocket] Must be here somewhere. [takes off his pants and dumps out what is in it] I don't have a ticket. Usher: No ticket, no entry. SpongeBob: But... Usher: No ticket, no entry! [cut to a SpongeBob puppet on strings coming down] SpongeBob Puppet: Oh, dear! I don't have a ticket. But I want to go to the show. Hmmm... what should I do? Oh, I know. I'll just sneak in the back door. [leaves] Usher: Oh, no, you don't! [runs after him as SpongeBob climbs down the wall, laughing] SpongeBob: SpongeBob, you are so... [walks backwards into an usher puppet] Usher Puppet: Ticket, please. [Later, SpongeBob, wearing a ski mask, is climbing up the side of the building and through the vent on the roof. He uses a flamethrower to cut his way through a door, which is actually the entry doors. The usher kicks him away from the building. Cut to later, where Mrs. Puff drives up in her boat and gets out, walking up to the usher] Usher: Ticket, ma'am. Mrs. Puff: Certainly. [reaches into her purse. She hears some giggling and takes out the object in her purse] SpongeBob? Usher: You? This time, I'm gonna -- Wait a minute! Did you say, \"SpongeBob\"? [looks at his clipboard] SpongeBob SquarePants? You're on the VIP list! [the usher carries SpongeBob on a pillow to his seat] SpongeBob: [gasps] A reserved seat? Next to my friends? I made it! All I have to do is sit down and... [Just when he sits down, everyone applauds as the curtains close, marking the end of the show, and SpongeBob completely loses it. Yells in frustration shaking his fists up making a rumbling sound as everyone looks at him in confusion] [enraged] No! [jumps on stage and tears the curtain] No, it is not over! Everyone: Huh? SpongeBob: This was supposed to be my perfect day. But then everything... [a fish gets up and starts to leave, but SpongeBob stops him as he screams] Sit down! [the fish does so] Then everything turned to doo-doo. [Mr. Krabs, Patrick and Sandy go upstage with him] Mr. Krabs: It's okay, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: No, it's not okay! [his yelling makes Mr. Krabs and Patrick flinch and scared] This was gonna be my best day ever! Starting with doing the best job in the world: working at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs: Boy, you saved me barnacle the way you put the run on them nematodes. SpongeBob: [sniffles] Yeah, I guess so. But then I was gonna do karate with Sandy. Sandy: I know, but you saved the treedome! Pretty cool, if you ask me. SpongeBob: Well, I suppose. But then I was gonna go jellyfishing with Patrick. Patrick: But then you... Uh, what'd you do again? Squidward: And, I hate to admit it, but I suppose if you hadn't fixed my reed, the concert would have been a bust. Mr. Krabs: You see, SpongeBob, it's not about you or your perfect day or any of those things. SpongeBob: [starting to feel calm; realizing] It's not? Mr. Krabs: No. [chuckles] It's about us! SpongeBob: It is? Mr. Krabs: Yep. And since you did such a good job, we wanna make it up to you. SpongeBob: You do? Mr. Krabs: So, just tell us anything your little heart desires, and it's yours. [SpongeBob smiles and scene cuts to Mr. Krabs coming on stage with the light shining on him] Ladies and gentlemen, tonight, the Bikini Bottom Players proudly present a very expensive production of... \"The Best Day Ever!\" And it better be good for all it's costing me. The crowd applauds and the show begins; SpongeBob starts at a makeshift Krusty Krab grill.] SpongeBob: ♪My perfect job starts my perfect day.♪ [flips a patty] ♪Then it's time to kick back, relax and play.♪ [practices karate with Sandy. She kicks him. He land next to Patrick. Jellyfishes comes up in the scene] Mr. Krabs: That wasn't in the budget! SpongeBob: ♪Sing along. Hear that happy sound♪ Patrick: ♪Don't let those sour notes bring you down.♪ Squidward: Hey! SpongeBob: ♪That's where it's at!♪ [crashes spotlight] Mr. Krabs: I'm not paying for that! [As the main \"Best Day Ever\" song starts up again, three shots of spotlights are shown as they illuminate a large Krabby Patty prop. One by one, Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Patrick, and Sandy take their seats on it. Now, SpongeBob brings it home with him singing the song! Behind him, the sign reading \"Best Day Ever\" and a set of risers is on stage.] SpongeBob: ♪It's the best day ever♪ [14 SpongeBob clones appear on the risers singing and dancing as well] Echo: ♪Best day ever♪ [the real SpongeBob now runs on stage to join his friends on the Krabby Patty] SpongeBob: ♪It's the best day ever♪ Echo: ♪Best day ever♪ [The Krabby Patty rises with everyone on it and the ladder drops. The Patty now stops below the sign and it swings from side to side. Bubbles and confetti descend as the quintet continue singing and wave to the cheering audience.] SpongeBob: ♪It's the best day ever♪ Echo: ♪Best day ever♪ [moments after the show, everyone on stage is tired except SpongeBob who is still singing about] SpongeBob: ♪It's the best day ever♪ Echo: ♪Best day ever♪ Squidward: How long do we have to keep this up? Mr. Krabs: Just till his little heart gives out, Squidward. [the usher sweeps up the auditorium] Just till his little heart gives out.",

        "synopsis": "This episode is a boating video put together by Mrs. Puff and sponsored by C.O.B.B.U.T.K.S.B.S.P.O.T.R.A.O.O.B.A.T.: (Citizens of Bikini Bottom United to Keep SpongeBob SquarePants Off the Road and Out of Boats All Together). As the episode begins, Mrs. Puff first introduces herself and discusses the good and bad drivers (Squidward is the one with the Boat Smarts, and SpongeBob is the one without it).A driver with boat smarts fills their tire up to the appropriate level, but a driver without boat smarts pays no attention to how much air they are using. Squidward fills it up to the exact measurement, while SpongeBob pumps it up too much, making the boat tip over, crushing half of Squidward's boat and having the wheel pop right in front of his face.The next section is about buckling up. This shows Squidward in a boat mobile with his seatbelt in the proper manner. He then starts driving until he sees a Bikini Bottom Traffic light and he stops. Once Squidward stops, we see SpongeBob crazily speeding around a corner with no regard for safety and probably with no seatbelt on. He hits Squidward, and when he is unable to remove his seatbelt, goes flying into a spiked steamroller and gets severely hurt.In the next scene, it shows Squidward adjusting his mirrors before he begins to start the boat. Squidward starts the boat and begins to drive. SpongeBob adjusts his mirror dangerously while turning the steering wheel with one leg. He hits many fish, although he does not know because he is focusing on the mirror. He then swerves right in front of Squidward. SpongeBob adjusts the other mirror and hits Squidward with a beam of light and he is almost blinded until he puts on sunglasses. But Squidward did not see a wall and crashes into it. It shows a crash dummy, although instead of the head it shows Squidward's.Mrs. Puff is in Squidward's boat talking about not drinking or eating while driving. Squidward is driving well, as usual. Mrs. Puff explains how Squidward's eyes are locked firmly on the road. SpongeBob is then shown swerving while eating a Krabby Patty and reading a magazine. When some fish are behind him, he turns around and says: \"Hi there!\" causing them to crash. Eventually, there is a huge stockpile of cars and the owners are furious at the yellow sea sponge. SpongeBob still speeds past, runs over a puddle and slides around saying: \"Wheeeeeee!\" SpongeBob then says hi to Mrs. Puff and Squidward when SpongeBob's boat slips on a mini pebble, strangely making his boat act as a ramp in which Squidward's boat travel over. They fly into the big stockpile of all the cars and it makes a huge crash. Mrs. Puff blows up very fast and SpongeBob drives past saying: \"Looks like you guys forgot your Boat Smarts!,\" he smiles and drives off, and Mrs. Puff and Squidward are not amused, making dust and the low-quality videotape recorder stops with a frustrated Mrs. Puff saying: \"Never mind,\" as the episode abruptly ends.",

I'm Mrs. Puff, state accredited boating instructor. Today, we'll be discussing the differences between a driver with boat smarts... [cut to Squidward in a pilot uniform] Squidward: Ripping good day for a spot of driving. Mrs. Puff: ...and a driver without boat smarts. [cut to SpongeBob sliding in on his head upside down, next to Squidward] SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Look at what I can do with my feet! [wiggles his legs. Squidward gets angry] Mrs. Puff: Let's see some examples, shall we? Tire Pressure. [cut to Squidward putting air in his tires] Before you can even think about boating, the boater who uses boat smarts always fills his tires to the appropriate level. [cut to SpongeBob pumping too much air in his tires] While this driver pays no need to boat smarts. [tires flips the boat over. Then the tire explodes and blows air into Squidward's face] Buckling Up. [cut to Squidward putting on safety belt] As demonstrated by this driver, he has enough boat smarts to use his seat belt and avoid a serious casualty as a result of a collision. [drives off but stops slowly at a stop light] Notice how he comes gently to a stop sign. [cut to SpongeBob driving his boat through town destructively without wearing his seat belt and laughing] Now this driver, with no regard for safety. [Squidward screams as SpongeBob slams into the backend of Squidward's boat, sending him flying into the air still in his seat and buckled up with the steering wheel in his hand. Squidward screams more as he sees a spiky steamroller driving on the road he is flying into. He tries to get his seat belt off but squeezes through the spikes anyways] Well, at least he had his seat belt on. [the boat, now cut in half, comes out of the steamroller and in it is Squidward, all injured. His seat belt pops off] Adjusting Your Mirrors. What's our boat smarts boater up to now? [Squidward is adjusting his mirrors] You guessed it. He's adjusting his mirror before he begins boating, unlike this degenerate boater. [a beeping sound is heard. SpongeBob is running over citizens while he is adjusting his mirrors] SpongeBob: Ah, perfect. [moves from behind Squidward in the road and drives in front of him] Squidward: Hey, use your mirrors, fool! SpongeBob: Mirrors? Oh, that reminds me. I haven't adjusted this one yet. [adjusts it to where the light in the reflection blinds Squidward] Squidward: Ah! Can't see! D'oh! [puts on sunglasses and giggles. Screams as he crashes into a brick wall. Footage from live-action Japanese Crash test dummy is showing with Squidward's head replacing the Japanese dummy's head. He slides out of his seat] Ow. Mrs. Puff: Finally, and most importantly, a driver with boat smarts always pays attention to his surroundings and avoids distractions. Notice how this driver's eyes are locked firmly on the road. [Squidward's eyes turn into a lock but vision the road as well. Cut to SpongeBob eating a Krabby Patty and reading the newspaper while driving] And here we have the epitome of a driver who is carelessly distracting himself from the road and safety. [SpongeBob is shaving himself while driving the wrong way on a one way street. Tom is shaking his fist, Norma looks at SpongeBob and Fred shaking his fist in the air. He causes a woman to crash into a streetlight pole] Norma: [screams] Jerk! SpongeBob: Hi there! Nat: Help! Lunatic driver! [crashes his boat into SpongeBob's but SpongeBob's boat is unharmed and keeps driving.] SpongeBob: How's it going? [causes many drivers to flip their boats over and get in accidents] Fish: [all screaming furiously and talking at once] I can't feel my hair. My leg! Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I mean, a boater without boat smarts shows contempt for his boater brethren and the law. [SpongeBob's boat slips in some water and spins around and around] SpongeBob: Lalalalalalalalala! Whee! [his boat is driving backwards now] Hi, Squidward. Hi, Mrs. Puff. [Squidward and Mrs. Puff scream. SpongeBob's boat stops on a rock and tilts upward, causing Squidward's boat to fly up into the air then into the pile of boat mobiles that are in the accident. Mrs. Puff blows up to a big puffer fish] SpongeBob: Looks like you guys forgot your boat smarts! [laughs and drives off, making dust and the low quality video recorder stops] Mrs. Puff: [frustratedly] Never mind.",

        "synopsis": "As the episode begins, SpongeBob and Patrick sing \"Squidward Had a Krabby Patty,\" which is to the tune of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\" Squidward becomes very annoyed, so he tells them to stop. However, they ignore him and continue singing, so Squidward goes to the door of the kitchen to yell at them, but just as he reaches the door, the door swings open as SpongeBob comes out singing, and it hits Squidward in the face. Squidward is in great pain, and yells at SpongeBob to take him to the hospital. At the hospital, SpongeBob is nervously pacing up and down and chewing on Krusty Krab hats, when Incidental 116 opens the door to the waiting room. SpongeBob bursts into tears and asks if Squidward is going to be okay, to which Incidental 116 replies by saying they will not know for two weeks.SpongeBob worries about his accident with Squidward for two weeks later, until Incidental 116 calls him into the hospital and give Squidward a bouquet of flowers. He gives one of the flowers to Mable, who is apparently suffering from amnesia, and then he walks into Squidward's operation room. Incidental 116 says that Squidward had asked to keep SpongeBob far away from him, but SpongeBob promises to stay out of the way. Just as Incidental 116 is about to cut the bandages, SpongeBob stalls him long enough so he can't see Squidward's face by interrupting him, saying to not rush it. He then interrupts a second time, asking if Squidward has enough \"emensmansera,\" to which the doctor says he has never heard of. SpongeBob then interrupts a third time, saying the readings on a brain meter (which is actually a television) are wrong, and a fourth time with a television program. SpongeBob interrupts once more as the doctor angrily wonders what the reason is as SpongeBob ironically says it was to apologize for interrupting him, and the bandages are finally cut. Squidward's face is so handsome it causes the doctor and a nurse to faint, and when Squidward looks in a mirror, he is thrilled to see he really is handsome. While Squidward prepares to leave the hospital, SpongeBob reminds him not to forget to enjoy being too handsome.As Squidward is walking through town, multiple fish see him, call him handsome, and faint. One fish crashes a car, an old lady regains the ability to walk, a blind fish regains the ability to see, and one fish becomes able to fly. Many fish begin taking photographs of Squidward, and one asks for an autograph. Squidward is enjoying the attention. A limo is waiting for Squidward and returns him to Squidward's house. Many fans follow the limo and take pictures of Squidward as he walks to his house. Squidward goes to sleep, while a group of fish is chanting 'handsome handsome handsome' outside his house all night. In the morning, Squidward remembers he is handsome, and goes out to greet the crowd, which has grown significantly over night. Suddenly, the fans start trying to take his shirt and eyelids, and Squidward rushes back inside. Squidward instead decides to play them a song on his clarinet, and the crowd cheers for him. But then, someone grabs his clarinet from him as he is leaning out the window, and that fish is attacked by the crowd who also want the clarinet.Squidward tries to take his mind off the incident by having an herbal bath, but someone reaches through the window and grabs his soap and Squidward calls the person out, saying that his grandmother gave him that soap. Squidward tries to enjoy his bath, but a huge fish emerges from his bath, and then fish start coming through his window, door, and even toilet, and try to 'get' him as a bunch of peeping toms. Squidward jumps out the window, but the crowd is still outside, and they start to approach him. He runs into SpongeBob's house, who is trimming his toenails, and Squidward begs SpongeBob to help him get his old life back. SpongeBob and Squidward cut through the crowd and run to the Krusty Krab, with the crowd chasing after them.When they arrive, Mr. Krabs is thrilled to see a crowd of people outside the Krusty Krab and tells the crowd they can pay to touch Squidward. Squidward asks SpongeBob to smash the door in his face before Mr. Krabs opens the doors to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob does not want to hurt Squidward on purpose, but Squidward tells SpongeBob to hurt him, or he will hurt SpongeBob, so SpongeBob repeatedly slams the door in Squidward's face. This ends up making Squidward even more handsome, then suddenly a shoe falls through a hole in the roof. Before it hits Squidward in the head, SpongeBob shoves him out of the way, and he stumbles face first into a pole. This returns Squidward's face to normal and the crowd leaves in disappointment. In an attempt to bring them back, Mr. Krabs repeatedly slams the door into Squidward's face to make handsome one last time, but to no avail, which ends the episode from there.",

Just... just don't. Purple Doctorfish: We won't know for two weeks. You'll just have to wait. [Purple Doctorfish leaves] SpongeBob: Two weeks? I'll never make it. [SpongeBob falls down. Two weeks later, SpongeBob comes into the hospital with a bouquet of flowers] Nurse Rechid: Mornin', SpongeBob. You're early today. SpongeBob: Good morning, Nurse Rechid.

SpongeBob: [laughs] Don't worry, Mabel. I'll bet your amnesia's gonna wear off in no time. [walks away] Mabel: My what? SpongeBob: [flops into Squidward's room] Hiya, Squidward! I've been practicing how to flop on my back. Squidward: [muffled shouting. His head is covered with bandages] Purple Doctorfish: We can't really have you in here today. I'm going to be removing Squidward's bandages and he made me swear to keep you far away from him. SpongeBob: It has been two weeks already? [SpongeBob Smiling] . Don't worry, doc.

[takes out some scissors and is about to remove the bandages on Squidward's face] SpongeBob: Don't rush it! Sorry, go ahead. [the doctor continues his work, but SpongeBob interrupts him again] Wait! Purple Doctorfish: [angrily] What is it? SpongeBob: Are you sure that the patient has enough emensmansera? Purple Doctorfish: I have no idea what that is. Please. Just let me work. SpongeBob: Very well, doctor. Carry on. Purple Doctorfish: May I? SpongeBob: Hold it! The readings on this brain meter are all wrong! We must postpone the operation! Purple Doctorfish: That is a television set put here for the patient's enjoyment. And it's not even plugged into the wall! SpongeBob: You're right, doctor. Proceed with operation sever. Hold it! Purple Doctorfish: Now what?! [On the television] Nurse: Doctor, we can't do this. Surely we can use a less dangerous procedure. After all, we have to start thinking about... the welfare of... [Purple Doctorfish turns off the TV] SpongeBob: Wait! Purple Doctorfish: [impatiently] What could it possibly be this time?! SpongeBob: I just want to say sorry for interrupting you before. [Purple Doctorfish twitches his eye for a second. He finally trims the bandages and unwraps them as SpongeBob watches. When all the bandages are off, there is a bright light that shines in his face.] Purple Doctorfish: [gasps] I... I... I can't believe it. [faints] Squidward: SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Yeah? Squidward: How does it look? SpongeBob: [looks at Squidward's face and is likewise stunned] Great Neptune... Squidward: Come on. Spit it out. I can take it. Nurse: Time for your medicine, Mister... [sees Squidward's new look] Mister... Mister... [flirting gesture] Handsome! Ohhh... [melts] Squidward: What did she call me? SpongeBob: Handsome. But she spelled it wrong. Squidward: Quick, hand me that mirror! [SpongeBob hands him a mirror, and he notices his new handsome look] What the...? Wait a second. That nurse was right. I am handsome! SpongeBob: Squidward, you're not handsome. You're a hunk! [Scene cuts to the Bikini Bottom city. People start to notice Squidward's new look; one female fish gasps as he is reflected into her eyes.] Incidental 48: So handsome! [faints] Incidental 64: Handsome! [then more women faint] Incidental 107: [crash!] Hello, Handsome. SpongeBob: Gee, Squidward. People really seem to be noticing how handsome you are now. You might even be more handsome than before. Incidental 8: [screams] So handsome! SpongeBob: If that's even possible. Incidental 87: Uh... [screams, then starts walking] It's a miracle... I can walk. Harold: [takes off sunglasses] I can see! Fat Student Fish: I can fly! [goes on top of a building and starts to fly] Uh-oh. My shoe's untied. [his shoe falls off] Female Teen Fish: Mr. Handsome, can I have your autograph? No! Not in the book, on my retainer. [they are about to cross the street until a limousine enters their way, with the driver opening the door for them] SpongeBob and Squidward: A limousine?! [shocked then the crowd cheers] Squidward: Well SpongeBob, earlier today my spine was hurting, now I'm resting on fine leather upholstery. [Limo stops at Squidward's house while the crowd cheers for them] SpongeBob: Well, I'm gonna go clip my toenails Squidward, don't forget to enjoy being handsome. Squidward: Oh, don't worry.

Squidward: Good morning my people! I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, but even I [laughs] strange as it seems, need my beauty sleep. Incidental 36: I want his shirt! Incidental 41: I want his eyelids! [crowd rips his shirt, causing Squidward to run back inside home] Squidward: I guessed I kept them waiting a little too long. I know, a little music should soothe their hunger. [plays the clarinet] Bill: Hey what is that sound? Harold: Wait it's him! The handsome man! [crowd cheers] Squidward: Beautiful and talented. what more do they want? Don't worry folks, there's more where that came from... Hey! [a guy steals his clarinet] Thaddeus: I got the clarinet! [crowd rips the shirt off the fish who got Squidward's clarinet and breaks his clarinet] Squidward: [smells the liquid soap] There's nothing a little foaming herbal bath can't cure. [a female fish takes his soap] Hey, my grandmother gave me that soap! Well, no one ever said it'd be easy being so handsome, Squiddy. You'll just start getting used to.. [screams as a big female fish with 4 eyes pops out of his bath tub] Big Female Fish: Hi, Handsome. Incidental 107: Handsome! Incidental 49: Handsome! Incidental 14: Handsome! Squidward: [gasps] Incidental 14: Let's get him! Squidward: [screams and jumps out of the window and goes to SpongeBob's house while SpongeBob is clipping his toenails] SpongeBob! You gotta help me! They stole my bubble bath! Public life ain't all it's cracked up to be. I want my old life back. SpongeBob: Hmmm... I know just what to do. [crowd chases Squidward and SpongeBob until they reach the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs: Squidward? What have you done? You know what the Krusty Krab means to me, don't ya? And you took it upon yourself to bring all these, these customers, to me. Hey, don't worry folks, There's plenty of Squidward to go around. So everybody just line up and get your pocketbooks out, first will be a small fee of $14.98 per person, everyone will get the opportunity to touch Squidward. Squidward: We don't have much time! Take the door and change me back. Mr. Krabs: And I'll even throw in a free soft drink for an extra $3. Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob. Take the door and smash my face back! SpongeBob: I can't! It was one thing doing it by accident, but I can't hurt you on purpose. Squidward: You better hurt me or I'm really gonna hurt you! SpongeBob: Well, okay... Squidward: Now don't hold back, SpongeBob. Just really let me have it. SpongeBob: Just remember, Squidward, this is going to hurt me more than it's going to hurt you. Squidward: Uhhh... okay, just let me just memori-- [SpongeBob slams the door on Squidward's face] Dooowww! Hey, I wasn't ready. [slam!] Would you mind waiting ‘til I... [slam!] SpongeBob: Hang on, you're starting to look like your old self again. [slam!] Nope. Still too handsome. [slam!] It's still not working. Maybe I'm not doing it hard enough. [slam!] Squidward: Uh... hang on a sec... [SpongeBob slams the door on him over and over again] let me... uhhh... [Squidward groans as his face becomes even more handsome] SpongeBob: [shocked] Eeee! Squidward, you're even more handsome now! [crowd cheers even louder] And the crowd is in a frenzy. Squidward: Well, SpongeBob, it was you who got me into this mess, now you have to get me out again! SpongeBob: I know, Squidward! I'll think of something! Huh! I just need, I just... [a shoe from outside will be hitting Squidward] Squidward: [in slow motion] Got me into... SpongeBob: [springs into action, still at normal speed] Squidward! Look out for that falling shoe! Squidward: Huh? [SpongeBob pushes Squidward out of the way; Squidward screams while he is dramatically flying to the pole. The scene briefly cuts to SpongeBob, who gets hit by the shoe at normal speed and has no feeling. After a while, Squidward hits the pole.] SpongeBob: Squidward... Squidward: [his face is back to normal while everyone is shocked] SpongeBob? SpongeBob: You're back! Oh, Squidward... I love you no matter how many times we smash your face. [hugs Squidward] Squidward: I almost wish that meant something. [crowd leaves after seeing Squidward not handsome anymore] Mr. Krabs: Hey, where you going? Don't leave me! Please! I'm beggin' ya! Look. I can make him handsome again. Watch! [slams the door on Squidward's face repeatedly] See? [slam!] He's getting handsome. It just takes a little [slam!] effort, just a little [slam!] elbow grease. [The camera zooms away from the Krusty Krab, as it vibrates whenever Mr. Krabs slams the door on Squidward.] Please! Come back! [the episode ends as it fades to black]",

        "synopsis": "In the beginning of the episode, Squidward is at home, about to watch House Fancy, a program showcasing fancy homes. As the host, Nicholas Withers, introduces the episode's first guest, Squidward gets a phone call from Squilliam Fancyson. He reveals that the guest is none other than himself, and his phone call was just to show off to Squidward, who then notices Squilliam and Nicholas on the show.Squidward watches in anger and grows jealous as Squilliam shows off the various features of his house, which is several stories high, and includes an elevator with a built-in hot tub, decorative toilets with golden toilet paper holders, a garden on the rooftop, as well as a 130-foot sculpture of Squilliam's unibrow that consists solely of gilded doorknobs.In the end, Squidward gets so fed up with Squilliam’s boastful attitude, that he calls Nicholas and tells him that he has a much fancier home than Squilliam. Nicholas gives Squidward two hours to prepare. Squidward realizes what he has done and desperately tries to make his house fancier (as well as himself, as he mentions how he doesn’t have any time to wash up), but with no success. He spots SpongeBob outside his window, who admits he has been spying on Squidward for days, right down to watching him watch House Fancy.Squidward reluctantly allows SpongeBob to help, but SpongeBob admits that Patrick is borrowing his brain for the weekend (in exchange for a couple of chocolate bars), and each time Squidward gives him a task, SpongeBob does it recklessly, leading to disastrous results, and in one task, SpongeBob inadvertently wounds Squidward’s foot. Soon, Squidward hears the doorbell ring, and assuming that it is Nicholas, he tells SpongeBob to clean up the mess with a vacuum while he heads to the other room to dress his wound. But once again, SpongeBob does the task recklessly by attempting to increase the vacuum’s power (after assuming how messy Squidward’s house is), only to inadvertently cause it to go haywire and suck up everything in the living room just as Squidward returns from dressing his wound. SpongeBob attempts to turn it off, but he gets sucked in. Squidward attempts to fix the situation while desperately telling the person outside the door to wait, only for the person to reveal themselves to be Patrick, who needs to use Squidward's restroom. Once Patrick leaves, Squidward's toilet comes to life for a brief moment and crawls out of the bathroom, before jumping into Squidward's arms and immediately dying from whatever Patrick did. Patrick then briefly returns to give SpongeBob his brain back (unaware that SpongeBob is stuck in the vacuum). Fortunately, the vacuum sucks brain and into the bag, where SpongeBob (who’s eating either one or both of the two chocolate bars) retrieves it. Immediately after that, the vacuum reaches “Full Capacity”, causing the vacuum bag to increase in size and explode, destroying the house (though naturally, the two neighbors survive). However, when Nicholas and Squilliam come over and see what’s left of Squidward's house, the former views it as a work of abstract art and proclaims that his house is even better than the latter's, much to Squilliam’s shock and Squidward’s surprise. Nicholas then declares that Squidward's house will be featured in a 1-hour commercial-free \"House Fancy\" special and Squidward is now crowned House Fancy Prince Of The Year.The ending of the episode leads to Squilliam crying since he has lost, and Squidward is happy with the help of SpongeBob, who tries to comfort Squilliam by giving him some advice in redecorating.",

        "transcript": "[The episode starts at Squidward's house. Squidward is humming to his favorite real estate show, the \"House Fancy\" theme song while doing these activities. He places some tea on the table in front of his couch, then gets a stack of cookies, then picks up the remote, then fluffs both of his pillows, then sits down and turns on the TV. A square and a triangle are moving around, Squidward sips his tea, then the shapes turn into a house. A bird flies on the house, and a sound bubble comes out of his mouth that says \"House Fancy.\" A rainbow and a chimney appears on the house, then the scene opens like a door, revealing Nicholas \"Nick\" Withers.] Nick: Hello, and welcome one and all, to a super special episode of House Fancy. I'm your host, Nicholas Withers. [Nicholas Withers appears on the screen] Our first, very special guest on today's show will be none other than... [Squidward's phone rings] Squidward: Oh. [Squidward walks up to the phone. Then says hello's] Hello. Hello. Uh... [picks up the phone, and says it in a sweet voice] Hellooo! Squilliam: Hellooo! Squidward: [gasps] This isn't Squilliam Fancyson, my life long rival who I met in high school band class, is it? Squilliam: The same. You wouldn't happen to be watching House Fancy, would you? Squidward: I was, until you called. Squilliam: Well, Squiddy, I enjoy our chats, but my catered lunch awaits. And you know how hard being fabulous is on an empty stomach! [laughs] Squidward: Wait, why did you ask me if I was watching House Fancy? Nick: [heard through phone] Sorry, Squilliam, but we've gotta get back to the show. Squidward: Who's that talking in the background? Squilliam: Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry, Nicky dear. Well, toodle loo, Squidward. [it is revealed that he is on the program] Enjoy the program. Nick: Okay, folks, we'll be right back after these important messages. [Squidward drops his tea cup. Scene then cuts to Nick and Squilliam] Welcome back to House Fancy. I'm Nicholas Withers. Here next to me is Squilliam Fancyson. Squilliam: Hello, peasants. [Squidward is angry] Nick: Let me start by saying what a lovely facade you have, Mr. Fancyson. Squilliam: Why, thank you, Nick. Nick: And your house doesn't look too bad either. [both laugh] Squilliam: Oh, Nicky. Nick: Camera crew, can we get a shot of Mr. Fancyson's fabulous house, please? [zooms out, revealing that it looks like Squidward's house] Squidward: Hey, that's no better than my house! [goes up, revealing that it is much larger than Squidward's house. Cut to the inside of his house] Squilliam: I bid you welcome, to my foyer. Nick: It's simply glorious! Squidward: [mocking] It's simply glorious! Squilliam: It truly is, Nicky. Nick: It's like I've died and gone to fancy heaven! [scene cuts to the opening background. The bird's head gets replaces the \"O,\" then cuts back to Squilliam's house] Is that what I think it is? Squilliam: It sure is! It's a gilded door knob. Nick: Absolutely magical! Squilliam: Absolutely imported. Nick: May I? Squilliam: But, of course. [Nick turns it] Nick: Ohhh... Lovely. Squilliam: Isn't it? Nick: Well, I have to say, Squilliam, and I think that I'm speaking for all of our viewers out there when I'm saying this. You, are truly a fancy man. Squilliam: Well, all this gushing is perfectly deserved. [Squidward is mad] And now, I would like to present to you my most favorite room in the house. [Squilliam opens the door, revealing the bathroom] It's all custom. Ah, look at this, it's my jewel-encrusted toilet paper holder. Nick: Such class! [Squidward is even more angrier, then some houses turn into the title, then cuts to Nick and Squilliam] Squilliam: Come, let me show you the roof! Nick: An elevator? Squilliam: Watch your step. [Squilliam opens the elevator, then they step inside, and press the button that says \"Roof\"] This may take a while. Just sit back and relax. [water fills some of the elevator] Nick: What the!? A whirlpool bath elevator? Squilliam: I brought some soap. [Pours out soap. They then get to the roof] All ashore. Welcome to my rooftop garden! Romantic grotto, sparkling berry mineral soda waterfall, and my personal favorite, a 130-foot-long sculpture of my unibrow! Nick: It's huge, and... lifelike! Squilliam: If you look closely, you'll notice it's made entirely out of gilded doorknobs. [Closes in on the sculpture] Nick: You have the fanciest... [phone rings] Squilliam: Eh, what? Nick: You have the fanciest... [phone rings again] Squilliam: I have the fanciest ring? [rings again] Nick: No, your phone is ringing. Squilliam: Oh. [walks up to phone, and picks it up] [in happy sing song voice] Hello? Oh, yeah, hang on. [talking to Nick] Uh, it's for you. Nick: Hello. Hello. [talks on phone] Hello. [cuts back to Squidward] Squidward: Hello, my name is Squidward Tentacles, and my house is far fancier than that slob Squilliam's! Nick: Really? Squidward: Really! Nick: Okay, we'll be at your house in two hours with a camera crew. [hangs up] Squidward: [shocked] Two hours? But I haven't even had time to wash my hair. [screams] There's a stain on the rug! I'll just use this chair to hide it. There we go. Now I'll just... [screams again] There's a hideous hole in the wall! I'll just use this painting to cover it up. Perfect. [screams again, because there is a faded spot where the painting was] Oh, no! [looks at the time] Oh, I'll never get this place in shape in time! [notices SpongeBob in the window, who quickly disappears. Squidward runs to the window] SpongeBob! How long have you been spying on me? SpongeBob: Umm... What day is it today? Squidward: It's the day you go away and never come back. SpongeBob: But, Squidward, if I do that, then how am I going to help you get your house ready for the big TV show? Squidward: How did you know about that? SpongeBob: I was spying on you. Squidward: Do you want me to get the cops down here again? Because... [looks at the time again, then sighs] All right, fine. But one slip up and you are out of here! Comprendo? [SpongeBob is behind him] SpongeBob: Mucho comprendo, Señor Habanero! [Cuts to later] Squidward: All right. First, I'm going to give you something so simple, a person without a brain could even get it done right. SpongeBob: Whoo, that's good, 'cause I lent my brain to Patrick for the weekend. Squidward: Really? SpongeBob: No, not really... He traded me these two chocolate bars for it. Squidward: I don't care! Just use this paint to cover up that faded part on the wall right there. Don't touch anything else! SpongeBob: Okay. [SpongeBob picks up the brush, then throws it away and absorbs the paint, then splatters the paint around] Squidward: SpongeBob, what was that noise? [screams] Skin me alive and drench me in boiling oil! What have you done to my living room?! I told you just to paint the faded spot! SpongeBob: Well, it all looked kinda faded. [Squidward hisses, then looks at the clock again] Squidward: Never mind! Maybe it won't show up on camera. Here, help me move this sofa. SpongeBob: You got it, Squiddy. Where are we moving her to? Squidward: Hang on, I'm trying to get the grip on the thing. Now don't move it till I say... [SpongeBob moves it on his foot and he screams in pain] Okay, it's on my foot. Now don't... [SpongeBob moves it again, causing him to scream again] SpongeBob: Okay. [moves it again, ripping off Squidward's toenail] Squidward: [screams] SpongeBob, I told you not to move it until I say... [SpongeBob drops it on his foot and he screams again] Why do you keep moving it? SpongeBob: 'Cause you keep saying \"ow!\" [Squidward screams, and lifts it up] Squidward: I don't need you! I can move it myself. [slips on toenail, and trips] SpongeBob: Wow, Squidward, you're so strong! [there is a crash] And you split your sofa in half! It'll be really easy to move now. [doorbell rings] Squidward: Oh, no, they're already here! Go get a vacuum and clean up all the sofa bits. I've gotta run upstairs and dress my wound! SpongeBob: Roger! [SpongeBob walks on screen with a vacuum] Okay, Squidward, found the vacuum! Squidward? Well, I'll just vacuum for him. [starts vacuuming] Hmm, Squidward's house is really messy. I'm going to need some extra power. [SpongeBob struggles to flip the switch, but nothing happens, and the switch breaks causing him to fly backwards.. The vacuum goes haywire, and vacuums up a rug, a plant, a sculpture of Squidward, then the sofa, then the book case, and then everything else making it's bag increase in size every time.] Squidward: Okay, SpongeBob, I finished... What the? [everything in Squidward's house is in the vacuum, which looks as if it's about to explode] SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward! I'll turn it off. [SpongeBob tries to turn it off, but then gets sucked in] Squidward: Come out of there. [doorbell rings again] Uh, hang on, please. [Squidward tries to push the bag, and the door bell rings again] Please, just one more minute, Nick! [door opens, and it's Patrick] Patrick: Who's Nick? Sorry, Squidward. I couldn't wait any longer, I've gotta use your toilet. No questions! Thanks. [Patrick runs into the bathroom. We hear him groan, then the toilet flushes, then he comes out] Phew! I wouldn't go in there for a couple days. Or weeks. [He leaves the house. Squidward's toilet comes out of his bathroom groaning] Squidward's toilet: Please, please, somebody put me out of my misery! [toilet jumps into Squidward's hands, coughing] Have mercy on my soul...! [toilet dies, then Patrick opens the door again] Patrick: Oh, hey, Squidward, if you see SpongeBob, can you give him his brain back? I was borrowing it for the weekend. I'll just set it, uh... here. [Patrick puts his brain on the floor] See ya! [walks away, and the vacuum then sucks it up. SpongeBob is eating the chocolate bar] SpongeBob: Thank you, Patrick! [The ground shakes and the vacuum says that it's on full capacity] Squidward: Oh, no! [The vacuums bag starts expanding in size uncontrollably and starts crushing Squidward. The vacuum then explodes and destroys Squidward's house. Scene then cuts to the House Fancy background, then to Nick] Nick: Hello, and welcome back to House Fancy. We're arriving at the home of Mr. Squidward Tentacles, who claims his house is far fancier than that of Squilliam Fancyson. Let's take a look. [both are shocked because of Squidward's house] Well, I, I, I... I'm not quite sure how to say this... Squilliam: Go ahead, say it. Nick: Squidward Tentacles, you seem to have ushered in an entire new era in house fanciness! Squilliam: Huh? Squidward: I have-... I have? Nick: What you have done here hearkens back to the illustrious post-primitive movement popularized by famous designer Saul Limpkins. Say, was he a big inspiration for you? Squidward: Why, yes. I've studied him for... years! [Squilliam gulps] Nick: I would like to announce, that Squidward's house will be featured in an hour long, commercial free House Fancy special, and Squidward will be crowned House Fancy prince of the year! An honor which was originally to be bestowed upon Squilliam, but now isn't. [Squilliam falls] Squidward: Yay! [Squilliam starts crying] SpongeBob: Oh, don't worry, Squilliam, I might be able to get Squidward to help you redecorate. He is a personal friend of mine. You know success hasn't gone to his head? He is still the same old great guy, he has not changed. [Squilliam cries harder]",

        "synopsis": "The episode starts off at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, everyone is bored hoping for the class to end while she is talking about steering and SpongeBob is taking notes in an exciting personality. When class ends, Mrs. Puff reminds the class that they are going on a field trip to the Bikini Bottom Museum of Boating tomorrow and the bus will pick them up at 8:00 AM. When SpongeBob realizes that this is finally his chance to impress Mrs. Puff and get his driver's license, he reads a 7,400-page book called The History of All Boating Ever.... When SpongeBob finishes the book at 7:59 AM on the next day, he ends up falling asleep when he realizes that tomorrow is today and he is going to be late for the bus.He races the bus once it leaves his house. Mrs. Puff, wanting to go without SpongeBob, tells Nat, the bus driver, to speed up. But SpongeBob suddenly comes in through the window. While SpongeBob begins talking to Mrs. Puff, she realizes SpongeBob's bad smell and gives him a bottle of Shower in a Can. SpongeBob then starts talking about the trivia of boating, which starts to give Mrs. Puff a headache. So, when the class finally arrives at the museum, SpongeBob is paying no attention as he is still talking about boating to Mrs. Puff, crashes into the front window and gets converted into a puddle outside the bus door, he then is back up again when he sees the museum in front of him.Mrs. Puff explains it was the largest boat ever that is now converted into a museum and can no longer be operated unless it goes to its yearly check at the port. Throughout the day, SpongeBob keeps interrupting Mrs. Puff to tell the students what she is about to say, much to her chagrin. Right when the class is about to leave, Mrs. Puff notices that SpongeBob has gone missing, but it turns out that he was in the driving room of the boat. He turns on the air conditioners on very high without noticing, which accidentally starts the boat.When Mrs. Puff finds SpongeBob as she comes back into the museum, she tries to stop the boat when she noticed it has been started, but she has never driven any boat so advanced before. So when she notices that the boat is going to crash into Bikini Bottom after SpongeBob turns the boat on Turbo Speed, SpongeBob tries to stop the boat by battening down the hatches, lowering the anchor, uttering a hearty seaman's laugh, and doing the reverse 720 tailspin. And right when the boat is about to destroy Bikini Bottom, it stops, only tapping the first building. When Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob leave the boat, Mrs. Puff gives SpongeBob his driver's license due to her impression.However, she is outraged when she finds out that the museum owner was simply taking the boat into Bikini Bottom for a checkup at the port and that he was doing all of the driving. As a result she angrily tears up SpongeBob's driver's license, leaving the latter heartbroken. The museum owner then suggests that they should go get some ice cream to cheer SpongeBob up while he had the pin of becoming an Honorary Sea Legs as his bright side. When the three are about to go have ice cream, SpongeBob notices that the headlights of the boat are still on. As he runs back inside, the museum owner and Mrs. Puff try to tell SpongeBob to not touch anything, but the latter didn't listen and he flips the boat on its opposite side as Mrs. Puff inflates once again, ending the episode.",

You now see the importance of proper steering and a properly calibrated anchor... [SpongeBob writes it down and puts the paper inside his head] ...which brings us to the subject of rudder maintenance. [bell rings. Everyone runs outside except SpongeBob] SpongeBob: Barnacles! Just as we were getting to the nitty-gritty! Mrs. Puff: Wait a minute, class!

[starts laughing and \"drives\" his chair out the door and makes boating noises] See you tomorrow, Mrs. P.! [starts laughing again] Mrs. Puff: Neptune, give me strength! [Setting goes to SpongeBob at his house at night in his library.] SpongeBob: Let's see. Ah, there she is. Whoa! [finds his boating history book and falls on the ground with the book and Gary meows] What is this, Gary? Why, it's the complete history of all boating ever and I'm going to memorize it tonight for the big field trip tomorrow. [Gary meows again] I'm perfectly capable of reading 7,400 pages and still getting my required eight hours of sleep before the bus picks me up at promptly at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get started. [Gary moves away] All right, let's see what this little pamphlet is all about. [starts reading] \"Chapter 1: In the beginning, Neptune created the sail.\" French Narrator: 7:59 a.m. SpongeBob: \"...but such tragedies will be avoided with the flying boat of the future. The end.\" [looks really exhausted from reading 7,400 pages] Time for a little shuteye before... [the camera focuses on a closeup of his bloodshot eyes with boogers, and he closes his eyes, but then his alarm rings. He opens them] Oh, Mrs. Puff, can't this wait till tomorrow? [closes his eyes again then also opens them] Hang on a minute, it is tomorrow! [runs out his door and sees the bus and runs for it] Hey, wait! Hey! Mrs. Puff! Please stop the bus! [sees Mrs. Puff through the window and knocks] Bus Driver: What was that? Mrs. Puff: Nothing, uhh, just keep driving. [SpongeBob knocks on the window again] Step on it! [The bus driver puts the pedal to metal.] SpongeBob: Wait! Mrs. Puff: Phew. [SpongeBob's face is on the window, Mrs. Puff screams and he gets inside] SpongeBob: No worries, I made it. Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, you look terrible. [SpongeBob’s face looks exhausting] SpongeBob: I assure you, I am well rested and ready to learn. Who knows, Mrs. Puff? Before the day is out you may have learned something yourself. [Mrs. Puff smells SpongeBob's odor, sprays \"Shower in a Can\" on him and he smells better] Hey, Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: Yes, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: I made this for you. Mrs. Puff: Made what? SpongeBob: [holds out a model of a tiny boat] This, the H.M.S. Pinafore, at 1 to 8,427 scale of course. Mrs. Puff: Thank you, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: Yes, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Do you know how many rowers it takes to propel a trireme? Mrs. Puff: Well, that would be... SpongeBob: Do you know which boat is fastest on record? Mrs. Puff: Wasn't that the... SpongeBob: Did you know in the future that all boats will be powered by dolphin manure? [screen zooms in to SpongeBob] Did you know that the H.M.S. Bluetoes was originally a racing boat before it became the royal family's private yacht? Do you know what scuttling is? What's bigger, a flotilla or a fleet? Did you know... [time passes] Ever been on a... [the bus stops at the museum and SpongeBob flies to the windshield] Bus Driver: We're here. [SpongeBob goes out the door and notices the Boating Museum] Mrs. Puff: Welcome, class, to the Boating Museum. This enormous vessel was once the largest in all the seas, but now that has been converted into a museum, it no longer moves. SpongeBob: Actually, it gets taken to port once a year for maintenance. Mrs. Puff: If you don't mind, SpongeBob, I'll be doing the teaching today. SpongeBob: No problemo, Mrs. P. [Mrs. Puff and the rest enter the museum with a room with many boats] Mrs. Puff: Here it is, class. The most extensive collection of seafaring history ever assembled, from giant naval vessels to more modest craft like this clamming boat. SpongeBob: I'd say this baby can hold up to... ten clam fishers. Mrs. Puff: Uh, sure, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Why, I bet they reel in up to 50 clams a day. Mrs. Puff: Moving along. [they go to a big boat] Over here we have the Sandy Nub. It was a cargo ship used to bring back exotic spices from faraway lands. SpongeBob: [laughs] With two direct-action steam turbines producing 6,500 horsepower geared up to triple screws, [snaps his fingers] it'll get your spices where they need to go. Mrs. Puff: [in a mad voice] Thank you again, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: It's working! She's noticing my vast of knowledge! I can now taste the sweet, sweet lamination of a fresh boating license. [Setting goes to another big boat.] Mrs. Puff: This, class, is the Lady Scallion. SpongeBob: ...named after the captain's strict diet of scallions, of which the crew complained and the captain's [makes a P.U. sign] odor strongly resembled. [the kids start taking pictures of him] For four years this brigantine explored distant lands discovering places unknown to anyone besides the people [Mrs. Puff expresses a furious face] who already lived there. [She growls. SpongeBob taps on Mrs. Puff] You ready to give me that license yet, Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: [angry voice] Oh, you're going to get it all right. SpongeBob: [squeals] I knew it! [They go to more places while SpongeBob informs the class and Mrs. Puff doesn't get a chance. They go to a boat and Mrs. Puff tells them about it, but is interrupted by SpongeBob, who is looking through a telescope at the top. The kids cheer, Mrs. Puff makes an angry face. After the montage, they then walk out of the museum.] Mrs. Puff: Okay, this is the end of the tour. Anything to add, SpongeBob? [doesn't see him] SpongeBob? SpongeBob: [turns his chair around inside the museum still] Oh boy, here it is! The main controls! Just look at all this stuff! There's the triple oscillator, and there's the hoist pulley, and there's the booby trap, and there's the long range mast knob, and there's a hot dog with extra mustard. [gasps] And there is the starter mechanism. That, right there. [points at the Air Conditioner button] A/C, hmmm...That's short for \"automatic conditionata,\" and that's fancy fancy talk for \"Let's get this party started. Like, instantly!\" [presses A/C button, the fast air moves towards SpongeBob, who pushes the vent to the left] Tartar sauce..! Whew. [the fast air turns the boat on and an alarm occurs and gears and engines move then the boat moves] Man, I'm glad that's over. Oh, that's a nice touch, what a soothing projection screen. [glass ticks and SpongeBob looks behind] Mrs. Puff: That's not a projection screen! [runs towards SpongeBob and sits on his lap] SpongeBob, stop it right now! SpongeBob: Yes, ma’am. [turns the turbo speed on then boat goes faster] Mrs. Puff: Oh, sweet Poseidon. Move aside. [pushes SpongeBob away] I gotta stop this ship before it plows into Bikini Bottom! Uh, uh, let's see. The first thing to turn off is the... Uh, oh, dear Neptune! I've never driven anything this advanced before. [pulls SpongeBob back] SpongeBob, I hope you know what you were talking about, because it's up to you now. SpongeBob: Okay. [tries the steering wheel] Mrs. Puff: We don't have much time. In a few minutes, we'll be flattening millions of innocent lives! SpongeBob: Innocent lives?! Mrs. Puff: And you're the only one that can save them. SpongeBob: The only one...that can...save...them?! Mrs. Puff: Yes! And what I want you to do [SpongeBob's face turns into a frown] is ummm, tighten the gurneys, then survey the poop deck, and... SpongeBob: Stop! I know what to do. [pulls out a pirate hat and puts it onto his head] I read a book. Chapter 1, batten down the hatches. [all doors and windows were shut] Next, lower anchor. [the anchor lowers down, but gets stuck on railings] Oh no! [as screen shakes] The anchor is stuck. I’m going to free it manually. I'll be right back. [jumps out of the control center, flies towards the anchor and pulls the anchor with a horse gallop sound and when anchor is free, he swings back and cuts to the control center] Done and done. Thirdly, utter a hearty seaman's laugh. [laughs like a pirate but harsher] Mrs. Puff: Oh, my gravy. He even knows the hearty laugh! He has been doing his homework! SpongeBob: [still laughs] And finally, the coup de grace. The only way to park the largest ship ever built, [zooms to SpongeBob's face] is by performing the Reverse 720 Tailspin. Mrs. Puff: [gasps] But that's never been attempted before! SpongeBob: You're right, it hasn't. [says sentence with a surprise] Not until now! [the ship spins and does a backflip and spins again then returns to it's position. Cuts to a scene where Bikini Bottom is shown in the ship's windshield and stops with a tiny crash on an apartment and both SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff sighs] Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I don't know how, [her face turns into a smile] but you did it. You saved us all. Let's get off this thing. [Cut into a scene where they get off the ship] And the way you pulled the anchor out, genius! I never thought I'd say this, but here's your driver's license. [SpongeBob screams and slowly grabs the license] SpongeBob: Oh, boy! At long last! Tugboat driver: What are you doing here? [SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff look] No one should be on board while I’m tugging the museum into port. Mrs. Puff: You mean, he's not driving this thing at all? Tugboat driver: Heck, no! [Mrs. Puff rips the license, SpongeBob saddens and pulls off the hat, looking at it; to SpongeBob] Now, don't get so down, kid! Look, for your false bravery, I’m giving your honorary Sea Legs, okay? Come on, let me buy you an ice cream. [the boat alarms softly which cuts to the scene where the headlights are on] SpongeBob: Oh, gosh. [chuckles] Headlights are on! [runs back into the ship] Mrs. Puff & Tugboat driver: Don't touch anything, you twit! [SpongeBob gets back on the boat] Tugboat driver: Run! [The ship flips sideways] Mrs. Puff: [inflates then turn to SpongeBob who pops up beside her] Good thing you studied. [Episode ends]",

        "synopsis": "One morning, Squidward is trying to sleep, when he gets waken up by SpongeBob, who is running around. Squidward says that he is \"screaming like a banshee.\" SpongeBob is convinced by Squidward that he is not normal. After Squidward goes to his home, while he is sleeping, SpongeBob sits on his body, which freaks Squidward out. SpongeBob asks Squidward how does a person become normal, but he kicks him out in such furor. He proceeds to look at a video on How to Be Normal for Beginners in order to change his ways. At work, SpongeBob slowly changes over a three-week time period, becoming a more rounded-shaped sponge without holes, lacking his buck teeth, having a small nose, and big freckle-less cheeks. He also becomes milder mannered than his usual self.Along with his new appearance and personality, SpongeBob replaces his house with a new suburban home and works in a cubicle at the Krusty Krab like \"normal\" people do. Instead of making Krabby Patties the regular way, he prints them out. Mr. Krabs likes this at first until they are eventually made flat and printed on paper. He soon loses his job after the customers notice the new tasteless Krabby Patties.SpongeBob then meets Patrick at a bus stop and Patrick asks SpongeBob if he can play with him. But, due to being normal, SpongeBob wants to do normal things rather than doing fun things. Patrick then leaves.Afterward, SpongeBob goes over to Squidward's house and talks to him. He states that Squidward is not normal, pointing out that Squidward has various abnormalities, such as a large \"bulbous\" nose, odd eyes, and wearing no pants. Angered, Squidward kicks SpongeBob out of his home.Realizing that being a \"normal\" person is not all it is cracked up to be, SpongeBob then tries to rewire himself, but that does not work, so he enlists Patrick's aid to make him abnormal again. After a trial of odd tasks, SpongeBob slowly regains his buck teeth, holes, freckles, and other former traits. However, in Patrick's home, he soon transforms back to \"normal,\" concluding that he has become \"permanently normal.\" SpongeBob and Patrick begin crying, but a few moments later, Squidward appears at the door in his \"normal\" form. This snaps SpongeBob out of his normal state and returns him back to his old self. He hugs Squidward and thanks him for making him his true self again and compliments Squidward that it is \"a wonderful weather they're having.\"",

        "transcript": "[The episode begins with a view of Conch Street. Night turns into morning where birds are chirping and SpongeBob laughs, which causes Squidward to get up from his bed and hit his head through the bed ceiling.] Squidward: Doh... What the... [groans] ...now? SpongeBob: La, la, la... [Squidward kicks his front door open and walks outside to SpongeBob's house] La-la-la, la, la-la-la... Squidward: [angrily] Stop! [SpongeBob stops] What could you possibly be trying to do this time? SpongeBob: I'm not trying to do anything. I'm just having a decent morning. Squidward: By running around and screaming like a banshee? SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, a banshee screams like this: [screams loudly and sounds of a hawk are heard. Squidward grabs SpongeBob's mouth] Squidward: There are two kinds of people. There are people that are normal... [a group of real life fish in a tank is shown] ...and then, there's you. [pokes one of SpongeBob's holes] SpongeBob: Really? Squidward: Yes, really! Maybe you should start acting a little more... normal! [growls as he walks away] SpongeBob: I'm not normal? [Squidward walks back to his house, muttering angrily, slams his door, and then sighs as he goes back to bed] Squidward? [Squidward wakes up, and then freaks out when he sees SpongeBob sitting on him] How does one become normal? Squidward: Well, how about you start by... [cuts to outside of Squidward's house where Squidward kicks SpongeBob through the wall on top of the house while shouting] Getting away from me, you little creature? SpongeBob: What's wrong with me? I need to understand normal! [cuts to inside of SpongeBob's house] \"How to be Normal.\" Hm, this videotape should help. TV: Are you tired of being called a freak? Do people throw you out of their homes? Well, do they? SpongeBob: Yes, yes, and yes. TV: Then join me, as I take you on a \"Journey into Normality.\" SpongeBob: [transfixed] Normality. TV: The life of a normal person is rather simple. [Door opens with a fish smiling and dressed professionally for work] Here is your typical average Joe on his way to work. See how he is dressed. [Hair is combed neatly] Even his hair is boring. [Zoom in on the dimples] Notice his features, nice and smooth without a crater or freckle to be seen. SpongeBob: [rubs his face] Craters and freckles? TV: In his office space, Mr. Normal, at least that's what it says on his name tag, works at a steady and monotonous pace, just as all the other normals do. Take note of how they communicate with each other. Other Mr. Normal: Hi, how are you? TV: At the end of the day, Mr. Normal packs his things and goes home to merrily start the cycle again in the morning. SpongeBob: Yeah... [Scene cut to next day at the Krusty Krab] Customer: I want one Krabby Patty. Squidward: Oh, great. SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty. [Bells rings as the food tray is presented to Squidward] What, no annoying blurbs today? [Looks through the empty kitchen window] Hmm, strangely quiet. [Walks into the kitchen to get a cup of water, but as he is getting the drink, he notices the office space behind him] SpongeBob? SpongeBob: [typing on the computer] Hi, how are ya? Squidward: What's the meaning of this? SpongeBob: I took your advice. From now on, I'm normal. [Shows nametag that reads \"Hello I'm Normal\"] Squidward: Normal, huh? SpongeBob: Yup. Squidward: Oh, really? SpongeBob: Yup. Squidward: Whatever. I know you're just waiting to say something stupid. SpongeBob: Wonderful weather we're having. Squidward: Uh, yes, it is. SpongeBob: Okay, see ya 'round. [Goes back to typing] Squidward: Yeah, I'll, uh...I'll see you. [Door opens] Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing sitting around? We need Krabby Patties out there. SpongeBob: Yes, sir. I'll do it... normally. [Cuts to Squidward riding his bike] Squidward: I wonder what got into SpongeBob... And what the heck is that?! [a normal house is sitting by Squidward's house] Whose house is this? SpongeBob: [walks up to his house] Hi, how are ya? Squidward: [slaps himself. Cuts to next day at the Krusty Krab where Squidward walks into the kitchen and greets SpongeBob] Hi, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Hi, how are ya? Squidward: Good, just heading by to get a drink. SpongeBob: Wonderful weather we're having. Squidward: It sure is. SpongeBob: Okay, see ya 'round. Squidward: Yeah... [chuckles] See ya. [chuckles] Oh, my. [slurps] I could get used to this. [A montage of SpongeBob and Squidward is shown]. French Narrator: Three weeks later... Squidward: There you are, sir. [watch beeps] Oh, yes, it's time again. I've been meaning to say this, but I've come to appreciate your demeanor lately. SpongeBob: You know, it's a funny thing, Squidward. I smoothed out the edges of my personality and the rest just followed suit. Now I am utterly normal. [smiles showing his teeth with no buck tooth. A customer biting into his flat Krabby Patty, but it's all paper. He takes it out of his mouth] Ugh! That ain't right. I will never spend money here again. Mr. Krabs: Never? Mevis: Come on, guys, these patties ain't worth the paper they're printed on. Mr. Krabs: Wait, where're you going? [paper Krabby Patty lands on his nose] SpongeBob! What are you doing back here? Do you expect the customers to eat this? And now, thanks to you, they're leaving in boat loads. [customers are rowing out of the restaurant in boats] SpongeBob: Maybe this thing is out of ink. Mr. Krabs: [sighs] No, boy, you're missing the point. You can't make Krabby Patties with ink and paper. You gotta put your heart into it, boy. Now get back to making them patties the right way and stop acting so dull. SpongeBob: What you call dull I call normal. Mr. Krabs: Well, till you decide to start making them patties the way only you can, I want you out of my place! SpongeBob: [walks out of the Krusty Krab] I guess the decision to be normal was more life-changing than I thought. [walks up to Patrick who is reading a paper at the bus stop] Hi, how are ya? Patrick: What happened to you? SpongeBob: Oh, I got normal. Patrick: Whatever that means. Hey, SpongeBob, what do you say we charge into Jellyfish Fields nets ablaze? [takes two jellyfish nets out of his pockets] SpongeBob: Let's do something normal, like window shopping. Patrick: Let's do this... [groans as he shrinks his head inside of his body and makes it reappear out of the side of his stomach] Ya-ha! Hey, your turn. SpongeBob: I think I'll pass. But I do need to defragment my hard drive, would you like to help? Patrick: Hey, listen...when you decide to do something fun, you know where to find me. [walks away in the same form] SpongeBob: Okay, see ya 'round. [rings Squidward's door bell] Hi, how are ya? Squidward: I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but please come in, SpongeBob. [Squidward pours tea into SpongeBob's cup] SpongeBob: Thank you. Tell me, what are you doing cooped up in here when the weather outside is so normal. Squidward: Well, today is dusting day. The day I dust my 483 self-portraits. SpongeBob: Wow, that's something you don't see in the average house. Squidward: You know, SpongeBob, it's okay to be a little different. [slurps his tea] SpongeBob: And you know what else is abnormal? Your nose—it's all bulbous and flappy. Your eyes are a little odd, too. Looks like your whole face could use some work. Yeah, there we go. [SpongeBob turns Squidward's face into a real live Squidward face] See? Looking normal already. [woman shrieks] Squidward: What the...? SpongeBob: One more thing, Squidward. You don't wear pants. [Squidward kicks him out of his house] Squidward: And stay out of my home! [slams the door then looks in the literally mirror and pokes his nose a little] SpongeBob: Oh, what happened? I lost my job, then my best friend, and now I'm too normal for Squidward. Maybe I have taken this normal thing too far. No problem, SpongeBob. You made yourself normal. Now all you have to do is re-weird yourself. All it'll take is a mental adjustment and some tight clenching. Now focus... [groans] and clench. [groans so much his eyes pop out] Oh, well, if I'm going to get weird, I'm going to need to see a professional. [Cuts to Patrick's house] Patrick: [tongue is twisted around] Look at the tongue. [tongue untwists itself and Patrick laughs] SpongeBob: That's very nice, Patrick, but I need you to retrain me. I want to be abnormal again. Patrick: Huh, I don't think you have what it takes. SpongeBob: Please, Patrick. If anyone can teach me the arcane art of the weird, it's you. Teach me how to be me again. Patrick: It won't be easy, but I'll do it. SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, Patrick! Patrick: But first, I'll need a garden hose and a flatbed truck, and I'll need you to remove your trousers. [Cuts to people laughing at SpongeBob who is only in his underwear] SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm feeling very self-conscious right now. Patrick: [spraying water] Try to concentrate on your first lesson in weird. [throws SpongeBob onto the streak of water] See you on the other side, buddy! [SpongeBob grunts as both Patrick and SpongeBob are sliding on a water trail that lead to a ramp on a flatbed truck that launches them into the Bikini Bottom Zoo] Susie: Mommy, mommy... what are those things? Shubie: Those are undesirables, honey. We only talk to normal people! [Shubie and her two kids walk off] Patrick: SpongeBob, the weird therapy is working. Your craters are coming back. We just have to keep pushing the boundaries. We've gotta get stranger. [Cuts to Jellyfish Fields where SpongeBob is riding on Patrick's back like a horse and catches a jellyfish in the net. Another crater comes back. Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick licking the sand and as SpongeBob is licking, his nose grows back to normal size. Cuts to Patrick and SpongeBob standing on their hands] Talk backwards. SpongeBob: Tap, erus uoy era? [SpongeBob's legs and arms are back to normal, Patrick gives a thumbs up but falls down. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick eating secret Krabby Sauce with their feet. SpongeBob grows his buck teeth back, but then something is happening to him] Patrick: It's happening. The final transformation. [SpongeBob transforms back into his normal state] SpongeBob: Huh? Patrick: What happened? SpongeBob: I don't know. I guess I became permanently normal. Patrick: [horrified and devastated] Noooo! [hugs SpongeBob and they both burst into tears] SpongeBob: I don't wanna be normal! [knock on door] Patrick: Go away! SpongeBob: Normal is not worth it! Patrick: We're in mourning! [Patrick sobs in despair] Squidward: [Patrick's rock begins to open] It's me, Squidward. I'm looking for SpongeBob. [in a normal state] Hi. How are ya? [SpongeBob is so scared and shocked at how Squidward looks that he screams, turning back into his regular self] Patrick: SpongeBob, you're back to your square shape. SpongeBob: Wow! I guess Squidward's normal looks scared me back to my original form. Thanks, buddy, you saved my life. Squidward: Wonderful weather we're having, hm? SpongeBob: It sure is, buddy. It sure is. [laughs with Patrick whilst the episode ends]",

        "synopsis": "One morning, SpongeBob wakes up to find out that Gary is missing and soon discovers that he is the only one left in all of Bikini Bottom. At first, he finds this hard to take. In a panic, he runs around town in a desperate attempt to find anyone, but to no avail.When the others do not return, SpongeBob decides to live out everyone's lives for them. He makes a bubble version of himself in his front yard, then runs to the top floor of Squidward's house, pretending to be Squidward yelling at SpongeBob for making too much noise. The latter then runs to the Krusty Krab, imitating Squidward and Mr. Krabs. He then imitates Patrick in his rock and Sandy at her treedome before running to the boating school and imitating Mrs. Puff.While in the classroom, he realizes that living out everyone's lives will not work and breaks down crying on his desk. SpongeBob's mood quickly changes when he discovers a stack of blank driver's licenses. He takes a picture of himself and prints out his own license. He then takes off with the student test boat, naming it \"Boaty,\" and joyriding throughout the city.SpongeBob and Boaty become inseparable best friends. The latter sleeps with the boat and parks it inside both his house and the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is going insane without people to talk to, and Boaty realizes this. In his closet, SpongeBob has erected a puppet of Patrick out of raw Krabby Patty meat, which he carries out a conversation with. The \"Patty-Patrick\" warns him that he cannot talk because Boaty is listening. He goes crazy from the sight of any motor vehicle, and when a bus comes, he grabs a fire axe from the cinema to chop at the bus that approaches him.To his surprise, everyone in Bikini Bottom comes out of it. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob that everyone's mysterious disappearance was really a holiday to celebrate being away from the latter for a day called National No SpongeBob Day. Before venturing off, a giant effigy of SpongeBob is erected, and then burned. Everyone then dances on the ashes to celebrate. SpongeBob is deeply saddened, not because of the holiday but that everyone was gone for so long, but Mr. Krabs tells him that the holiday is an honor, and SpongeBob feels appreciated.Patrick tells SpongeBob that the holiday is nothing compared to \"No Patrick Day.\" After Patrick says this, everyone decides to celebrate National No Patrick Day and boards the bus except for Patrick, who is stopped by SpongeBob. The second everyone leaves, Patrick sadly wonders where they went, obviously forgetting what he just said as the episode closes.",

        "transcript": "[The episode starts at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is sleeping, and his alarm clock wakes him up, he struggles to turn it off, yawns, then gets out of bed, puts his pants on, then walks into the kitchen to get food for Gary, he accidentally trips because of the heavy bag of food, and there's a big pile of food on top of Gary's bowl.] SpongeBob: Gary, come and get it! [Gary doesn't come to get the food. Outside SpongeBob's pineapple, the wind is blowing and Bikini Bottom looks completely empty] Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary!? [SpongeBob looks in the living room, at the top of the staircase, out of a door at the bottom of the staircase, under his bed, and in the toilet, SpongeBob then walks back into the kitchen] Gary must have gotten an early start. [walks away] [The scene cuts to outside where SpongeBob is walking up to Squidward's house with a megaphone.] SpongeBob: Rise and shine, Squidward! You don't wanna be late again. [silence] Okay, see you at the Krusty Krab. [now talking to himself] I guess Squidward needs his beauty sleep. Not everyone is blessed with my natural good looks. [The scene cuts to Patrick's house. SpongeBob knocks on it.] SpongeBob: Patrick, it's morning! You don't want to forget to wake up again. [silence again] Patrick? Okay, see you after work, sleepy head. [Cut to scene of SpongeBob walking on the street whistling, where nobody else is. SpongeBob hops over a boat that is in the middle of the road, then walks in the Krusty Krab, and stares out the order window. The sun is setting, and SpongeBob looks at his watch.] SpongeBob: Slow day. Good night, Squidward. Good night, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs' office door opens, revealing that Mr. Krabs is not there] [Cut back to SpongeBob's house.] SpongeBob: Gary, I'm home! Gary? You here, buddy? [walks into the kitchen, realizing that the big pile of food is still there] Gary? [gasps] He hasn't touched his food! [runs over to Squidward's house screaming, and then knocks on the door] Squidward! Open up! [door opens by itself] Squidward, have you seen Gary? He's gone missing! [no answer] Squidward? Not a sign of Squidward anywhere. Squidward? [walks upstairs] You up here? Hmm, Squidward's clarinet. [puts the clarinet in his mouth a few times] It's not even warm. Squidward's missing, too! [runs over to Patrick's house] Patrick, open up! Squidward and Gary are missing! [lifts up rock, revealing that there's nobody there] Patrick's gone, too. What if everybody's gone?! [cuts to the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs! [gasp] He's gone, too! [cuts to Sandy's house] Sandy! She's gone. [Cut to SpongeBob walking out of five buildings, saying \"Gone\" each time he exits one. He then runs forward on the street, hyperventilating.] SpongeBob: Where did everybody go?! [wide shot of Bikini Bottom, where SpongeBob's voice echoes off a cliff] Everybody's gone! But I swear that I will keep the memory of Bikini Bottom alive, by living out their lives for them. [Cut to the next day, where SpongeBob is blowing a bubble of himself, then plays a record of him laughing. He then runs into Squidward's house, takes the form of Squidward, and imitates him.] SpongeBob: [imitating Squidward] SpongeBob, will you be quiet? You're disrupting my genius. [plays off-key notes on Squidward's clarinet. Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs, sir, can I have a raise? [SpongeBob then sits in Mr. Krabs' chair and takes the form of Mr. Krabs and imitates him] No! Now get to work! [as SpongeBob] Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir! [Bubble transition to SpongeBob taking the form of Old Man Jenkins and imitating him.] SpongeBob: [imitating Old Man Jenkins] Excuse me, sonny, may I have a Krabby Patty Deluxe please? [as Squidward, with normal voice] Right away, sir! [imitates Squidward] I mean... whatever. [sticks head in the kitchen] Hey, SpongeBob, we got an order for a Krabby Patty Deluxe. Heaven knows why. [giggles, then moves a box that looks like him] Coming up, Squidward! [Bubble transition to SpongeBob at Patrick's house where he is sleeping and snoring in Patrick's form. Bubble transition to Sandy's house.] SpongeBob: Excuse me, Sandy, but may I have some more of this delicious iced tea? [as Sandy] Why, sure! Whoops, just a sec. [grows a tail] Why sure now, SpongeBob. [Bubble transition to Mrs. Puff's Boating School, with SpongeBob as Mrs. Puff.] SpongeBob: [imitating Mrs. Puff] Good morning, class. Can anyone tell me the first thing you do when riding a boat? [as himself] Ahem, floor it? [as Mrs. Puff] That's right, you floor it. Excellent work, SpongeBob! [as himself] Why thank you, Mrs.... [sadly] Pu... Pu... Puff! [starts to cry] This is pointless! I'm no Mrs. Puff! I can't replace everyone! I'll never be happy again! [notices a stack of blank driver's licenses on the desk] Ooh, my driver's license! [Cut to SpongeBob, taking a picture of him to put in the license.] SpongeBob: That's the baby. [he then walks up to a boat] Hi, fella, it's me. [boat drives away, SpongeBob then pulls it back up] It's okay, I'm licensed. [SpongeBob gets in the boat and starts it up] Oh yeah, listen to that purr! La-la-la- [SpongeBob starts driving it around Bikini Bottom causing destruction] -la-la-la... [SpongeBob falls asleep and drives into Patrick's house, causing it to skid up, missing Squidward's house, and then crashes into the top floor of SpongeBob's house.] SpongeBob: [in bed] Good night, Boaty. [Cut to SpongeBob having nightmares and talking in his sleep.] SpongeBob: No. No! [wakes up and screams] No! [pants] Oh, Gary, I had a nightmare that all my friends were gone! And I was driving a-! [screams and notices that Boaty is right next to him in bed] So it was true! I... guess it's just you and me now, Boaty. [Scene cuts to him and Boaty taking a shower, then eating cereal, then crashing out of the pineapple riding it, then jellyfishing, then at the Goo Lagoon, then on the seesaw, then driving into the Krusty Krab.] SpongeBob: This is where I work. Do you want to help me cook up some Krabby Patties? [silence] Great! [puts a box of Krabby Patties under Boaty's tire, then moving it to get the patties on the grill] Back when everyone was around, they used to enjoy these. Here, try one. [throws a Krabby Patty under his hood, it then splatters everywhere] What? You don't like Krabby Patties? Huh! Well, I guess we can still make this work. [Scene cuts to SpongeBob driving Boaty into the pineapple.] SpongeBob: Whew. Boy, we learned a lot about each other today. You know? I thought I'd go crazy without all my friends and acquaintances around, but it looks like you were all I needed to stay sane! [Boaty rumbles] What? A puppet of my old best friend? [Boaty rumbles again] Made entirely out of Krabby Patty meat? [laughs] Oh, Boaty, you are a card. [walks into a closet, where he is talking to the puppet Boaty was talking about earlier] Sorry I'm late, Patrick. Boaty was telling me a joke. [SpongeBob sticks his hand in there and starts talking for him] Krabby Patty Patrick: You're awfully chummy with that guy for someone who has it out for you. SpongeBob: Who, Boaty? [giggles] Oh no. He's... Really? Krabby Patty Patrick: I can't talk now. He's watching us. SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick! Don't go! [notices Boaty is staring at him] Huh? Nothing! Boaty! I... I'm just going to bed. French Narrator: Three days later... SpongeBob: [writing in his diary] Dear diary, not sure if I can trust any vehicle. Run for it as soon as the coast is clear. [SpongeBob looks out of the plant he's hiding in, seeing there's no one there, walks into a closet, where Boaty comes in, SpongeBob screams and bursts through the wall of his house. He runs into another boat and screams] [runs into a boat rental and screams] [SpongeBob runs inside The Reef theater. Cut to inside one of the theater rooms, where SpongeBob looks around to make sure there is no Boaty. He pulls up some popcorn and turns to the screen, a movie about vehicles is being shown, and screams. SpongeBob runs out of the theater, and he grabs an ax and looks for Boaty. He sees a bus coming toward him and strikes at it with his ax. The bus stops, and everyone in Bikini Bottom steps out.] SpongeBob: Huh? Mr. Krabs: Sheesh. Calm down, boy. SpongeBob: You're all still alive? Well, where did you go? Mr. Krabs: It was National No SpongeBob Day. SpongeBob: National No SpongeBob Day? Mr. Krabs: Yeah. A whole day dedicated to getting away from you. SpongeBob: A day? But you guys have been gone for weeks. Mr. Krabs: Uhh... heh heh, yeah well... we kinda milked it a little. [Patrick comes out of the bus with balloons and a T-shirt with SpongeBob crossed out on it.] SpongeBob: You too, Patrick? Patrick: Yeah. Everyone needs at least one day away from... [imitates SpongeBob's laugh] SpongeBob: [sadly] Well, I'm... glad you had fun. [sobs] Mr. Krabs: Aww, cheer up, boy. It's a whole day inspired by you. SpongeBob: Really? Mr. Krabs: Of course. [cut to a flashback of everyone in Bikini Bottom except SpongeBob around a SpongeBob made of wood] First, we built a giant wooden effigy of you, then we burned it to the ground. [the citizens burn it] Whoo-hoo! Burn, baby! [cut to everyone dancing on the ashes of the effigy] And danced on the ashes like there was no tomorrow. [flashback ends] SpongeBob: Wow. A whole day dedicated to me. [blushes] Patrick: Big deal. Wait 'til you see \"No Patrick Day.\" Come on, everyone. Let's go! [Everyone gets on the bus. SpongeBob knocks Patrick off when he tries to get on. Patrick immediately forgets what happened.] Patrick: Where'd everybody go? Hello? Hello? [looks around]",

        "synopsis": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob is brushing Gary, when he suddenly hears a strange noise. He goes outside to investigate, only to find out that it is just Squidward breathing. Squidward then tells SpongeBob that he will pay him five dollars if he gives him peace and quiet for the rest of the day. However, Squidward already gave SpongeBob five dollars to leave him alone yesterday. He gets annoyed, so Squidward begins walking away. He then finds out that SpongeBob is following him, so he starts running and he jumps onto his boat. However, he cannot find the keys and then SpongeBob arrives at Squidward's boat. Squidward then becomes furious, only to find out that SpongeBob wanted to give him his keys. Squidward drives away and literally drives through a stop sign by accident. He gets pulled over by a police man, telling him that he needs to go to boating school to get his boating record clean.After that, the scene changes to Squidward walking up to Mrs. Puff's Boating School, and once he opens the door, he sees SpongeBob and then starts to cry. During class, Squidward is forced to sit next to SpongeBob. Then Mrs. Puff asks Squidward why he is enrolled in Boating School, so he tells everyone in the class while SpongeBob heavily breathes during this, annoying Squidward. After, Mrs. Puff tells SpongeBob to illustrate his side of the story, but SpongeBob just draws a picture with him and Squidward saying \"SpongeBob and Squidward, Best Boating Buddies Forever\" on the chalkboard, much to the confusion of the students and to Squidward's annoyance.Later, during lunchtime, Squidward tries to avoid SpongeBob. He then decides to eat in the bathroom, but he sees \"SpongeBob's\" feet. Furious, Squidward angrily throws his sandwich on the floor, bangs the door and yells at \"SpongeBob\", but when it opens, it is revealed to not be SpongeBob, but rather, a tough guy. Squidward awkwardly freaks out that he thought it was SpongeBob and gets beaten up, offscreen. He arrives back in class with SpongeBob, and Mrs. Puff tells him that he has to drive with SpongeBob for a test. So, they get inside a boat and SpongeBob is the driver. However, he drives out of control and crashes into a research lab. There, he, Squidward, and Mrs. Puff shrink and get washed down the drain. SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff end up in a water fountain back at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, while Squidward ends up in the bathroom and gets beaten up again.The scene changes to everyone back in class. Mrs. Puff explains that everyone is going to do a test. But when SpongeBob tries to help him, an angry Squidward snaps at him exclaiming that they are not \"Boating Buddies,\" and he never wants help from him ever again. SpongeBob's feelings are hurt. However, Squidward cannot do the test because he cannot pick up the pencil since it is all bandaged up, so he asks for SpongeBob's help; when the sponge reminds him of what he said, Squidward denies it, only for his voice to have been recorded by another student. Finally, when Squidward admits that he and SpongeBob are \"Boating Buddies,\" and stated he said that before they became \"Boating Buddies\" and SpongeBob cheers. But time runs out and Squidward asks Mrs. Puff what to do. She then says that he needs to come back the next week to retake the test. Squidward finds out that SpongeBob also failed the test, and he has to come back the next week too, causing Squidward to scream, ending the episode.",

        "transcript": "[The episode starts at SpongeBob's house. Inside, SpongeBob is brushing Gary's shell.] SpongeBob: 97, 98, 99, 100. Okay, Gary, let's do the other side now. Gary, can you hear that? [Gary is confused, then SpongeBob walks outside, and over to Squidward] Oh, Squidward, it's you. I thought I heard something. Squidward: SpongeBob, I've been sitting here motionless for 45 minutes. What could you possibly have heard me doing? SpongeBob: Breathing. Squidward: SpongeBob, I will give you $5 if you let me enjoy the rest of my morning, in peace. SpongeBob: [half of his head flips open while he talks] Okay! [Squidward takes out his wallet] Squidward: Hey, I could have sworn I had $5 in here. SpongeBob: I have it, Squidward, you gave it to me to leave you alone yesterday. [Squidward gets up] Squidward, you can have the $5 back. Mr. Krabs says-- Squidward: I don't care what Mr. Krabs says! I just want-- [bangs on the table, and the liquid in his cup spills on him] SpongeBob: Coffee rain! Squidward: It's hot chocolate. [walks away] SpongeBob: Chocolate rain! [Squidward is still walking] Squidward! [Squidward runs screaming] Squidward, wait! [scene then shows both of them running for a while, then Squidward gets to his boat. Tries to open it but can't.] Squidward: It's locked! SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward! [Squidward screams, then jumps in the boat, then tries to start it but it won't start] Squidward: Huh? [realizes the key isn't there] The key! Oh, where did I put that stupid... SpongeBob: [as he is yelling, Squidward is searching] Squidward! Squidward! Squidward: Oh, why can't I just find that-? [SpongeBob makes it to the boat] SpongeBob: Squidward? Squidward: [yells in SpongeBob's face as usual] What?! SpongeBob: You left your keys on the table back there. [Squidward starts the boat] Hey, Squidward? Squidward: Yes? SpongeBob: Didn't you used to have one of those cucumber bicycles? Squidward: Oh. [laughs] That was a recumbent bicycle, and I sold it. SpongeBob: Why? Squidward: So I could get further away from you! [rushes off and drives away laughing. Pebbles are flying onto SpongeBob's face. SpongeBob is now entirely covered in pebbles and lifts his right arm to wave goodbye to Squidward.] SpongeBob: Okay, I'll see you later then, Squidward. Squidward: Bon voyage, nincompoop! [as he looks back on SpongeBob, he drives through a stop sign, and then sees in the rearview mirror that he's being followed by a police car] What the? [pulls over, then the policeman walks up] Can I help you, officer? Policeman: [the stop sign Squidward crashed into is on his head] No, but you can help yourself to this ticket. Squidward: [gasps] Ticket? Officer, please! I have impeccable boat smarts! I pride myself in obtaining an un-soiled driving record! It's all that I have! Policeman: Well, you can have it again, right after you complete boating school. [drives off] Squidward: Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo...? [Bubble transition to Mrs. Puff's boating school, where Squidward is walking] Squidward: Boating school. Blegh. [knocks on door] Oh, well, it's just one day out of your life, Squiddy. How bad can it be? [SpongeBob opens the door] SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward! [Squidward cries, then the bell rings] Mrs. Puff: Good morning, class. Would everyone please take a seat? [SpongeBob sits] SpongeBob: Psst. Squidward, sit here. Here. Squidward: Um, excuse me, there doesn't seem to be any empty seats left. Mrs. Puff: But there's one right next to SpongeBob. [Squidward sits down. SpongeBob touches Squidward] Squidward: Do you mind? SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. We're boating buddies now! I'll teach you everything I know, and then we can- Squidward: \"We\" won't be doing anything, because there is no we ! Understand? Mrs. Puff: Quiet in the front, please. SpongeBob: Oh, I understand. I understand perfectly, [winks at Squiward] boating buddy. Mrs. Puff: Okay class, how about we get to know our new students, by telling each other why we were sentenced to- I mean why we are enrolled in boating school. Student: Um, I got caught speeding. Mrs. Puff: Very good. Next. Student: I don't see what's so very good about it. Mrs. Puff: No, I didn't mean very... Student: [sighs] I know exactly what you meant. Mrs. Puff: Next. SpongeBob: I am here because I- Mrs. Puff: We all know why you're here, SpongeBob. What about you, sir? [referring to Squidward] Squidward: Me? Mrs. Puff: Yes. Would you like to tell the rest of the class, why you're with us today? Squidward: Why I'm- [notices SpongeBob is staring at him while breathing heavily] All right, I'll tell you. I was trying to get away....from him! [SpongeBob continues breathing] He is the bane of my existence! Mrs. Puff: Yours too? Uhh... what I meant to say was, please come up to the chalkboard and draw a diagram of the incident. Squidward: Gladly. [begins drawing what he is saying] It all started when I left my house. [adds some dots to the drawing of his house] And then, he appeared. [frustratedly makes a drawing of SpongeBob] He made an immediate right turn and parked here. [referring to Squidward's house] Seeing the oncoming hazard, I looked both ways and proceeded safely toward my vehicle. It was then, that I realized that I was being followed at an unsafe distance. So, in order to create more optimal driving conditions, I was forced to then par-take in [screeches the chalk board] evasive action. And by increasing speed slightly, I created a safety cushion, while inadvertently attracting the attention of said law enforcement official. May I sit down now, sweet cheeks? Mrs. Puff: Why, certainly. And perhaps now, SpongeBob would like to come up and illustrate his side of the story. Squidward: His side?! SpongeBob: Well, first, I started over here. And then I went wayyyyyyy over here. Do-do-do-do, like that. Then, I went around like this, and over here like that, and across this lane, and down here like this, and then... [continues writing, without SpongeBob's speaking being heard as Vivaldi's \"The Four Seasons\" plays in the background] ...and then I went around and stopped right here. Everyone: [reading the blackboard] “SpongeBob and Squidward, best boating buddies, forever”? [all are confused, then SpongeBob sits down] SpongeBob: Do you like it, Squidward? Squidward: Shut it. [the bell rings] [Bubble transition to everyone eating lunch. SpongeBob, holding a lunch tray with a hot dog and grape juice, is sitting next to Squidward, who is eating a sandwich.] SpongeBob: Ah, lunch time, eh, boating buddy? [sits down while Squidward walks away, over to the trash cans] Squidward: I'll have to eat over here, like in grade school. [is about to eat, then SpongeBob pops up from a trash can] SpongeBob: Squidward, do you have any mustard in there? [Squidward runs away screaming] [Bubble transition to the bathroom, where Squidward is eating the sandwich.] Squidward: Mmm, Bon appétit, Squiddy. [is about to eat, but then hears a flush. He then sees what appears to be SpongeBob's feet in the other stall. Squidward growls angrily, walks out of the bathroom stall, and throws his sandwich on the ground. He then starts pounding his fist on the door of the stall thinking that SpongeBob was seen in.] You've ruined my morning, you've ruined my lunch, and you're ruining my... [door opens, revealing that it's a muscular tough fish reading \"The Daily Chronical\" newspaper, with feet that look like SpongeBob's. Squidward freaks out as the muscular fish comes right at him. The scene cuts to Squidward walking to his seat, bandaged up.] Mrs. Puff: Okay, class, it's time for our behind the wheel lesson. Squidward, you'll be riding with SpongeBob. Squidward: Eh, didn't see that coming. [Bubble transition to Mrs. Puff, Squidward, and SpongeBob in a boat at the starting line.] Mrs. Puff: Now, we're going to take this nice and slow. SpongeBob, what do we do when pulling away from the curb? SpongeBob: Uh, step on the gas? Mrs. Puff: Good. Nice and easy. Now let's slowly... [SpongeBob pushes the gas pedal too hard, and Mrs. Puff screams.] Squidward: SpongeBob, look out! [they bump through the cones, then they barge out through the fence, then they go through a red light, he then gives the wheel] SpongeBob, give me that wheel! SpongeBob: I got it, I got it. [they fight over it] Squidward: Don't... just let go of it! [the steering wheel breaks, and Mrs. Puff panics. They make a sharp right turn, barely missing grandma.] Grandma: Hooligans! [Mrs. Puff, Squidward, and SpongeBob scream as they drive through the Barg'N-Mart. The three, holding a turkey, a pair of carrots, and a milk carton, respectively, continue to scream as they ran into the Costume Supplies shop as the toaster oven times-up bell sounds. The three are now dressed up as a witch with an axe, a chef, and a gorilla, respectively. They then scream as they drive into the Top Secret Laboratory and Research Facility.] Scientist 1: Johnson, I finally figured out a way to shrink an ordinary mailman, down to the size of a grain of sand. Scientist 2: But how? Scientist 1: By using this shrink ray. [pulls a lever that turns it on, then the boat comes in, and they get shrunk instead] Scientist 2: Mother of mercy! [they shrink] Where'd they go? Scientist 1: There! They're heading right for that discarded potato chip. [the mailman growls] Scientist 2: What's the matter? Scientist 1: Potato chips are his favorite snack. [The mailman breaks out] Scientist 1: Johnson! No! [The mailman takes the chip and is about to eat it, but then gets sprayed with water by the second scientist.] Scientist 2: No, no, no. [The chip drops on the floor and breaks in half, then Mrs. Puff, SpongeBob, and Squidward make a break for it into a drain. The scene then cuts to a cowboy heading to a water drinking fountain, but as he starts drinking out of it, Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob come out of it and return to their normal sizes.] Cowboy: I never will understand these city folk. SpongeBob: Hey, where'd Squidward go? [The scene cuts to the tough fish from earlier whistling while entering a bathroom stall, locking the lock until he hears Squidward returning to normal size in the toilet, making the fish furious at him.] Squidward: [nervously sweating] I was just leaving. [The scene cuts to SpongeBob back in the classroom until he hears and see Squidward enter the room all bandaged up with crutches.] Mrs. Puff: Okay class, it's time to take our final exam. Please have your pencils ready. SpongeBob: Pst, hey, boating buddy? [Squidward looks at him] If you need any help, I've taken this test hundreds of times... [Squidward cuts him off] Squidward: [furious] How many times do I have to tell you?! I am not your buddy! I don't need your help, [close-up of his face] and I don't need you! Ever! Now, just kindly let me take this stupid test, so I can get out of here and never have to see you again for the rest of my life! SpongeBob: [sadly] Okay, Squidward, if that's the way you want it. Squidward: Thank you. [tries to pick up his pencil, then picks it up in both hands, but then it drops and rolls out the room] Mrs. Puff: 3 more minutes, class. Squidward: SpongeBob? SpongeBob, I need your help. Mrs. Puff: 2 more minutes. Squidward: SpongeBob, please? This is important. SpongeBob: You said you didn't need my help, Squidward, and that you didn't need me. Squidward: No, no, I didn't. I never said that. [a student plays back what Squidward said] I don't need your help, and I don't need you! [now talking] Jerk. [the student shrugs] All right, I said it. But that was before. SpongeBob: Before what? Squidward: [nervously] Before-- before-- Mrs. Puff: 1 more minute, class. Squidward: Before we were... [gulps] boating buddies. SpongeBob: Yay! Mrs. Puff: Okay, class, time's up. Squidward: Time can't be up! I didn't even get a chance to fill in a single answer! What am I supposed to do? Mrs. Puff: You do the same thing that everybody else does who failed the test. You take it again next week. Squidward: Next week? SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I've never gotten one answer right on this test. But we'll meet again next week, at Mrs. Puff's Boating School! [The scene cuts to the camera zooming out from the exterior of the boating school. Squidward screams as the episode ends.]",

        "synopsis": "After watching an episode of The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, SpongeBob and Patrick see a commercial for the new book saying that Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy will be signing the book starting at 8 o'clock. SpongeBob is unhappy due to the fact that he has to go to boating school. Patrick suggests calling in sick, but SpongeBob does not want his perfect attendance record to end. They then decide that SpongeBob will wait until he has to go to the bathroom, and then sneak to the comic book store when Mrs. Puff gives him the bathroom key.The next day in boating school, SpongeBob has to go to the bathroom. Mrs. Puff gives him the bathroom key and tells him to return it to her desk, and with that, SpongeBob exits the school. He and Patrick get to the store and get their books signed and walk through Jellyfish Fields. The jellyfish start to lift up Patrick and let him sit on them, with Patrick stating they are \"friendly.\" They then throw themselves into SpongeBob's net, then leave. SpongeBob and Patrick continue ending up buying ice cream. Incidental 49 congratulates SpongeBob on being her 100th customer and tells him he can come back for free ice cream anytime.The two pursuit into Goo Lagoon where they get into a Badminton match with Sandy and a friend named Dale. SpongeBob and Patrick end Sandy's unbeatable streak and are convinced by their fans to play another round. The cops come and arrest Dale, who is an ex-con on probation, for eating gummy fish. A fish tells SpongeBob that he and Dale were classmates back at Boating School and he was a nice guy until he started cutting class and ever since then, he became a criminal. With this, SpongeBob, who fears that he will meet the same fate as Dale if he kept ditching class, started to head back to school.SpongeBob has to race through the Bikini Bottom hug fest where a woman grabs him. He forces her to let go and continues. He ends up in a pit of tar and starts to drown, remembering the last words that Mrs. Puff said to him. Realizing he never returned the bathroom key, SpongeBob then fights his way out with a crowd cheering him on. He makes it back to the school with Mrs. Puff at the door and she becomes infuriated. He explains what he did, with her not knowing what he is talking about and does not have time for it since she has her own problems. The police are arresting her for ditching jury duty. The car pulls off with her telling SpongeBob to never ditch. SpongeBob adheres and says he will never ditch again, leaving her furious and confused with him wondering what \"again\" meant.",

Our molecular bubble is impenetrable! Man Ray: That's exactly what I was hoping for. [Laughs evilly] Mermaid Man: Whoa! [Man Ray knocks the two heroes over with the bubble] Man Ray: [Laughs evilly] Mermaid Man: Stop! [The heroes fire lasers at Man Ray, but miss him due to the bubble] Man Ray: [Laughs evilly] Thanks for making this easy. Till next time! [Laughs evilly, and floats away] Narrator: You just enjoyed another exciting episode of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Brought to you by... [cuts to a Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy comic book] ...the new Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy book! Patrick and SpongeBob: [hug each other and gasp] Narrator: For the first time, we learn about these legendary superheroes' origins, and their rise to stardom. Tomorrow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy will appear in the flesh signing their new books! [Patrick and SpongeBob bite their nails, and speak gibberish] Narrator: Don't delay! Arrive early to make sure you get your copy signed! Doors open at 8 a.m. Patrick: Oh, boy! We're gonna get our books signed and then we're gonna meet Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and then we're gonna shake their hands and then they're gonna sign our books! SpongeBob: There's only one problem! ...I can't. Patrick: What do you mean? [Drops SpongeBob] SpongeBob: I'll be in boating school at 8 a.m. tomorrow. Patrick: Oh, well, can't you just skip a day? Just call in sick. Always worked for Squidward. SpongeBob: And tarnish my reputation of never missing one day of school? I couldn't. Besides, that would be lying. And lying is wrong. Patrick: Okay. Hmm... oh, I know! What are those things you use when... after you eat, you need to take a... SpongeBob: Oh! Take a... take a bathroom break! Patrick: That's the one! Why don't you take a bathroom break tomorrow, sneak out the window, get your book signed, and sneak back into class! It wouldn't take long at all! SpongeBob: But what if I don't need to use the bathroom? Patrick: Oh! There's always the catch. [Speaks gibberish, and walks into the kitchen] I need brain fuel! Ah! SpongeBob, how am I gonna feed my brain when all you have is your fancy bubbly water? Well, it'll have to do. [Takes a bottle, and chugs it down, takes two other bottles] SpongeBob: Patrick, is this really neces— Patrick: —sary?! Yes, it is! [Drinks the two bottles he took, camera cuts to Patrick's insides, and shows the water filling up his body as he drinks] SpongeBob: Patrick? Patrick: Yeah? SpongeBob: You feeling all right? Patrick: [Turns to see he is completely fattened] Uh-huh. [Burps] Why? SpongeBob: Nothing. Nothing. [Light bulb pops by his head] That's it! Patrick: What? [Burps] SpongeBob: I won't go to the bathroom ‘til tomorrow. And when I have to go, I'll really have to... [changes position like he needs to go to the bathroom] ...go. [Laughs. Bubble transition to boating school] Mrs. Puff: Can anyone tell me what the hand signal is for a left turn? [Sees SpongeBob, who is groaning and holding his pee and even curling up his legs] Something the matter, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Nneee just a little... woo! Woo! I gotta, nnnnn, gotta go to the... Mrs. Puff: I'd say so. [Holds up the bathroom key] Here. [Close up to the bathroom key] SpongeBob: The bathroom key! Mrs. Puff: And make sure you return that bathroom key to my desk, or you're in big trouble, mister! SpongeBob: Nnnnn, thank you, Mrs. Puff. Nnnnn... [Squirms toward Mrs. Puff] Mrs. Puff: And hurry back! No dilly-dallying! SpongeBob: [Grabs the key] Thanks. Will do. Nnnnn... [Exits boating school.

Now I shall be the envy of the Superhero Fan Club! Ohhh... [walks away] Barnacle Boy: Next. Mermaid Man: Boy, I sure do like signing books. What's this for again? SpongeBob: Hi, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, will you sign our books? Barnacle Boy: Of course. [Takes books. Patrick and SpongeBob excitedly speak gibberish together] Barnacle Boy: There you go. Patrick and SpongeBob: Thank you! Barnacle Boy: Anytime, boys. Mermaid Man: And remember, stay on the path of evil! Barnacle Boy: It's stay away from the path of evil. Mermaid Man: Oh. Wh-what is evil? Barnacle Boy: Oh. [Speaks gibberish. Bubble transition to Jellyfish Fields] SpongeBob: Okay, that was fun. Well, I should really start heading back to class. Patrick: SpongeBob, look! [Cuts to a jellyfish] Let's go catch it! [Runs after the jellyfish] SpongeBob: But what about my class? Patrick: This is a shortcut. SpongeBob: Wait up! You don't even have a net! Patrick! [gasps, camera cuts to numerous jellyfish] Wow. Neptune's scepter, I don't believe this! Patrick: Pretty cool, huh? [Cuts to Patrick in midair] SpongeBob: How'd you do that? Patrick: I didn't do it. They did. [Camera pans out to show Patrick actually sitting on some jellyfish, pats one] They're friendly. SpongeBob: Wow! [Looks up, a jellyfish sees SpongeBob's net, smiles, and goes inside of it] Oh boy, you weren't kidding! [Laughs and runs along with Patrick. Camera cuts to SpongeBob catching one jellyfish, then two, then four] SpongeBob: [Shown having caught all the jellyfish] You're free to go, guys. [Jellyfish exit net. Bubble transition to the street] Patrick: [Stops SpongeBob] Ice cream! [Runs toward stand] SpongeBob: Oh, come on, I don't have time for this. Patrick: Yeah, four scoops. [Sadie scoops a final vanilla scoop onto Patrick's cone] SpongeBob: Patrick, have you forgotten I gotta go? Patrick: Oh don't be such a sourpuss. [Gets out a dollar and hands it to Sadie] Here, I'll buy you a cone. [Confetti falls] Sadie: [Uses a noise maker] Congratulations! You're my 100th customer! [Pulls down sheet saying '100TH CUSTOMER!'] From now on, you can come back and have all the free ice cream you want! SpongeBob: [Laughs. Bubble transition to Goo Lagoon] Patrick: [Picks up ice cream with his tooth, gulps it down, shivers, and lets out a breath of cold air] SpongeBob: [Slides ice cream into his mouth with his tongue, gulps it down, shivers, and lets out a breath of cold air] SpongeBob: [Eats cone along with Patrick] Well, this certainly has been a glorious day, but I better get back to class. Patrick: [Speaks muffledly] SpongeBob: Oh, you said it buddy. Sandy: Where do you think you're going, SquarePants? You just got here. SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Sandy, but I just gotta get back to class. Sandy: Sure you can't stay for just a short spell, SpongeBob? I mean, it's such a nice day, everyone's having a good time. Every Fish at Goo Lagoon: Hi, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: No! I gave Mrs. Puff my word, and I shall not betray her! Sandy: Not even for a game of badminton with me and Dale here? SpongeBob: Okay, maybe just one game. [Bubble transition to the badminton game] Sandy: I'm serving it up, SpongeBob! Ready or not! [Throws up birdie] SpongeBob: Patrick, you know how to play this game? Patrick: [shrugs] Sandy: [serves birdie] SpongeBob: Is this the one when the lowest score wins? [Sets racquet outward, birdie bounces off it, Sandy tries to save, but birdie lands right by her racquet] Sandy: Nice job SpongeBob, your serve! SpongeBob: Here it comes! [Throws up birdie, but cannot hit it with the racquet, falls, and ends up serving with his foot. Birdie flies past Sandy and Dale, and lands in the sand] SpongeBob: Hey, I'm getting pretty good at this game! Patrick: [Hits birdie] Sandy: [Spikes birdie down, and makes a hole in Patrick's head] SpongeBob: [squirms, the racquet hits the birdie and lands directly where Sandy and Dale's area started] Gus: He's about to beat the undefeated Sandy Cheeks at her own game! Crowd: SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [Continue chanting] SpongeBob: [serves birdie] Dale: [hits birdie back] SpongeBob: [Lightly hits birdie back] Sandy: [Hits birdie back] SpongeBob: [Screams, jumps in the air, and hits birdie. Sandy and Dale tried to hit it back, but almost barely succeed, the birdie landing in the sand] Crowd: Yay! SpongeBob: [Walking away] Well I better be off now. Crowd: No! Gus: Don't go SpongeBob, think about your fans! SpongeBob: Well if it's for the fans, well maybe I can play one game more. Orange police fish: [off-screen] Not today, yellow. Light teal police fish: You've been playing with a convicted felon, and we know he's violated his parole somehow. You might as well confess Dale. [A crowd begins to gather around the scene] Dale: Hey man, I haven't done nothing! Officer John: Oh yeah? What have you got in there? [Police pulls out candy from Dale's shirt pocket] Quasi-Gummy Chewy Candy Fish. Is this how you have fun? By eating your own kind? Scum like you make me sick. Cuff him! [Another police fish approaches Dale and clutches handcuffs around Dale's wrists, which are now behind his back. Dale is escorted away from the scene] Gus: That's a shame what happened to Dale. We were classmates back in boating school. He used to be a good student, until he started cutting class. Ever since then, he's led the lonely life of a criminal. SpongeBob: C-c-c-c... [pulls his bottom eyelids down] ...criminal!? [A woman's scream is heard off-screen in horror of this. Lets go of eyelids] I gotta go back to class! [Runs in circles, and runs away upside down] I can't be a ditcher! [Runs into volleyball game, is accidentally involved as the volleyball, ends up in the road and is run over by an old roller blader, he struggles to find his body, until only his legs are missing, he sees his legs running, pants to catch up with them and jumps into them] Almost there. Just have to get past the... [skids to a halt] ...Bikini Bottom Hug Fest? Sadie: Aww... does someone need a hug? SpongeBob: No, no, no, no... Sadie: [Hugs SpongeBob] Don't fight the love, kid. SpongeBob: Miss, if you don't let me go right now, I might have to turn into a criminal! [Squeezes out of Sadie's grip, and rolls away] Whaaa! Sadie: [gasps] That sounded like a threat! Harold: I am so sorry. [Hugs Sadie as she may begin weeping. Cut to SpongeBob, still rolling] SpongeBob: [speaks gibberish, and falls off a cliff] Whoa! [lands in blue gunk, camera pans out to show surroundings, as well as the sign to show where he is] The tar pits? [sinks] Ah! I'm sinking! [spits out tar] Well, I guess this is the end, SquarePants. But like the old saying goes, \"Better to end up sinking into a prehistoric lake of tar, then to turn to a life of crime!\" Goodbye, world. Goodbye, Mrs. Puff. I'll always cherish those last kind words that you said to me. [thinks] Mrs. Puff: Make sure you return that bathroom key to my desk or you're in big trouble mister! SpongeBob: [sinks all the way in. Camera stays at tar pits for a while, before SpongeBob's tar-covered hand pops up with the bathroom key, also covered in tar] SpongeBob: [walks up from the tar, losing the tar from where he pops up] Ohh I never returned Mrs. Puff's bathroom key! I can't give up now! Crowd: SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob: [pulls onto a prehistoric animal's tusk, and is flung face-first into the wall. Camera cuts to cliff, which SpongeBob climbs] SpongeBob: [Runs for boating school] I made it! And a minute before the final bell. I am home free. [Tries walking through the door, but ends up running into Mrs. Puff] Mrs. Puff... I'm really sorry! Please forgive me! I don't know what happened! Everything just got away from me! [Holds up bathroom key] I brought back your bathroom key, though! Mrs. Puff: I haven't the foggiest idea of what you're carrying on about SpongeBob, but I don't have time for it. I've got my own problems. [Two police officers show up behind her, and cuff her] Johnny Law finally caught up to me for ditching jury duty. Let this be a lesson to you, son...never ditch! SpongeBob: Okay Mrs. Puff, I'll never ditch again! Mrs. Puff: That's a good boy, SpongeBob. Good... Again?! What do you mean, again?!? [Bus drives away]",

        "synopsis": "The episode begins with SpongeBob thinking everyone is welcoming him to Mrs. Puff's Boating School, but it turns out the son of Tony Fast has enrolled in the school. All of the students were crowding around asking for his autograph. Mrs. Puff tells them that he shall receive no special attention. Right after that, she asked him for his autograph. Tony Fast Jr. is shown to be excellent at driving, which gives Mrs. Puff the idea to have him teach SpongeBob how to drive. During the test, Tony Fast Jr. explains to SpongeBob that he should relax, and this advice allows SpongeBob to drive better. He softens his foot on the gas pedal and goes around a corner. He successfully finishes the course and Mrs. Puff is relieved that she may not have to deal with him for much longer.Tony Jr. is walking on the boardwalk when SpongeBob comes up to him because he is eager to learn more from him. Tony states that he won't be able to teach him at the Boating School, but invites him to his home so he can learn. SpongeBob is at the gates of the Fast family's house and presses the button on the speaker. He is let in and Tony is on a unicycle. Both of his parents aren't home so Tony offers to show him his father's vintage speedboat collection. SpongeBob is amazed by all of the shiny speedboats and Tony asks him to pick his favorite. He chooses a flaming red speedboat and Tony asks if he wants to go for a ride in it.SpongeBob is driving the boat as Tony is on a hang glider that is attached to the boat. SpongeBob is nervous about driving and Tony tries to keep him calm so he doesn't crash again. He almost runs over a fish as his nerves start kicking in. He lets go of the steering wheel as Tony tells him to go faster. He lets go of the brakes and they go even faster. SpongeBob spots a red light and immediately stops the boat. Three fish are in a speedboat right next to them as they challenge them to a race. SpongeBob checks his schedule for any conflicts, and then accepts the challenge. However, after considering safety concerns he decides to decline the challenge. Tony Jr. is frustrated and calls it an embarrassment if they don't accept the challenge. Both race teams get ready as the traffic light changes to green. They take off throughout the town and SpongeBob starts gaining the lead. He presses harder on the gas pedal to get past his opponent again and the boat catches in flames as they pass Larry the Lobster. Larry catches the flames and gets an instant tan. Their opponents quickly slow down when they notice police nearby. SpongeBob is still going fast as they pass the police and they start after them.SpongeBob is freaking out and is unsure what to do as the sirens make it so Tony Jr. can't hear him. A police helicopter starts following them as well. Tony Fast Sr. is in his speedboat listening to the radio as a news story about the car chase comes on. The chase goes right by him and he starts chasing after SpongeBob and Tony Jr. He is angry as SpongeBob and Tony Jr. are clueless as to what they should do. Tony Jr. tries to calm SpongeBob once again and he declines his advice this time due to where it has gotten them. He drives through the sign of the Boating school and runs into Mrs. Puff as she inflates. Back in the classroom, Mrs. Puff is in a wheelchair and informs the class that Tony Jr. is no longer with them, and was transferred to another school. She also says that SpongeBob should never be let to drive, as the episode ends.",

Going on down to Boating School! Rea-de-de-la Mrs. Puff!♪ [stops and notices a crowd cheering] For me? Well on behalf on yours truly, I would like to thank each of you for such a wonderful and warm welcome. [walks over and shakes a female fish's fin] Thank you. [walks over to Sandals and shakes his fin] Thank you, sir. Sandals: What'd I do? SpongeBob: [bumps into Mrs. Puff] Mrs. Puff, thank you most of all! [about to kiss Mrs. Puff's fin, but she pulls it away] Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, that warm welcome wasn't for you. SpongeBob: It wasn't? Mrs. Puff: No! SpongeBob: Well then, who was it for? Shubie: It's for him! [The crowd cheers as a green raceboat with the number 1 pulls up in front of the Driving School. A pit crew quickly changes its tires and smokes from the engines fog up then clear up revealing a fish with sunglasses, a hat, and a mustache] SpongeBob: [gasps] It's Tony Fast! The famous race boat driver! [camera points down to a smaller fish beside Tony Fast] And his first born son, Tony Fast Jr.! Mable-Monica: I can't believe it's him! Oh... [falls onto a random fish's arms] SpongeBob: I can't believe that I'm in the presence of such big celebrities. Tony Fast: [pats Tony Jr.'s shoulder] Good luck on your first day of school son! Tony Jr.: Yeah, whatever. Tony Fast: Don't show off too much! [chuckles] Show off and just enough! [Tony Fast drives away on his raceboat causing smoke to fill the air to which the crowd coughs but then cheers and gathers around Tony Jr.] Harold: Hey! Tony Jr., [takes out a lunch box] wanna sign my lunch box? Sandles: [takes out a steering wheel] You wanna sign my steering wheel? Shubie: Wanna sign my... Harold: Hey! I was here first! Shubie: No, you weren't! I was! Mrs. Puff: [blows on whistle panting and sweating and taking a deep breath, then coughs] Ahem! While Tony Jr. is a student here, he will receive no special attention! He will be treated just like the rest of us! No exceptions! Now, Tony, report to the obstacle course where I will access your abilities! Tony Jr.: Sure thing, Teach! [walks over] Mrs. Puff: Hold it! [takes out a lunch box] Not until you've signed my lunchbox! [laughs] Crowd: [cuts to next scene] Go, Tony Jr., Go! Go, Tony Jr., Go! [Tony Jr. drives by them] Yay! Tony Jr.: [driving] Looks like it's my turn! [turns though a zig-zag like road] What goes around comes around! [drives around a giant anchor] Over and out! [drives up a hill-like road then back down and to the finish] Crowd: Hooray! Mrs. Puff: [thinking] He is good... Gasp! If he's really that good, maybe there's a chance, just a chance, some of that good could rub off my incorrigible student, SpongeBob SquarePants! [chuckles and out of thoughts] Yes! SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: Yes, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: What does \"incorrigible\" mean? [cuts to Tony Jr. in the boat with SpongeBob] Tony Jr.: So, you just want me to ride around with this dude for awhile? Mrs. Puff: That's it. Tony Jr.: Whatever... Let's roll! SpongeBob: It's nice to finally meet you Tony Fast Jr! [pants happily] Tony Jr.: I said let's roll! SpongeBob: [sweating frantically] Okay! Uh, roll? Roll!? Roll!? Is there a button for that? [starts pushing random button on the front of the boat] I know I know this! It's around here somewhere! I- Tony Jr.: Just drive! SpongeBob: Just driving! [slams down on the gas pedal driving quickly in which both SpongeBob and Tony Jr. scream as SpongeBob tries to drive the boat] W-w-w-what do these dotted lines mean? Tony Jr.: Relax, man. You gotta relax. SpongeBob: Relax... relax? Mrs. Puff hasn't taught us that yet! Tony Jr.: No, I mean just relax man... SpongeBob: Okay... just relaxing... and... relaxing! Relaxing! So hard! [his eye lids shatter] Raw! I can't relax! Tony Jr.: No, no, no. Not like that. You just gotta let go. SpongeBob: Let go? Tony Jr.: Be... cool... SpongeBob: Be cool? Tony Jr.: Be... cool... SpongeBob: Be... cool... [softly has his foot on the gas pedal as he drives perfectly around the corner and around the anchor] Cool... [drives up and down the road hill and finishes the course] Tony Jr.: Not bad, dude, not bad. Suzy: Gasp! It's a miracle! Harold: [on his knees] Neptune be praised! Mrs. Puff: That went better than expected! Oh! If Tony Jr. can keep this up, then SpongeBob might even graduate and I'll be rid of him forever! Forever! [laughs] Forever! Tony Jr.: Okay Bro-Jangles! Catch you... [jumps and flips off of the boat landing perfectly on the ground] ...on the flipside! [snaps and then gets picked up by Mrs. Puff] What the? [Mrs. Puff kisses him on the cheek] [Cuts back to Tony Jr. walking on the boardwalk] Tony Jr.: [stops walking and notices SpongeBob] Yeah, what is it? Can't you see I'm walking here? SpongeBob: I can see that! And I'm eager to learn more from you! Tony Jr.: Eager? SpongeBob: Yeah! Tony Jr.: I can't teach you anything more at this square school, no offense, SquarePants. SpongeBob: None taken! Tony Jr.: Well, if you really wanna learn more, you can come by my house later! [walks off] SpongeBob: Oh! I'll be delighted to! [Cuts to SpongeBob outside of the gates of Tony Fast and Tony Jr.'s house] SpongeBob: [presses the button on the speaker] Tony Jr.: Who is it? SpongeBob: It's SpongeBob SquarePants! Tony Jr.: Who? SpongeBob: SpongeBob, SquarePants! [the gates open and Tony Jr. appears on a unicycle] Tony Fast Jr.! Tony Jr.: Guy from school! Come on in! SpongeBob: [inside the house] Nice place you got here, Tony Jr.! Tony Jr.: Thanks! Lived here all my life! My mom and dad are out. SpongeBob: Oh! Uh, what does that mean? Tony Jr.: It means... you wanna see my dad's vintage speedboat collection? SpongeBob: Oh, would I? [cuts to Tony Fast's gararge showing many speedboats] Tony Jr.: And he took first place in this beauty surpassing speed records held by both Francis Baconskin Jr. and Smitty Tailpipe Rockama! SpongeBob: Wow! They're so shiny! Tony Jr.: Pick your favorite! SpongeBob: My favorite? Oh, I couldn't! Tony Jr.: Why, sure you can! What's the big- SpongeBob: [points to a red speedboat with flames on the front and with the number 8 on it] This one! Tony Jr.: Huh? The Batonia Classic! Excellent choice! [grabs the keys to the Batonia Classic] Want to take her for a spin? SpongeBob: A spin? But we don't even have boating licenses! Tony Jr.: [in the speedboat] You don't need a boating license for a raceboat, SquarePants! [Bubble transition to SpongeBob driving the Batonia Classic] SpongeBob: Wow, Tony Jr.! She handles like a dream! It's like I'm floating air! Tony Jr.: [on a hanglider flying as a rope is keeping him tied to the speedboat] You're telling me! SpongeBob: Are you sure you're comfortable with me driving, though? I admit I'm feeling a little nervous... Tony Jr.: I wouldn't if I were you! Remember, it was your nerves that made us almost crash before! SpongeBob: Hah... my nerves! I almost forgot about... my nerves! [starts driving nervously almost running over a fish] Sorry sir! Tony Jr.: Just let go! [lets go of the hanglider but grabs back onto it] Phew... SpongeBob: Let go... got it! [lets go of the steering wheel and drives around a curve] Whee! Tony Jr.: Go faster, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Faster? Tony Jr.: Just let go! Of the brakes! SpongeBob: Eh... if you say so! [sticks up  his foot higher letting go of the brake and going even faster around more curves] Whee! [goes down the street] Whee! [goes over a loop] Whee! Tony Jr.: Now you're getting it! SpongeBob: Whee... red light! [notices the light turning red] Tony Jr.: Ah! SpongeBob: [instantly stops the boat] Tony Jr.: Real cool, SquarePants... [now beside SpongeBob in the boat] SpongeBob: Thanks, TFJ... [notices three fish in another speedboat beside them] Street Racer: That's quite a fancy speed boat you got right there! For a couple of squares! Female Passenger: What he said! [all three laugh] SpongeBob: Thank you! And may I say how lovely your speed boat is, too! For a bunch of circles! And by circles, I mean well-rounded individuals! [laughs] Street Racer: Well, wise guy, eh? Well then, how about you wise up to an unfriendly competition? Right here, right now! Female Passenger: Yeah! What he said! SpongeBob: Right here, right now? A little short notice... [takes out a small book] let me check my availability. [looks in the book] Let's see... right now... looks like I don't have anything scheduled for right now. Therefore, I would like to accept your challenge! Tony Jr.: Yes! SpongeBob: However! Certain safety concerns prevent me from doing so! Therefore, I must decline! Tony Jr.: SquarePants! I can't believe what I'm hearing here! SpongeBob: [tries to listen for something] I don't hear anything. Tony Jr.: [face-palm] Ah... look kid! Being cool includes accepting this challenge! Anything less would be an embarrassment! SpongeBob: I would never want to embarrass you, Tony Jr. Therefore, I accept your challenge! Street Racer: Oh, it's on! Female Passenger: What he said! Street Racer: Do you mind? [Both racers get ready as the red light changes to green and they both take off through the town. They pass fish in which they rip their clothes off and onto another. SpongeBob starts to get the lead.] Street Racer: Huh? [speeds up passed SpongeBob and Tony Jr.] Hah hah! Female Passenger: What he said! SpongeBob: Grr... Grr! [presses down harder on the gas pedal which starts to catch in flames as he speeds passed Larry the Lobster burning him] Larry: Sweet! Instant tannage! [SpongeBob catches up to the male race driver as they continue to drive beside each other] SpongeBob: [growls] Grr! Street Racer: [laughs until the female passenger points out to him, his eyes go through his glasses as there is a sign saying \"Click It or Ticket\" with police near by, then goes quick and slows down] SpongeBob: We're winning! We're winning! [SpongeBob and Tony Jr. laugh as they speed passed the police car] Policeman 1: Whoa! Did you see that? Policeman 2: That guy wasn't just going fast... Both: ...He was going Tony Fast! SpongeBob: [notices the police car] Huh? Oh, no! The cops are after us! What are we going to do? Tony Jr.: What? Sorry, I couldn't hear you over that siren. [A police helicopter now follows them] SpongeBob: Now there's a helicopter after us! Tony Jr.: What's that? I couldn't hear you over that helicopter! [Tony Fast is in his speedboat listening to the news on his radio] Newsman: And in other news, son of racing legend, Tony Fast is currently involved in a high speed chase, it is rumored that the... [SpongeBob and Tony Jr. drive passed Tony Fast with the police car and police helicopter still following them] Tony Fast: What the? SpongeBob: What're we going to do!? [notices Tony Fast in the mirror chasing them] Tony Fast: Tony Jr! When I get my hands on you, I'm gonna- SpongeBob: Now your dad is after us! Tony Jr.: Sorry, I couldn't hear you, my... my... my dad is after us?! What are we gonna do?! SpongeBob: How should I know? He's your dad! Tony Jr.: Well, just remember my advice, okay? All you got to do is let go... be cool... [the camera closely focus on SpongeBob's eyes] Let go... be cool... SpongeBob: [annoyed] Do you see where letting go has gotten us so far?! Huh?! Tony Jr?! [pants heavily] Tony Jr.: No, but I see where it's getting us next! SpongeBob: [notices quickly, screams, then drives through the sign of Mrs. Puff's Boating School and ends up on Mrs. Puff as she inflates] [Cuts to the inside of the classroom] Mrs. Puff: Well, class, I regret to inform you that Tony Jr. is no longer with us. Crowd: Gasp! Mrs. Puff: He was transferred to another school. However, I think maybe Tony Jr. taught us all a valuable lesson... SpongeBob: [on a hospital bed] Oh! Oh! Oh! Never argue and drive? Mrs. Puff: Close... the lesson is: [zoom out to reveal her injuries] Never let you drive!",

        "synopsis": "As the special begins, Patchy the Pirate (parodying the role of S.D. Kluger from Santa Claus is Comin' to Town) drives a mail truck through a snowy mountain range. He stops to wish the viewers a Merry Christmas and tells them he wanted to make sure Santa Claus got his letter. He then lies saying he gave the mailman the day off, he really stole the truck and the mailman is tied up in the back.Potty the Parrot doubts they will make it to the North Pole, then argues with Patchy about which Christmas carol the directions to the North Pole are in. The truck is driven madly until Potty notices there is literally a fork in the road, which gets stuck in one of the tires and causes the truck to spin madly. Patchy then suggests that they see what SpongeBob is doing for the holidays.Patchy drives the truck off a cliff and the mailman escapes. He and Potty get lost in the woods (since the fork got stuck in one of the truck's tires and caused it to go flat, preventing them from being able to drive it any further) and are trying to warm up by a fire. Out of a sense of hunger, Patchy hallucinates and imagines Potty as a platter of buffalo wings. Patchy nearly eats his pet, only to snap out of it. Potty then also hallucinates and imagines Patchy's head as a suet cake topped with birdseed and pecks at it.At the end of the episode, Patchy and Potty make it to the North Pole, believing they finally made it to Santa's workshop. Patchy apparently meets Santa in a cave and tells him his Christmas wish is to meet SpongeBob. However, it turns out he was, once again, hallucinating and really encountered a hungry polar bear, which started chasing him. Watching nearby, the real Santa puts Patchy on the naughty list for stealing a mail truck. They both wish the viewers a Merry Christmas.Set to December 23, SpongeBob is really excited that Christmas is almost here. SpongeBob sees his friends are preparing for Christmas as well. Squidward is stringing lights so Santa knows to \"go away.\" Patrick has set a trap for Santa to make him stop the clocks so they will have Christmas all year long (but he gets trapped in his own trap). Sandy is conducting a Christmas scientific experiment. Mr. Krabs is ready for the season of \"getting.\" Meanwhile, Plankton is not happy, as he gets nothing but coal in his stocking every year, so he comes up with a new plan to ruin the holidays which involves the new element he recently discovered: a large green glowing chunk of what he dubs Jerktonium (Jt). His plan is to give out fruitcakes to everyone in town, each piece spiked with Jerktonium so that anyone who eats it will become a jerk. With everyone except him acting like a jerk, Santa will have no other choice but to put him on his nice list and give what he always wanted to get for Christmas: the Krabby Patty secret formula.Driving a fruitcake dispenser car called the \"Jerkmaker-9000,\" Plankton wonders who will be his first victim when SpongeBob shows up. After feeding him a piece of fruitcake and seeing that he did not become a jerk, Plankton thinks he got a piece that did not have Jerktonium, so he feeds SpongeBob more slices, then whole loaves, and even a baker's dozen, but there is still no effect. His plan having seemingly failed yet again, Plankton tosses SpongeBob the keys to the cake dispenser before kicking it and heading back into the Chum Bucket irritatedly. Driving the fruitcake dispenser up to a trio of Christmas carolers, SpongeBob gives them each a piece of fruitcake. Upon consuming it, they get enveloped in a green aura, grow five o'clock shadows and burly eyebrows, and begin arguing about which song to sing. Thinking they are just being passionate about the holidays, SpongeBob drives off to find more people to pass the fruitcake out to. Plankton, hearing the racket, comes out of the Chum Bucket and sees the carolers arguing, much to his delight. The Jerktonium works after all! Getting on a unicycle, Plankton follows after SpongeBob to see him unwittingly carry out his scheme.Coming up to a Christmas parade in town, SpongeBob starts tossing fruitcake to everyone present: the spectators, the parade Santa, and even the driver of the parade float, totally unaware of the transformation everyone is undergoing. Plankton is pleased that soon, everyone in town will be jerks, except SpongeBob.Consulting Karen, Plankton discovers that SpongeBob's extreme purity-of-heart and innocent love of the Christmas holidays shields his heart from the effects of the Jerktonium, thereby making him immune. Knowing that SpongeBob still being on the nice list would likely ruin his plan, Plankton is forced to unleash \"Plan B\": an evil wind-up robot clone of SpongeBob, named \"ToyBob,\" to destroy Bikini Bottom and ruin SpongeBob's good name. The robot begins its campaign of naughtiness by throwing a boat into a building and trapping Mr. Krabs inside the Krusty Krab by burning down its sign.Later that day, as he returns from feeding fruitcake to everyone in Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob crosses paths with the carolers, who bad-mouth him. As SpongeBob passes the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs is (cheaply) fixing the sign, Mr. Krabs says that the repairs are coming out of his salary, thinking SpongeBob had destroyed the sign. Then he sees Patrick, who also became a jerk by setting another trap for Santa and tells SpongeBob to leave before falling in it again. The next morning, it's Christmas Eve, SpongeBob finally notices that everyone is being mean. Afraid that Santa might fly by Bikini Bottom, he asks Squidward for help, but Squidward (the only one in town who did not eat Jerktonium) claims he is not home, which SpongeBob immediately falls for and decides to go see Sandy on Squidward's suggestion. Right after SpongeBob leaves, ToyBob knocks (or more specifically, bumps) Squidward's door, and when he (still angrily) refuses to let ToyBob in, he grabs the door and smashes it on Squidward's head after he furiously demands ToyBob the door back.Meanwhile, SpongeBob goes to Sandy's treedome to explain, but she is also a jerk. SpongeBob accidentally drops some fruitcake Sandy had been eating into her Christmas Magic Analyzer, which shows that it is contaminated with Jerktonium. Sandy asks where SpongeBob got it from, and he answers Plankton. Sandy asks again in disbelief that he would take the fruit cake from the known-to-be evil Plankton and just hand it out to people without suspicion, to which SpongeBob stupidly says \"uh-huh.\" Sandy then calls him an idiot and explains to him that his foolish actions have caused the whole town to act mean; this causes SpongeBob to understand and get worried since he ate tons of Jerktonium. After discovering from a scan that SpongeBob is immune to Jerktonium, Sandy notes everyone else needs an antidote, Sandy sets her analyzer to come up with one. However, she cannot make sense of the formula notes. SpongeBob realizes that it is actually a music sheet. After SpongeBob recites some of the notes, Sandy instantly returns to normal, making SpongeBob realize the song is the antidote.Getting to the center of town, where everyone is having a riot, SpongeBob begins singing the song \"Don't Be a Jerk.\" One by one, all the Bikini Bottomites become good and respectful again as they sing along with Squidward later joining in.With everyone else back to normal in not a moment too soon, Santa comes down from the sky on his sleigh. SpongeBob excitedly greets Santa, however, he is afraid to say that he is the bearer of bad tidings: everyone in town is on the naughty list this year and everyone will get coal, except Plankton, much to everyone else's shock. Santa states that he is just as surprised as them, but compared to everyone else, Plankton has been a saint. Much to Mr. Krabs' astonishment, Santa gives Plankton the Krabby Patty formula as his present. Pearl then directs Mr. Krabs' attention to the elves who are in the process of picking his wallet from his pocket, making Mr. Krabs swat them away.Stunned to see that his attempt to save Christmas has failed, SpongeBob tries to explain to Santa that he has it all wrong, but he refuses to listen by saying that SpongeBob (on the contrary) is the worst of all, believing that he is still wreaking havoc in Bikini Bottom.At that moment, ToyBob arrives (with Plankton realizing he made a huge mistake) and, upon spotting Santa, carries out his programming to destroy Christmas by morphing into a larger form and eliminating him. SpongeBob tries to protect Santa, but is easily defeated when the robot throws him far away. Santa tries to hide in the Krusty Krab, but ToyBob captures him. SpongeBob saves Santa by using the fruitcake-dispenser to shoot fruitcake at it, clogging its vent holes and causing it to fail. SpongeBob manages to get Santa to safety just before ToyBob explodes into pieces. Santa thanks SpongeBob for saving him and tells him that he has been indeed a very good lad, unlike the \"owner of ToyBob.\" One of the elves gives Santa ToyBob's key, which is inscribed with \"If found, please return to the Chum Bucket,\" revealing to Santa that Plankton was responsible for all the trouble, enraging him. With that, Plankton attempts to escape with the Krabby Patty formula, only be stopped by Mr. Krabs, who calmly tells him to hand over his secret formula without making the situation become more worse. Mr. Krabs takes back the formula, tosses Plankton to Santa's Sleigh and Santa has the elves dump coals on Plankton as punishment for his actions, much to Plankton's dismay. Santa then leaves everyone to celebrate the rest of the holidays (except Squidward). SpongeBob, looking around, asks if anyone has seen Patrick. The special then ends by showing Patrick on the back of Santa's sleigh and netting him, throwing him and the reindeer off course.",

        "transcript": "[A mail truck drives through a mountain range. Patchy the Pirate is driving the truck. He appears to be parodying S.D. Kluger from the song \"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town.\"] Patchy: Merry Christmas, kids! I bet you're wondering why ol' Patchy has this mail truck. Well, this year, I wanted to be absolutely sure Santa got me letter, so I gave Mr. Mailman the day off. [He puts his pirate hat on the mailman tied up and gagged in the back of the truck, puts on his mailman hat and closes the door] Potty: Do you even know how to get to the North Pole? Patchy: Oh, Potty, you silly parrot. Everyone knows that the directions to the North Pole are in the lyrics of the song \"Jingle Bells.\" ♪Dashing through the snow, in a... [Mumbles] Through the fields we go. Fa la la la la.♪ Okay. So we're looking for some fields here. Potty: No, Patchy, the directions to the North Pole are in the song, \"There Goes Santa Claus.\" ♪There goes Santa Claus. There goes Santa Claus. Left on Santa Claus Drive.♪ Scurvy brain. Patchy: Yeah, well, we ain't turnin' till we see some fields. Potty: Look out! There's a fork in the road! Patchy: I don't see no fork. [The truck spins after the fork gets caught in the tire and they both scream.] Patchy: While we wait for the truck to stop spinning, let's see what SpongeBob is up to this Christmas. [The camera zooms in on Bikini Bottom and into SpongeBob's pineapple house. SpongeBob and Gary are sleeping. SpongeBob's alarm clock goes off and sleigh bells are heard instead of the foghorn noise. SpongeBob wakes up.] SpongeBob: ♪Oh, it's drawing very near. My favorite time of the year. [He jumps out of bed and up the ladder] The snow is falling and the cold wind blows. [He gets up on the diving board, and jumps on it] Christmas is almost here. [He jumps up, automatically removing his pajamas and changing into his square pants] And I know that Santa, Santa. Santa has his jolly little eyes on me! [He spins Christmas lights around his pineapple] It keeps me warm and filled with glee to know Santa has his eyes on me. I light my house like a Christmas tree. Fa la la la la la la la lee. 'cause Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little... [A Santa hat pops out of SpongeBob's head] Eyes on me.♪ [He walks over to Squidward's house where Squidward is putting up lights] SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! What are you doing today? Squidward: Stringing lights so Santa knows, in no uncertain terms... [Turns the lights on, which say \"GO AWAY\"] ...to go away! SpongeBob: Okay... [Skips up to Patrick next to a box on a stick tied with string to a cookie] ♪Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me. He sees everything I do, with his left eye on me and his right eye on you!♪ [sees the box] Ooh, what's that? Patrick: It's a trap! A trap for Santa! SpongeBob: Ooh. Baited with Christmas treats? Patrick: [in the tune of \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\"] ♪I will trap Santa in my box, locked up like Fort Knox and make him stop the clocks. And we'll have Christmas all year long!♪ Hey, a cookie! [Patrick goes for the cookie and the box traps him.] SpongeBob: ♪Ohh... Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me! Fa la la la la la la la la lee! [sees Sandy's treedome] And who is that I see? Underneath her Christmas tree?♪ Sandy: ♪Oh, Christmas, oh, Christmas its sweet mystery. I'll mix a dash of Christmas cheer with a candy cane and deconstructed alchemy.♪ SpongeBob: Merry Christmas, Sandy! Sandy: Merry Christmas, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob skips to the Krusty Krab] SpongeBob: ♪Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me.♪ Hi, Mr. Krabs! Are you ready for Christmas? Mr. Krabs: Why, Christmas is me favorite time of the year! After all, 'tis the season of gettin'! SpongeBob: Don't you mean the season of giving? Mr. Krabs: Exactly! The more you give, the more I get. [Laughs] Plankton: ♪Oh, Santa, Santa, Santa has his eye on me. He's seen everything I've done. Every plot, plan, and scheme. It's just a bit of fun. Santa has his eye on me. Every naughty deed is written in his scroll. So every Christmas morning, I get a stocking full of coal!♪ [Dumps out coal from his stocking] Karen: Maybe you'd get a real present from Santa if you weren't the biggest jerk in Bikini Bottom. Plankton: I'm way ahead of you, Karen! [Periodic Table lowers from ceiling. Plankton walks over to it and sticks a piece of notepad paper on it. The paper says Jt for Jerktonium] There is one element in the known universe that can turn even the nicest sap into the biggest jerk they can be! And I, Plankton have discovered it. Behold! [Plankton pulls a lever] Jerktonium! [A piece of Jerktonium contained in a glass capsule lowers from the ceiling] I'll give everyone in Bikini Bottom a present of the most innocent of all holiday goodies. The fruitcake! [picture of a fruitcake appears on screen while he says the fruitcake] And each and every slice will be laced with Jerktonium! Once ingested, no one can help becoming the biggest, creepiest, meanest jerk ever! Then Santa will realize that Sheldon J. Plankton isn't so bad after all! And then I'll finally get what I really want for Christmas, the Krabby Patty secret formula! [Plankton jumps on an oven and holds the fruitcake] And now for the main ingredient, Jerktonium! Okay, Jerktonium, do your stuff! It's complete! [Laughs] Ha ha! The Jerkmaker 9000 will make doling out tainted fruitcake a breeze! Now, who's gonna be my first victim? SpongeBob: Hey, Plankton! What've you got there? [Gasps] Hey! Is that a fruitcake dispenser? You don't suppose I could have a piece, do ya? Plankton: Sure thing, fruitcake! Here you go! [Presses button on the dispenser as a robotic arm gives SpongeBob a fruitcake!] Plankton: Hot from the oven and full in lovin'! SpongeBob: Ooh! Ooh! Hot! Hot! Hot! [Sighs as he takes a bite] Wow! This is great! Plankton: So, how do you feel, kinda cranky? SpongeBob: No. Plankton: Sorta surly? SpongeBob: Mm-mm. Plankton: Maybe just a little bit jerky? SpongeBob: No. I feel just how this cake tastes! Absolutely delicious! Plankton: Hmm... He must have gotten a piece without Jerktonium! Here. Try some more. SpongeBob: Don't mind if I do! [He eats the fruitcake] Plankton: How's your dander? Is it up? SpongeBob: No. How could I possibly be angry when my taste buds are swimming in Christmas cheer? [He takes another piece; cut to inside of his mouth] Taste Bud: Oh, boy, here comes some more! Yaaaay! Plankton: Grrr! Have some more! [He fires a piece into SpongeBob's mouth] Have a whole loaf! [The arm stuffs a loaf into SpongeBob's mouth] Have a baker's dozen! [He fires 15 fruitcakes into SpongeBob's mouth] Well? SpongeBob: Well … [He swallows] I think everyone should taste your amazing fruitcake! Plankton: You know what? Knock yourself out. [He throws SpongeBob the keys to the dispenser] Stupid hunk of junk -tonium! My gift to Bikini Bottom. Boy, oh, boy. [He goes back into the Chum Bucket] SpongeBob: [Rides the dispenser up to 3 carolers] Hello, fellow revelers! Would you like a Christmas treat? Bill: Why, sure, SpongeBob! Fish 2: Yeah, who doesn't like treats? SpongeBob: [Dives into the dispenser and emerges with a plate of fruitcake] Nothing loosens up the old pipes like some fruitcake. Dig in! [They all take a piece] Fish 2: It's like a present for my mouth! SpongeBob: I knew you'd like it. Bill: [Grows bushy eyebrows, bags under his eyes, and five-o'clock shadow] Hey! Did we come here to sing or eat fancy cake? Fish 2: Whoa, calm down, Bill! What do you want to sing? Bill: Well, I want to sing the only Christmas song that matters, and that's “Jingle Bells”. From the top! A one and a two and a – Fish 3: [Turns into a jerk] No, hold your holly! We're singing the best Christmas song ever, and that's “Silver Bells”! Bill: Wrong bells, buddy! Fish 2: [Turns into a jerk] Hey, I want to sing “Randolph the Red-Nosed Seahorse”! [They all continue to argue] SpongeBob: [Driving away, unaware that they have been poisoned with Jerktonium] Great to see people so passionate about the holidays. Plankton: [Emerges from the Chum Bucket on a unicycle] What's all the racket? What do you know? The Jerktonium seems to work on these jerks. Very interesting. [Cut to a shot of a Christmas parade in town] SpongeBob: Oh boy, a Christmas parade! The perfect occasion to spread some mouthwatering joy. [Singing] Oh, everyone, try some hot fruitcake today. Eat it all up and you will shout “Hooray!”! Bikini Bottomites: Yay! SpongeBob: Everyone can get behind a mouthful of warm sunshine, everyone eat a Christmas time cliché. [People start turning into jerks. Somebody pops a kid's balloon. Another person smashes a gift over somebody's head. Pearl squirts water at passers by] Everyone can get behind a mouthful of Christmas time, let's all eat some hot fruitcake today! Plankton: [Cycling through the rioting town] This just keeps getting better and better. Costumed Santa: [On a float, with a boy on his knee] Ho ho ho! So, little boy, what would you like for Christmas? Boy: I want a sled and a truck and a bike and a train ... SpongeBob: Hi, Santa! Have some fruitcake. [He throws a piece] Boy: And a water pistol and a helicopter and – and, uh ... Costumed Santa: [Turns into a jerk] Well, why don't you get a job and buy all that junk yourself? And while you're at it try brushing your teeth, you little - SpongeBob: Have some fruitcake! [Hands a piece to the float driver] Driver: Thanks! [He turns into a jerk, which shocks him in surprise] That's it! I'm outta here! [He frantically leaves the float and it crashes off the end of a cliff] Boy: [Bouncing on the Costumed Santa's belly] Whee-ee-ee! Oh, yeah. And I want a trampoline! Plankton: Success! Soon all the Bikini Bottomites will be jerks! Now I just need to figure out what to do about old SpongeBoy. [Cut to Plankton's lab] Karen: Once again your master plan is fatally flawed. [She brings up a diagram] It seems that SpongeBob's innocent love of the holidays shields his heart from the effects of Jerktonium. SpongeBob Diagram: Dahahaha! That tickles. Plankton: Drat! That square-head's gonna throw my whole naughty to nice curve right off! I guess it's time to introduce Plan B. [He pulls a lever and a giant SpongeBob robot drops from the ceiling] Hahahahaha! Plan B, meet Karen. Now go, my automated agent of naughtiness, go and destroy SpongeBob's good name! [He laughs evilly but nothing happens] Huh? Oh yeah. [He winds up a key in its back] ToyBob: I am ready, I am ready, I am ready. Ready to destroy Christmas. [Flames shoot from his nose. He leaves the Chum Bucket and destroys a car, then heads for the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs: What's goin' on out here? Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob. [ToyBob burns the Krusty Krab sign, which collapses on Mr. Krabs] Plankton: Oh, SpongeBob, you've been a bad, bad toy! [The mail truck is still spinning out of control and finally comes to rest. The bound and gagged mailman escapes and jumps away] Patchy: I can't believe we survived that horrifying car accident without a scratch. [He gets out of the truck and slips on the ice] Ow! [He notices the fork in the tire] Aw, here's the problem. Oh, that's not good. Flat tire, huh? Looks as sad as an empty bag of beef. Brrr! It's cold up here. Why don't you kids at home go make a nice hot cup of cocoa while Potty builds me a fire? [We see Potty and Patchy huddled around a fire.] Patchy: [Shivering] Hello, kiddies. It's so cold, me eye patch cracked. There hasn't been any food or water or food or food for over 20 minutes. [Coughs] Boy, I could sure go for some buffalo wings right about now. Sounds good. Eh, Potty? [Patchy looks at Potty and imagines him turning into a plate of buffalo wings] With a side of blue cheese dressing. [He grabs a fork, licks his lips, and lunges at Potty who flies up. Patchy bites on the log Potty was sitting on] Potty: Squawk! What are you doing? Patchy: I'm sorry, Potty, I don't know what got into me. I'm just so hungry! Potty: It's okay, Patchy, I can't stay mad at you. Patchy: Aww. [Potty imagines Patchy's head turning into a suet cake covered in bird food] Patchy: Why are you looking at me like that, bird? [Potty pecks at his head] What are you doing? [Cut to SpongeBob's storyline; SpongeBob is riding the dispenser through Bikini Bottom and comes across the three carolers he first gave Plankton's fruitcake to] SpongeBob: Merry Christmas, fellas! Bill: Ah, go stuff a stocking! SpongeBob: Gee. That wasn't very nice. [He drives past Mr. Krabs, who is mending the Krusty Krab sign] Seasons greetings, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs: Wha-... Well, you got some nerve, SpongeBob! This is comin' outta yer salary! SpongeBob: What's that all about? [He drives up to Patrick, who is setting another trap ] Hey, Patrick! What're you up to? Patrick: I think it's pretty obvious, SpongeBob! [He eats a slice of fruitcake] I'm eating fruitcake and setting a tiger trap for Santa! Now, if you don't mind, I'm kind of busy right now. SpongeBob: Yeesh, okay. Don't have to be a jerk about it. Everybody's on edge today. Must be the holiday jitters. Patrick: NosyPants. [He falls into his own trap] Yay, it works! Oh. Hello, big, striped shrimp. [ He screams as it attacks him] [The next morning, SpongeBob steps outside] SpongeBob: Ah, Christmas Eve! When all of Bikini Bottom is filled with good will. Johnny: Merry Christmas, Frankie. Frankie: Merry Christmas to you, too, Johnny. [Throws a snowball in Johnny's face] SpongeBob: More like bad will! Gosh, if people don't start acting nicer, Santa's going to fly right past Bikini Bottom this Christmas Eve! I'm gonna need some help. [Snowflake transition; he knocks on Squidward's door] Squidward! Squidward: [From inside] I'm not home! SpongeBob: Oh gosh, what do I do now? Squidward: Why don't you go bother Sandy? SpongeBob: Good idea, Squidward. I'll have to thank you when you get home. [He leaves, and ToyBob walks up to Squidward's house, knocking on the door by walking into it] Squidward: I said I'm not home! [ToyBob wrenches the door off its hinges] SpongeBob, give me back my door! [ToyBob smashes it over Squidward's head] [Snowflake transition to Sandy's treedome] SpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy! I need your help! It's Christmas Eve and everyone in Bikini Bottom are acting like jerks! You gotta help me find out why. Sandy: [Turns around and bares her teeth, scaring SpongeBob, showing that she's become a jerk] Why should I help all them jerks? SpongeBob: Because those jerks don't care about Christmas any more, Sandy! It's a problem. Sandy: Problem? My only problem is I'm out of fruitcake. Only thing I've got left to eat are boring old nuts. [She throws one at SpongeBob] SpongeBob: Oh, the problem isn't the fruitcake! The problem is that everyone, including you, is acting like a jerk! Oh, I'll have to solve this on my own. [He turns to leave and slips on a nut, accidentally throwing the fruitcake into Sandy's Christmas analyzer] Whoa! Sandy: Dagnabbit, SpongeBob, you got fruitcake in my Christmas magic analyzer! [An alarm sounds] Well, I'll be hornswaggled. My analyzer's found something in the fruitcake! [She looks at the reading and gasps] This is terrible! SpongeBob: What is it, Sandy? Sandy: The fruitcake is contaminated with Jerktonium! No wonder I've been as ornery as a sidewinder on a hot driveway. Jerktonium is the orneriest element of them all and your fruitcake is full of it. Where'd you get that fruitcake, anyway? SpongeBob: From Plankton, he baked it. Sandy: You took food from Plankton and fed it to everyone in town? SpongeBob: Uh-huh Sandy: You're an idiot. SpongeBob: Uh-huh Sandy: No wonder everyone in town is a big old meanie. SpongeBob: [Realizes] Oh! I've eaten tons of that fruitcake! I must be the biggest jerk in town! Sandy: [Pokes him] Hmm … You don't act jerky. For some reason, it's not affecting you. [She puts a scanner in front of him] It must be a combination of your tiny brain and pure heart. You're immune to Jerktonium, SpongeBob, but the rest of us will need an antidote. I'll set the analyzer to calculate the formula. [She pulls a switch and a music score pops out] Why, this formula for the antidote don't make no sense at all! SpongeBob: Hmm… That's no formula! It's a song! [He hums it, and Sandy becomes her normal self] Sandy, the song is the antidote! [Cut to downtown Bikini Bottom, where people are still rioting] Fish 6: Oh yeah? Well your fins are fat! SpongeBob: Ahoy, everybody! [He snaps his fingers and mistletoe appears over the heads of the two fish he fed Plankton's fruitcake to, curing them of Jerktonium poisoning. He snaps again and a pile of presents appears, curing two other fish. A little boy begins to play Christmas baubles like bells] SpongeBob: ♪Bring joy to the world, it's the thing to do, but the world does not revolve around you. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas! [Throws a snowball at Mr. Krabs and cures him] Be nice to babies and animals, old folks, too. 'Cause that's how you'd like them to treat you! Use turn signals. Don't screen my calls. Don't you wreck the house when you deck the halls. Spit your gum where it won't wind up on my shoe. Squeeze toothpaste from the bottom of the tube. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas! It's Christmas! [Hands a gift to Pearl, who continues to pass it down a line, curing people as they receive it, except for Squidward, who was unaffected by the Jerktonium] When others are talking, never interrupt. Don't put people down or leave the toilet seat up. It's the time for families and holly and turkey. 'Tis the season to be jolly, not jerky!♪ SpongeBob's Friends and Co.: [in background chorus' voices] ♪Jolly, not jerky!♪ SpongeBob: ♪Santa brought nearly every gift on your list. Why whine about the one that he missed? Don't be a jerk, it's Christmas! It's Christmas! Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas!♪ Sandy: Congratulations, SpongeBob, your song worked! SpongeBob: And not a moment too soon. Santa should be here any minute. Mr. Krabs: You ain't kiddin'. Here he comes now! [They all clear the way as Santa Claus' sleigh and reindeer land in front of the Krusty Krab] SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Santa! You made it! Santa: Whoa, ho, ho, ho, ho! Cool your jets there, son. I'm afraid I'm the bearer of bad tidings. SpongeBob: Oh, no! Santa: Oh, yes . It seems you're all on my naughty list this year. SpongeBob: Naughty list?! Santa: No buts about it. You've all been a bunch of jerks . SpongeBob: But---! Santa: But nothing . Coal for everyone! Except Plankton . SpongeBob, Friends and Co.: Wha-a-at! Santa: I'm just as surprised as you , but compared to the rest of you, he's been a saint . [Hands him the Krabby Patty formula] Here you go, Sheldon, I believe this is what you asked for. Mr. Krabs: Me secret formuler? How did you get that? Santa: I have my ways. [ An elf reaches into Mr. Krabs' pocket and takes his wallet] Pearl: Um... Dad? Mr. Krabs: Huh? [Slaps the elf] Get out of me pocket, ya foul goblin! SpongeBob: But- but- but- but- but- but---! [Patrick slaps him] But, Santa, you've got it all wrong ! Santa: On the contrary, SpongeBob, you're the worst of all. There you go, right now—wreaking havoc ! [The crowd parts and reveals the rampaging ToyBob] Plankton: [Realizing he made huge mistake] Uh-oh. ToyBob: [Searches the citizens around and spots Santa] I am ready to destroy Christmas. [transforms into his mega mode] Destroy Santa. SpongeBob: If you want Santa, you gotta get through me! Mega ToyBob: Okey-dokey. [Karate chops SpongeBob] Santa: Oh, my. SpongeBob: Is that all you got? [Mega ToyBob picks him up and flings him far away and releases a flame] Santa: I'm outta here. [He hides in the Krusty Krab, but ToyBob finds him and picks him up] You do realize this counts as, naughty . SpongeBob: You put that jolly elf down, you big tin imposter! [Fires fruitcake at Mega ToyBob] Hot from the oven, full of lovin'! [Rushes back to rescue Santa] Hurry up, Santa, hop on! [Mega ToyBob shorts out and explodes] Santa: Thanks again for saving my keister. SpongeBob: Oh, it was nothing. Santa: You're clearly a very good lad, unlike the owner of that wind-up monstrosity . [An elf hands him the wind-up key] What have we got there? \"If found, please return to the Chum Bucket\"? Plankton?! Plankton: [Knowing he is in big trouble] Uh-oh. Mr. Krabs: Hand it over, Sheldon. Don't make it any worse. [Takes the Krabby Patty formula. Plankton gets flung at Santa's sleigh, and he splatters all over it. He falls off, leaving squish marks on the sleigh] Santa: O.K., boys, let's give Plankton what he deserves . [The elves pour coal onto Plankton. Coal rock transition to later.] So long, kiddies! Ho-o-o-o, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! [He flies away as everyone [except Squidward] waves goodbye to him] SpongeBob: Hey, has anyone seen Patrick? Patrick: [Hiding on Santa's sleigh] Hee hee hee hee. I gotcha! [Catches Santa in a net, sending the sleigh off course] [Potty is still pecking Patchy's head] Patchy: [Notices a sign] Santa's workshop? I'm here, Santa! I'm here! Potty: I'm not going in there. Patchy: Santa! [He sits on Santa's lap and pulls out his letter] There's only one thing I wants for Christmas! And it's to meet me hero, SpongeBob SquarePants. [Santa sprinkles magic dust on Patchy to make his wish come true, then the illusion breaks and Patchy realizes he's in a cave with a polar bear who sprinkled him with salt because he wants to eat him. The bear chases him. The scene then cuts to Potty standing next to Santa] Santa: I think stealing a mail truck definitely counts as naughty. Wouldn't you say, Potty? Potty: I sure would, Santa. [They laugh] Both: Merry Christmas.",

        "synopsis": "In the beginning of the episode, Sandy is with her scout troop as they do one final check before they head off to the moon. SpongeBob says he has brought a pack of Fizz Bomb Cola with him and is waiting for a Krabby Patty. Pearl says she brought her pom-poms with her and Squidina says she brought action figures. The group then starts to head to the moon but SpongeBob states he is still waiting for his Krabby Patty order, so an impatient Sandy has to drag him inside her tree. At that time, Squidward comes with SpongeBob's Krabby Patty but sees that SpongeBob is not here, so he drops it off. Suddenly, the rocket takes off with Squidward inside.In space, the gang goes up against an asteroid belt, a cold belt, hot belt, and a radiation belt, with the radiation belt mutating SpongeBob's arm and Squidward himself. Then they make it to the moon, where Sandy assigns jobs to SpongeBob, Pearl, and Squidina. While the gang is doing these tasks, Squidward is looking through craters and seeing live action things. Meanwhile, Squidina and Pearl get in a fight and Squidina throws a rock at Pearl but misses, only to have the rock orbit the moon and hit Pearl in the helmet.Squidward gets out of the craters, and starts thinking that the Moon is a \"No SpongeBob zone.\" SpongeBob is looking for intelligent life, until he hears Squidward echoing \"I'm the man on the moon!\" He then finds the Krabby Patty delivery bag, and toots a horn, and Sandy comes immediately to tell SpongeBob that \"if they were really intelligent, they would've ate it. Speaking of eat, can you go get the lunch I packed in the rocket?\" So SpongeBob goes and tries to get the lunch button, moving the moon out of orbit. Sandy says that that would have disastrous effect on the Earth's tide. The Bikini Bottomites are forced to crawl on the ground to avoid suffocation. Then, strange laughing is happening outside, so the guys go to check it out.It turns out that Santa was sleeping on the dark side of the moon until Squidward accidentally woke him up. Santa then notices that the Earth is further away from the moon. He soon realizes it was because of SpongeBob, due to his history of mayhem. Then the gang try to move the moon back into orbit by burping it back with Fizz Bomb Cola, but when that doesn't work they try to sail it back into orbit, but then that won't work because there is no wind on the moon. So they try to push it back. Soon after, Squidward, Sandy, Squidina, and Pearl get in the rocket and Santa and SpongeBob are using a jack-in-the-box to move the anchor off the moon, but SpongeBob accidentally destroys the moon, with jack. The tide on Earth is now even lower. Then Santa uses a squirt gun and pumps SpongeBob full of water. After that Sandy and the guys get back to Earth, the tide back to normal.Sandy's group returned to Earth, with Pearl and Squidina now on friendly terms. Sandy offers Squidward a part in the club, though he refuses since the adventure was enough for him. Sandy then wonders about SpongeBob, who is acting as the replacement moon, teasing people in a big city. SpongeBob reveals that Santa is bringing them a new moon in December, and the citizens below complain on this news. SpongeBob realizes his error of spoiling the surprise, while Santa passes by and calls him a menace again. SpongeBob then laughs at this while wishing a happy holiday, closing the episode.",

        "transcript": "[The episode begins at Sandy's treedome at night. Sandy is leading her Science Scouts on a very important mission.] Sandy: All right, Science Scouts. One last check on supplies. We all need to be prepared for a campout on the moon. [points to SpongeBob] SpongeBob. SpongeBob: [digs into his backpack and pulls out a pack of Fizz Bomb Cola] Six-pack of Fizz Bomb Cola. [pulls out a bubble wand] Bubble wand. [blows a bubble shaped like the Moon and pulls out a tank top] Mesh tank top. [purrs] And I'm waiting on a Krabby Patty delivery. Sandy: Well, that's not what I had in mind when I said supplies. How 'bout you, Pearl? Pearl: Oh. [digs in her bag and pulls out pom-poms] Pom-poms, [pulls out a megaphone and screams in SpongeBob's face] megaphone, and spirit! [jumps and shakes the treedome, knocking everyone over] Squidina Star: [Annoyed at Pearl] Ugh. Do you always have to rub it in my face that you're a cheerleader? Pearl: [rubs pom-poms on Squidina's face] Yes, I do ! [blows raspberry at Squidina, who glares at Pearl with her arms crossed] Sandy: Scouts, I don't think you cotton to what we're doin'. We're going to the moon! [Bubble Bass shows his butt outside the treedome.] SpongeBob, Pearl, & Squidina: Eww! Bubble Bass: Huh? [pulls up his pants] Mm! [scoffs and leaves] Sandy: No, that moon. [points to the moon in the sky] SpongeBob, Pearl, & Squidina: Ohh! Sandy: Squidina, what did you bring? Squidina: [digs in her bag and pulls out a pair of glasses] Eyeglasses, [pulls out comic books] comic books, [pulls out action figures] and action figures. Pearl: [Now annoyed at Squidina] Ugh! Can a person be any nerdier? SpongeBob: I can. [holds up an ugly picture of himself] Pearl: Ew! Sandy: Remember, Scouts, we're scientists. Let's behave like it. [SpongeBob washes his tank top, hangs it on the clothesline and blows bubbles through the holes.] SpongeBob: Science! Sandy: [grumbles and opens the door] Everybody on board for lift-off? [Squidina and Pearl enter the tree. Pearl's enormous head gets stuck in the door and Sandy pushes her in.] Pearl: Ouch! Sandy: Let's go, Scout! SpongeBob: But I'm still waiting for the Krabby Patty delivery guy. [Sandy takes out her telescope and looks through it. The moon moves directly to the right spot where the X is.] Sandy: The moon is in perfect position for us to launch. [puts her telescope away] We gotta leave now! [grabs SpongeBob and drags him in her tree] [Outside the treedome, someone is ringing the doorbell three times. It turns out to be Squidward, who was supposedly delivering a Krabby Patty to SpongeBob.] Squidward: Hello? Delivery. [grumbles and enters the treedome] Did someone order a Krabby Patty? [walks over to the picnic table and leaves the delivery there; he picks one of Sandy's records and looks at it] Huh? Uhh. Yuck. Hokey hoo-ha for hicks. [the treedome starts to shake and Squidward starts to panic] Ahh! I take it back! I could learn to like songs about tractors...maybe. [Sandy pushes some buttons on her control panel, which causes a shaking motion that scares her scouts.] Sandy: Uh, sorry about that. Just some backfire is all. SpongeBob: Safety first. [Squidina and Pearl fasten their seatbelts. SpongeBob attempts to fasten his, but his seatbelt rolls back. He attempts to tie the seatbelt in a knot, but it unravels and slaps him in the face.] SpongeBob: Ugh, why you! [pulls his seatbelt up, but gets all tangled up in it] Sandy: Uhh… everything okay back there, SpongeBob? [SpongeBob gives Sandy a thumbs up after getting tangled up by his seatbelt. The seatbelt untangles him and flips him in his helmet. Sandy pulls out a lasso and ties SpongeBob down.] SpongeBob: Thanks! Sandy: Three, two, one, launch! [pushes the lunch button and it flips over, revealing a sandwich, an apple, and a carton of milk] Whoops! Lunch. [pushes the launch button] [The treedome begins shaking and is about to launch into space. Squidward runs to the door and attempts to leave, but the vibration makes him fall over. The treedome, now redesigned as a rocket ship, blasts off from the ground and starts flying. Sandy, Squidina, Pearl, and SpongeBob's faces distort as the rocket launches upward. SpongeBob laughs and Squidward's face distorts as well. Squidward crawls over to the dome's glass and sees Bikini Bottom getting smaller below him. The rocket emerges from the ocean, exits the Earth's stratosphere, and directly heads into outer space. Squidward panics, screams, and runs around like crazy. But suddenly, he starts floating since there is no gravity in space.] Squidward: Eh, did I die? Am I a ghost? [screams as he floats around] Sandy: [turns off the rocket's engines] Okay, Scouts, you're free to move about the cabin. SpongeBob: [starts floating] Ooh, whoa! I'm flying, I'm flying! [his skirt falls down, revealing his underwear] Whoop! [covers his underwear and laughs] [SpongeBob's helmet falls off. Then SpongeBob's eyes, nose, and mouth fall off his body while he laughs.] Sandy: [checking the peanut plant's pulse] This peanut plant's pulse is staying steady in zero G. Pearl: [while dancing ballet] I've never been so light before. [spins around uncontrollably, flies directly into some wires and gets zapped by them; she sighs and chuckles] Sandy: Uhh, I gotta fix that. Squidina: [playing with her action figures] Teenage Action Girl, rise to the rescue of Action Dog while Teenage Action Boy floats in the corner and mopes. [imitating] I don't care. Oh, no! Help me! [Pearl floats past Squidina, almost knocking her over] Hey! Watch it, you big orca! Pearl: You watch it, you big dorka! [Squidina blows a raspberry. Bubble transition to later in Sandy's treedome, as the record begins playing country music. The tree's acorns. the running wheel, the Fixin' to Go Nuts record, and the picnic table are floating everywhere. Squidward is cowering in fear, completely unaware of the fact that he is in outer space.] Squidward: There can only be one explanation. I've lost my mind! [starting to lose sanity] All those years working at the Krusty Krab and I finally snapped! [hits his head against the glass and floats down] Ohh, going crazy is actually a relief. [sighs] All my stress is gone. [spins an acorn on his tentacle; suddenly, the rocket is getting hit by asteroids and space junk outside; Squidward screams in panic] All my stress is back! Sandy: Uh-oh, we've got space junk! [hops into her chair and begins pushing buttons on her control panel] Everybody, back in your seats. Trays in upright positions. Head between your knees. Your mama can't save you now! [SpongeBob, Squidina, and Pearl sit back into their seats and fasten their seatbelts. The rocket continues flying through the asteroid belt despite getting hit by space junk. A bowling ball crashes into the window and Sandy hits it back outside with a bat.] SpongeBob: [cheers with Squidina and Pearl] Home run! [whistles] [Sandy closes the damaged window with a pair of trousers. The rocket safely makes it out of the asteroid belt.] Sandy: We've still get a few Astro Belts to get through. Brace yourselves for the cold belt! [The rocket flies directly into the cold belt, which is a ring of snowmen, igloos, freezers, and icebergs. Squidward floats around while frozen in a block of ice. SpongeBob is building a snowman version of Patrick Star and laughs. Pearl and Squidina hover themselves and shiver. Sandy is wearing a warm coat and holding a mug of hot chocolate. She looks out through the telescope.] Sandy: Next up, we got a hot belt! [The rocket flies directly into the hot belt, which is a ring of flaming asteroids and stoves. SpongeBob's Patrick-snowman melts from the hot belt's heat.] SpongeBob: Heh-heh. Patty melt. [chuckles] [Sandy breathes heavily and fans herself with her tail; she goes to look through the telescope, but burns her hands] Sandy: Ouch! [blows her hands, looks through the telescope and sees the radiation belt up ahead] Huh! We're going through the radiation belt! That could cause mutations! Everyone, get under your lead blankets! Pearl: [gasps] Mutations?! I must protect my beautiful face! [puts a lead blanket over her] [SpongeBob pulls a lead blanket out from his bag and puts it over him. The rocket flies directly through the radiation belt. Sandy, Pearl, Squidina, and SpongeBob take cover under their lead blankets. SpongeBob sticks his hand out from under the blanket and his hand becomes mutated. SpongeBob laughs and his hand roars. His hand begins gnawing on his helmet.] SpongeBob: Aww. [chuckles] [Back in the treedome, Squidward begins to suffer from the effects of the radiation belt. The belt's effects mutates Squidward's body into different shapes.] Squidward: Oh, good Neptune! I'm going through puberty again! [his body keeps changing shapes and he shrinks into a baby version of himself] [The rocket makes it safely through the radiation belt and resumes flying to the moon.] Sandy: Okay, Scouts, it's all safe now. [Squidina, Pearl, and SpongeBob uncover themselves; pulls down her telescope] Let's see where we are. [looks through] Craters, craters— [a giant eyeball appears as a girl screams in the background] Oh! Giant eyeball? Now I'm as confused as a goat on Astroturf. [hears SpongeBob laughing outside] SpongeBob! SpongeBob: [appears outside and looking through the telescope] Hey, there's a tiny little squirrel in here. [Sandy is angrily wagging her tail] How'd you get in there, you little fuzz ball? Sandy: I love the guy, but if his brains were dynamite, he couldn't blow his nose. [The rocket lands and makes a successful touchdown on the moon's surface. The rocket deploys its anchor so it won't float away. Back in the treedome, Squidward pops out from under the picnic table.] Squidward: Huh? We've stopped. It's all over! I'm back home! [laughs as he runs to the front door; he exits the dome and begins walking, but he floats downward since there's no gravity; he then notices the planet Earth in front of him] Wait a minute. That's the Earth. And that down there is the moon? So, somehow the treedome flew here. [looks down] Good Neptune, I'm falling! Wait, if I remember my high school science, on the moon, I'm much lighter than on Earth. Which means...ha! This fall won't hurt me. [But unfortunately for Squidward, as he lands on the moon and despite the zero gravity, he ends up getting crushed and smooshed into his helmet. He starts waddling around on the Moon's surface until he trips and falls into one of the moon's craters. He gets up and pulls himself together from the fall's impact.] Squidward: [blubbers as he shakes his head] Oh, shrimp. Now where am I? Maybe this is the way out. [peaks through the tube and ends up in the desert; a vulture looks down and screeches at him; and pulls his head back from the tube; he runs over to another one] Maybe this one? [peaks through the second tube and ends up in the guitar of the cowboy squirrel] Country squirrel: Are y'all ready to go nuts for some hokey hoo-ha? [The crowd cheers. Squidward screams and pulls himself back from the tube.] Squidward: [walks over to another tube] Third time's a charm? [He peaks through the tube and ends up in his voice actor Rodger Bumpass's storyboard drawing. Squidward and Rodger scream at each other. Squidward pulls himself back from the tube and runs off.] [Bubble transition to back on the moon's surface. Sandy, Pearl, and Squidina exit the rocket and make their first steps on the moon.] Sandy: One small step for a squirrel... SpongeBob: Ooh! [goes to exit the rocket, but trips; he falls on top of Pearl and Squidina and they crash into Sandy's pile of camp supplies] One giant heap for SpongeKind. [laughs] [Sandy activates her camp supplies and all of the tents get set up for camp.] Sandy: All right, Science Scouts, everybody's got an assignment. Pearl, you measure the moon's gravity. Pearl: Rah, rah, sis, moon, bahhh! [floats upward] Sandy: Squidina, you collect moon rocks. Squidina: Way ahead of you, Ms. Scout Ma'am Cheeks! [throws a moon rock and starts looking for more] Pearl: [emerges from underneath a large moon boulder] Grrr-avity! [Squidina sighs and continues her search on more moon rocks.] Sandy: SpongeBob, you can search for intelligent life. SpongeBob: Aye, aye! Hmm...mmm... Sandy: You do know how to recognize intelligent life, right? SpongeBob: Oh, sure. [holds up a saw] I cut open their heads to see if they have any brains. Sandy: [sighs, takes the saw, and gives SpongeBob a horn] If you find anything, just toot. [SpongeBob takes the horn and floats away with it] Now to study the moon's gravitational effects on my nuts. [walks over to her gravitational experiments and begins her tests] [Squidina continues gathering moon rocks until Pearl rubs her pom-poms on her face.] Pearl: I'm number one! You're number two! I'm gonna beat the nerd out of you! Squidina: [huffs] No one beats the nerd out of Squidina! [throws a moon rock at Pearl] Pearl: Whoa! [ducks from the incoming moon rock] Missed me! [laughs and blows a raspberry] [Squidina's moon rock float around the moon and hits Pearl in the face.] Squidina: Science! Yay! [Meanwhile, Squidward runs out from the moon's crater and boards it shut. He pants from exhaustion, throws his hammer away, and looks at the Earth again.] Squidward: Well, maybe being on the moon isn't so bad. After all, [takes out a tape measure and extends it] SpongeBob is over 238,000 miles away. [pauses and lets go of the tape measure] Random citizen: [gets hit by the tape measure] Ow! Squidward: [gasps] This moon is a no SpongeBob zone! [places a flag with a \"No SpongeBob\" sign on the moon's surface] Here, I'm the man on the moon! [his outburst creates a really loud echo; it was so loud that SpongeBob even heard it] SpongeBob: [pulls out a plastic ear and sticks it on his helmet] Um, did someone say, \"Man on the Moon?\" [looks in the crater] Hello? [stands on a stalagmite] Intelligent life? [peaks out from the crater] How about average smarts? [his bottom sticks out from another crater] I'd settle for common sense! [sighs until he sees Squidward's footprints on the moon's surface] Ooh! Intelligent footprints. [follows the footprints and climbs over the cliff, where he sees the Krabby Patty delivery Squidward was supposed to deliver; he walks over to the bag and honks the horn] Huh? [honks the horn once more] Wha-hoo! [marches around while honking the horn] I found it! I found it! Sandy: [pants as she arrived] What'd you find, SpaceBob? SpongeBob: Intelligent life. [honks the horn and points to the bag] Sandy: [digs into the bag] I'm not so sure about that. [pulls out a Krabby Patty] If they were intelligent, they would have eaten this Krabby Patty. SpongeBob: Ooh! Mmm, speaking of eating... [his stomach rumbles] Sandy: You're right! It's lunch time. [puts the Krabby Patty back in the bag] Would you mind fetching the lunch I prepared? SpongeBob: You bet! Just call me LunchBob. [SpongeBob begins running in place while floating. Sandy pushes SpongeBob down to help him walk on the moon's surface.] Sandy: Just press the button labeled \"lunch!\" [Meanwhile, Squidward is skipping around on the moon's surface like an stupid idiot. He believes that SpongeBob doesn't exist on the moon and is completely unaware that he's already on it.] Squidward: No SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no Sp— [stops at the dark side of the moon] Whoa! The dark side of the moon. [whimpers and peaks into it] SpongeBob? Are you in here? [pulls his head back out] No SpongeBob. [blubbers as he shakes his head] I have a strange feeling suddenly coming over me. Could it be...that I'm...happy? [stupidly walks into the dark side of the moon] [Bubble transition to SpongeBob inside Sandy's rocket trying to figure out which button is the lunch button.] SpongeBob: Lunch, lunch, where's lunch? Oh, there it is. [accidentally pushes the launch button and activates the rocket's engines] Computer: Preparing to launch. SpongeBob: No! [frantically pushes the launch button to stop] No, not launch! Lunch! [grabs a screwdriver and tries to pry the button off] [The rocket reactivates itself and starts to fly away. The anchor hooks itself on the moon's crater and begins pulling the moon into a different direction.] Pearl: Uh, wait, wait—what's going on? [falls over] Squidina: [whimpers] How should I know? [falls over] Sandy: You guys wait here! [climbs up the anchor's chain, enters the rocket and stops the engine] Phew! SpongeBob? [sees SpongeBob outside the rocket] SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Oh, uh, Sandy! [chuckles] Hey, girl. I was just gonna run back home. I forgot, uh...my reading glasses. [sighs and pants while running in space] [Sandy activates a lasso, grabs SpongeBob and drags him back into the rocket.] Sandy: It's okay, SpongeBob. It's my fault for putting the launch and lunch button so close together. [looks at the monitor] Oh, no! The moon's been pulled out of its regular orbit. That could have disastrous effects on the Earth's tides. [Back on Earth and without the moon in its regular orbit, the ocean's tides are lowered. Bikini Atoll has no water and the ocean level in Bikini Bottom is decreasing.] Nat Peterson: Water's a little dry today. [The Bikini Bottomites are doing all that they can to stay alive as long as they can from decreased ocean level.] Sandy: And that last launch depleted our fuel. Santa: [off-screen] Ho-ho-ho. Sandy: That's weird. [Back on the moon, Pearl and Squidina hover together.] Squidina: [pants] I'm so sorry you're a cheerleader! Pearl: I'm sorry you're a nerd! Pearl & Squidina: That came out wrong! [cries] [SpongeBob and Sandy arrive back to Pearl and Squidina.] SpongeBob: Ooh, moon hugs! Make room for me. [hugs Pearl and Squidina] Come on, Sandy, bring it on in. [pulls Sandy in] Sandy: It's all right, Scouts. We just gotta figure out a way to get back to Earth. Pearl: But Sandy, we heard strange laughing coming from... [points to the dark side of the moon] in there. Santa: [off-screen] Ho-ho-ho. [Squidward appears from the dark side of the moon while being held by a mysterious being.] Pearl, Squidina, Sandy, & SpongeBob: Huh? [gasps] SpongeBob: Squidward? You're the man on the moon? Squidward: SpongeBob?! [sighs in defeat] Of course. Why not? [The mysterious being comes out from the dark side of the moon. The being turns out to be none other than the jolly old elf himself: Santa Claus. Santa drops Squidward down.] Squidward: Ohh! [falls on the moon's surface and gets crushed and smooshed in his helmet again] Oh! Oh! Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Santa: [notices SpongeBob] SpongeBob? Ho-ho! I should've known you'd have something to do with this. SpongeBob: Santy Claus! Well, Santa, you know the saying, where SpongeBob goes... Santa: I know, trouble follows. SpongeBob: I was gonna say laughter follows. [laughs] Sandy: Mr. Claus, what are you doing on the dark side? Santa: The dark side of the moon is the only place dark enough for me to get any sleep. [holds up a book and shows a picture of himself sleeping in his sleigh] I was sleeping like a baby—visions of sugar plums. [turns the page and shows picture of Squidward stumbling in Santa's sleigh] Then this bad boy goes and bangs into my sleigh and wakes me up! Squidward: Well, I guess I'm getting nothing for Christmas...again. Santa: [notices the Earth is far away] Holy night, SpongeBob! Did you shrink the Earth? SpongeBob: [stammers nervously] Good question, Mr. Claus. Sandy: We're actually further from the Earth now. We could have moved the moon back into its regular orbit if we hadn't run out of fuel. [looks angrily at SpongeBob as he whistles nervously] Squidina: A controlled explosion might move the moon back. Pearl: [blows her bubble gum and pops] Ha, you're so smart. How do we do that? [SpongeBob strains himself as he thinks. He comes up with a really good idea and forms into a lightbulb. He takes out his pack of Fizz Bomb Cola.] SpongeBob: Ooh! Fizz Bomb Cola! A burp explosion in every can. [prolonged belching sound is heard] [Sandy, Pearl, and Squidina grab a can of Fizz Bomb Cola. SpongeBob opens his can.] Sandy: Yee-haw! That's my Science Scouts! [SpongeBob, Pearl, Squidina, and Sandy open a hole in their helmets and start drinking their soda. The soda's chemicals build up in their stomachs. They all take off their helmets and make the loudest belch in order to move the moon back into place. But nothing happens, since the moon is too heavy to move from such force.] Sandy: No go, the moon's too heavy. [belches and cover her mouth] Santa: [laughs] I think some children might be needing some brains for Christmas. [chuckles] [Pearl, Squidina, and SpongeBob came up with a different idea. They form a sail using their clothes in hopes of blowing the moon back into its orbit, leaving themselves in their underpants. They hoist the sail up with the mast.] Squidina: Perfection! SpongeBob: Now we just wait for a gust of wind. [They wait for a gust of wind. But since there is no air in space, nothing happens.] Sandy: Uh, interesting science fact: there's no atmosphere on the moon, therefore there's no wind. [Santa laughs really hard which causes his belt buckle to fall off.] SpongeBob: [dodges Santa's belt buckle] Why don't we just push the moon back? [Sandy, Squidina, Pearl, and Santa look strangely at SpongeBob. SpongeBob warms up and attempts to push the moon back with all his might. Squidina and Pearl attempt to do the same, but the moon is too heavy for them to move.] Santa: [laughs] You all should be a sea monster because you're Kraken me up! [rimshot] Get it? Kraken? [laughs] Sandy: [hops on his sleigh and grabs his beard] Santa Claus, you can do more than just say, \"Ho-ho-ho!\" at us! You can dig into that toy sack of yours and find something to help! Santa: But I'm having such a jolly, holly time! [Sandy grumbles angrily at Santa] You're right. I'm being naughty, not nice. [Bubble transition back to Sandy's rocket. Sandy, Squidward, Squidina, and Pearl fasten their seatbelts. Santa peaks in the rocket through the window.] Santa: Everyone nestled all snug? Sandy: We're all snug, Santa. But why is SpongeBob with you? SpongeBob: [sitting in Santa's sleigh] Yeah, why am I riding with you? Not that it isn't a pleasure. Santa: I want you close to me so I can keep an eye on you. You're a menace! [flies his sleigh above Sandy's rocket; SpongeBob falls on Santa's face, but Santa pulls him off] First, I'll push Sandy's rocket ship out of harm's way. SpongeBob, hand me that jack-in-the-box. SpongeBob: [digs in Santa's sack and pulls out a jack-in-the-box] Jack-in-the-box. [Santa winds up the jack-in-the-box and launches it at Sandy's rocket. The toy pushes the rocket off the moon's surface.] SpongeBob: Oh, oh! Let me try! [begins winding the jack-in-the-box] Santa: Be careful! Don't overwind it! SpongeBob: But it's gotta be strong enough to move the moon. [carelessly overwinds the jack-in-the-box really tight; the jack-in-the-box stops winding and breaks] Santa: You broke it, and it was my last one. SpongeBob: Hmm. [the handle begins turning slowly] Oh, wait. I think I can hear the last note struggling to get out. Come on, Jack, you can do it. I believe in you! [The jack-in-the-box launches out from the box in a fast pace.] Santa: Ho-ho-ho-ho! [The jack-in-the-box hits the moon. But instead of moving it back as it was supposed to, it ends up destroying the moon completely. Various moon rocks float in all directions. SpongeBob and Santa stare in shock.] SpongeBob: What happened? [Santa grumbles angrily at SpongeBob] Oh. Okay, sorry. It was my bad. [Moon rocks and debris fly around Sandy's rocket. Sandy, Pearl, Squidina, and Squidward look in shock now that the moon is destroyed. Back on Earth and with the moon gone, the ocean level has decreased even more and there is nothing but standing water. Bikini Bottomites are now crawling on their legs and arms.] Frankie Billy: [runs into Martha Smith] Oh, excuse me. Sorry. [chuckles] [Frankie Billy gets up and dries up from the heat so Martha can walk by. Back in space, Santa is overwhelmed at what SpongeBob did to the moon.] Santa: Oh-oh-oh. SpongeBob: Oh-oh-oh? Santa: Ho-ho-ho backwards. [sulks on his sleigh] [SpongeBob thinks and comes up with an idea to stop the problem once and for all.] SpongeBob: [leans closer to Santa's ear] Santa, do you have any water shooters in your bag? Santa: Yes, the whole sack is full of 'em. [SpongeBob digs in Santa's sack and finds a pile of water shooters. SpongeBob grabs a water shooter and gives it to Santa.] SpongeBob: All right, Santa, squirt me. Santa: [takes the water shooter] Oh, I get it. [SpongeBob takes off his helmet and Santa sprays SpongeBob with water to make him bigger.] SpongeBob: Whoo! Keep 'em coming, Santa! [Santa grabs another water shooter and sprays SpongeBob with water to make him even more bigger. Bubble transition to back on Earth, where the Bikini Bottomites are flopping around due to the decreased water level. But then, something miraculous happened. The water level rises up and the oceans are back to normal. Sandy's rocket flies back down to Earth and Sandy's treedome flies back into its rightful place on the ground. Sandy, Squidina, and Squidward exit the tree.] Sandy: Using the leftover Fizz Bomb Cola made an excellent rocket fuel, Science Scout Squidina. Squidina: Yep, the rocket burped us back. [laughs] Pearl: [pulls herself out of Sandy's tree] Wow! Would you mind teaching me some nerdy science stuff? Squidina: Sure, if you'll teach me some airhead cheerleader stuff. [Pearl and Squidina, who have now put aside their differences, skip happily out of Sandy's treedome, nearly knocking over Sandy and Squidward.] Sandy: Why don't you join the Science Scouts, Squidward? Squidward: No, thanks! Science is crazy and filled with lunatics! [leaves in disgust] Sandy: Speaking of luna, I wonder how old SpongeBob is doing. [The scene changes to New York City at night. SpongeBob, now as a temporary moon until Santa creates a brand new one, rises in the night sky and look down at the city.] SpongeBob: Good night, Earth! Hey, I'm mooning you. [laughs] Hello, lady. You sure look lovely by moonlight. Lady: Aww! SpongeBob: Hey, mister! I can see your bald spot. Man #1: Hey! SpongeBob: [laughs] Don't be alarmed, people. I'm only here 'til December, when Santa brings everybody a new moon for Christmas. [The citizens on the ground are honking their horns and groan in confusion as they start complaining.] Man #2: Come on! SpongeBob: Oh, sorry. Just gave away the big surprise, didn't I? Oh, well. Merry early Christmas! Santa: [flies past SpongeBob with his sleigh] Ho-ho-ho! You're a menace! [SpongeBob giggles and winks at the audience, as the episode irises out.]",

        "synopsis": "In the beginning of the episode, Karen and Plankton are counting down to when the chum goes bad. Then, Plankton drives a huge barrel of old chum to the place where he usually dumps it, but when Plankton opens it, he realizes that it is already filled to the top, so he begins to look for other places. He tries the well, but it is also clogged.Along the way, Plankton accidentally stumbles upon SpongeBob, who is walking with Gary. SpongeBob spots a barrel of chum and asks what it is for. Plankton replies that it is for a holiday called Chum Day. On this day, the fish supposedly give each other chum. Then SpongeBob agrees to help Plankton make \"gifts\" in the city, much to his delight. The two of them go to Mr. Krabs' house, where they pour chum under the carpet. Then they start to spread chum everywhere until they finally say goodbye.On the way home, SpongeBob sees that the streets of Bikini Bottom are flooded with chum. The angry residents quickly run to Plankton and want to beat him, but SpongeBob, in a Santa hat, starts to tell and sing about the day of chum. Then the fish are happy and proceed to celebrate, but the sanitary inspector gives Plankton a fine and forces him to eat all the spilled chum for the safety of the citizens, as the episode ends.",

        "transcript": "[The episode begins at the Chum Bucket in the evening.] Karen and Plankton: Five, four, three, two, one! [The chum in the barrel turns brown and explodes all over the laboratory.] Plankton: [wipes rotten chum off his face] You know, it's remarkable how chum goes bad every week right on time. Karen: Yeah, just like your underpants. Plankton: What? They're good for another month. [his underwear pops off his body] Karen: Now go and get rid of that chum before the Health Inspector gives us a fine. [begins to leave, but turns around.] And don't play with it! Plankton: [pokes the rotten chum with a stick and laughs] But it makes a funny sound! [The rotten chum bubbles over and eats the stick. It belches out a foul breath in Plankton's face, making him faint. Plankton takes the barrel of rotten chum out of the Chum Bucket and goes to dump it down the sewer.] Plankton: Hm. [reads the sign] \"No chum dumping. $1 billion fine.\" Eat chum, sign! [sprays rotten chum at the sign; the rotten chum changes the sign that reads, \"Chum Dumping?....Alright fine! (See if I care!)] Ha-ha! [chuckles; tries to open the manhole, but it's stuck] Eugene H. Krabs! [lifts the manhole lid and overfills the sewer with rotten chum] I guess I've used this sewer hole one too many times. [tries to push the manhole lid, but it's too heavy; he paints the chum to make it look like the manhole lid] Those evil painting lessons I took really come in handy. [leaves with the barrel of rotten chum] Business Man: And so I said to Andy that, uh— [sinks into Plankton's rotten chum] Yeah, Larry. I'm gonna have to call you back. Plankton: [takes the barrel of chum to a wishing well] Oh, yeah, this old wishing well. I'll just dump some chum in here. [climbs up the well's wall and looks inside; he sees the well is full of rotten chum] Guess I've gone to this well once too often. [gasps] Wait, I know! [takes out a quarter] I wish this well was empty of chum. [tosses the quarter in the well, but sinks into the chum] Lousy rip off. [leaves with the barrel of rotten chum] [Little did Plankton know, the wishing well magically makes the chum disappear and the business man climbs out.] Business Man: [coughs out the quarter and calls on his phone] And I'm back. [Plankton takes the rotten chum to a local snail park. He pushes the hose through the hole in the fence and into one of the holes in SpongeBob's back. Rotten chum sprays out through SpongeBob's holes and he flies all around in the air. SpongeBob finds this very ticklish and laughs in joy. Down on the ground, Gary and the other citizens in the snail park are getting covered in rotten chum. SpongeBob lands on the ground with rotten chum all over his body.] SpongeBob: That was unbelievable! [sees the rotten chum] Wait a minute. What is this? Chum? Plankton: No, of course not. It's...it's, uh, a gift! SpongeBob: A gift? For who? Plankton: [walks off with the barrel of rotten chum] For you. For everyone. SpongeBob: Sure looks like chum. [follows SpongeBob] [Gary comes out from behind the fence.] Plankton: It's new chum. It's delicious. [eats some rotten chum and gags] SpongeBob: New chum? Ooh, let me try. Plankton: [slaps the rotten chum off of SpongeBob's fingers] No! Uh, you have to wait. For, uh, like a holiday. SpongeBob: Holiday? What holiday? Plankton: Um. Chum Day...? SpongeBob: Chum Day. Tell me about Chum Day. What's it like? What do you do? Plankton: I'll tell you all about it if you help me hide all these gifts. SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Chum Day. A brand new holiday! [turns to Gary] Okay, Gary. You can go home. Gary: Meow. [slithers off, gets into a boatmobile, and drives away off-screen] Plankton: Was that his car? SpongeBob: No. [Bubble transition to SpongeBob carrying Plankton and dragging the barrel of rotten chum down the street.] SpongeBob: Ooh, and does it snow chum on Chum Day? [giggles] Plankton: Uh, sure. SpongeBob: Do the kids make chum men? What about icicles? Do you call them [giggles] Chum-cicles? Plankton: Yeah, whatever. [sees Mr. Krabs' house] Wait a minute. This is Krabs' house. SpongeBob: Uh-huh. I thought we could hide his chum gifts inside by pumping them through the window. [goes up to the window] Oh, darn, the window's closed. Plankton: Hey, what's that? [blasts the window while distracting SpongeBob] The window's open. SpongeBob: Yay! [pushes the hose through the window and sprays rotten chum under the rug] Mr. Krabs: [yawns] Who's there? Wha— [trips over the lump in the rug and groans; he then falls asleep] SpongeBob: Aw. [pushes the rotten chum from under the rug to make it more comfortable] Shh. [takes the hose and exits Mr. Krabs' house through the window] I bet he has visions of sugar chums dancing in his head. [giggles] Plankton: Let's keep moving. [A montage of SpongeBob and Plankton hiding rotten chum in various places is shown. Bubble transition to SpongeBob hides some rotten chum in Patrick's rock. Then he hides it under the hat of a sleeping cowboy. Then he hides rotten chum in the chimney of a house. Then he hides rotten chum inside a child's teddy bear. Mrs. Puff is on her chair watching television and eating popcorn in the middle of the night. SpongeBob plugs her mouth with the hose and inflates her with rotten chum. Bubble transition to the Chum Bucket at the brink of dawn.] SpongeBob: And we'll drink chum-nog and sing around the chum-chum tree and there'll be colorful chum lights all over town. Plankton: Yes. That'd be good. Heh heh. [jumps off of SpongeBob and taps on the barrel] Sounds like there's only one scoop left. SpongeBob: Ooh, that one's for you! Let me hide it. I want to hide it! [Plankton groans and gives SpongeBob the last scoop of the rotten chum.] SpongeBob: Okay now, go home so you don't see where I hide it. Plankton: Oh, no, I wouldn't want to see that. [quietly as he takes the barrel back to the Chum Bucket] What a numbskull. [walks a few miles away from SpongeBob, then stops and looks back] SpongeBob: [sing-songy] No peeking! Plankton: [turns and resumes heading back to the Chum Bucket] Well, Plankton, you got rid of it all. And with no chum-uppance. [chuckles] Whoa. [pauses and looks around before resuming with his evil laughter] [Bubble transition to a very tired SpongeBob trying to find a place for the rotten chum.] SpongeBob: [yawns] What time is it? I guess I should hide Plankton's Chum Day gift before Chum Day's all over. [stops at a manhole] Ah-ha! I bet Plankton would never think to look in the sewer. [kicks the lid open and sees it filled with rotten chum] Oh. Chum. Oh, well. Maybe I can get a little more in there. [puts the chum in but doesn't go down; he pushes real hard to get it to go down then he closes the lid; he chuckles until suddenly, the ground shakes] [Rotten chum erupts from the ground and comes back down as little chum flakes. One man comes out from his house and slips on the rotten chum.] Man #1: [takes out a sign] Caution wet chum! [A lady is driving in her boatmobile, but skids off the road due to the rotten chum.] Lady #1: [crashes into sign and reads it] \"Slippery wet chum?\" Baby: Mmm, nummy! Baby's mother: [slaps the rotten chum off of her baby's hands] Don't eat chum off the sidewalk. Bah! Various Bikini Bottomites: There's chum here! Ew! [chattering angrily] What's with all the chum? Call my lawyer! Plankton: [comes out of the Chum Bucket and sees rotten chum snowing down] What has that yellow idiot done?! [becomes surrounded by an angry mob] Man #1: Our homes have been ruined by you and your stinking chum! Woman: Your chum ruined my hair! Patrick: Your chum made me dumb! Man #2: You were already dumb. Patrick: Well, it didn't make me any smarter! Kid #1: Get him! Angry mob: Yeah! [grab Plankton and prepare to beat him up] [Suddenly, SpongeBob, who is wearing a Santa hat, appears and is ice skating on the rotten chum.] Choir: [sings in the tune of Carol of the Bells off-screen] ♪Chum, chum, chum, chum, chum-chum-chum-chum♪ [SpongeBob skids some of the rotten chum on Patrick and the angry mob.] SpongeBob: We shouldn't be fighting. [picks up two scoops of rotten chum] It's Chum Day. Man #1: Chum Day? Baby's mother: What's Chum Day? SpongeBob: [skates all over the place while singing in the tune of Deck the Halls] ♪ Deck the sea with lumps of new chum / Chuma chuma chum, chum, chum, chum, chum / 'Tis the season to be chum dumb / Chuma chuma chum, chum, chum, chum, chum / Don we now our chum apparel / Chuma chum chuma chum, chum, chum, chum / As we sing this stinky carol / Chuma chuma chum, chum, chum, chum, chum ♪ [Everyone looks at SpongeBob with blank and confused looks on their faces.] SpongeBob: [takes some chum and makes it into a beard, making himself a chum version of Santa Claus] Chum! Chum! Chum! Hello, I'm Chumta Claus. [Everyone is still looking at SpongeBob with blank and confused looks on their faces.] Man #1: So anyway, back to the mob violence. [Just as everyone proceed to beating Plankton to the bone, they stop and notice all the children having fun. Building chum men, making chum angels and throwing chum balls like how they do it when it snows in the winter. A kid on a sled slides up to the angry mob.] Kid #2: Merry Chum Day, everyone. Angry mob: [confused] Huh? [subside their anger and instead greets each other with thanks like how they do it on Christmas] Strong grip, huh? Yeah. Mayor: I officially declare today Chum Day! [kicks the kid on the sled away by accident] [Everyone cheers in excitement. Bubble transition to kids decorating a tree with rotten chum like how they decorate a Christmas tree. The purple kid wakes up and a lump of rotten chum comes out of his teddy bear.] Kid #3: Whoa! Yay! Man #3: [trying to catch chum flakes on his tongue like how everyone does it with snowflakes] Whoo! Heh. Tastes really bad. Nancy Suzy Fish: But the holiday spirit is keeping us in denial. Man #3: [holds up a lump of rotten chum with a toe in it] Gristle toe? [shares a kiss with Nancy Suzy Fish] [Squidward wakes up from his bed and goes to the window. He gasps in wonder and sees chum flakes falling.] Squidward: Huh? [sees Morty walking in the sidewalk] Ah. You! Boy! What day is today? Morty: Today? Squidward: Such an intelligent boy. A remarkable boy. Yes, today! What is today? Morty: Why, it's Chum Day! Squidward: Then I haven't missed it! [pauses] Wait a minute. Chum Day?! That's disgusting! [slams his window shut] [Everyone is continuing their Chum Day festivities.] Plankton: You all love Chum Day? [mutters in excitement] It was me! I invented Chum Day! Chum Day is copy-written by me! [gets bumped into the Health Inspector's shoes] Andy Yellowtail: Uh, excuse me, are you responsible for all this chum? Plankton: Yes, that's right. You're welcome. Andy Yellowtail: Well, as the Health Inspector, [holds up his badge] I've got something for you. [gives Plankton a paper] Plankton: Hm. [reads paper] $1 billion?! [whimpers and faints] Andy Yellowtail: You know, there is a way out of paying the fine. Plankton: I'll do it. What is it? Andy Yellowtail: [holds up a spoon] You can eat up all the chum. [scoops up some rotten chum and feeds it to Plankton] Plankton: [coughs] Isn't there anyone that knows the true meaning of Chum Day? SpongeBob: I know. Plankton: Huh? SpongeBob: Lights, please. [the lights turn off and a spotlight shines on SpongeBob] And lo, there was chum. A food that turned from revolting to festive by magical thinking. And the goodwill of chum clogged the hearts of fish kind and ushered in a new— [gets hit numerous times by chum balls, much to his joyful laughter] French narrator: Several days later... [The scene changes to Bikini Bottom all clean and sparkly again. Plankton, who has become fat from eating all of the rotten chum, scoops up the last remaining of the chum and eats it, much to his discomfort, ending the episode.]",

        "synopsis": "The episode begins on Christmas Eve when Santa is delivering presents. SpongeBob has a gift for him. When Santa comes into his house, he has to shrink himself to fit inside. While he is putting the presents by the Christmas tree, he accidentally kicks his gift under the sofa without realizing it. Seven months later, while SpongeBob is vacuuming his house, he notices that Santa never got the gift. SpongeBob is upset that the gift is 212 days late and tells Patrick about it. They decide to travel to the North Pole. While they are skipping and hopping, they accidentally step on Plankton. They tell Plankton that they are going to the North Pole. Plankton pitches an idea to go to the North Pole to hack into Santa's computer to put his name on the nice list. He wants to do it so Santa will give him Krabby Patty secret formula. He decides to tag along with SpongeBob and Patrick. They travel in Plankton's vehicle and it seemingly takes a day to get there. They end up at Christmas Land Theme Park. They encounter Santa and discover that it is Patchy the Pirate disguising as Santa.Patchy proceeds to tell them they are not at the North Pole but rather a theme park. Plankton admonishes the duo for getting them lost while they realize their error. The three explain that they are trying to find the North Pole and Patchy gives them a map to the North Pole. They eventually all make it to the North Pole. They see Santa's workshop and travel to it. An elf tells them that Santa is on vacation and Plankton goes to Santa's computer to put his name on the nice list. SpongeBob and Patrick cause chaos across the workshop, resulting in a fight. Santa arrives and sees that someone has made a mess. Santa sees SpongeBob and says, \"You're a menace!\" to him. SpongeBob reveals that all he wanted was to deliver the present to him. Santa is delighted by the gesture, as he reveals not even the elves or reindeer give him a present, to their embarrassment. SpongeBob gives Santa a bottle with a letter inside and Plankton thinks it's the Krabby Patty secret formula, but finds out that it isn't. Santa, SpongeBob, the reindeer, and the elves tell Plankton to read the letter. Plankton begrudgingly reads it and it is revealed that it is merely a thank you note to Santa for bringing joy and presents to all. Santa is touched and thanks SpongeBob.Next Christmas, Mr. Krabs has a Christmas party at the Krusty Krab and he gives Plankton some coal. SpongeBob gives Plankton a photo of them with Patchy from their mission to the North Pole. Plankton says that he will destroy everyone with his coal-powered death robot, and he feeds coal to the robot. The episode ends with a shot of the Krusty Krab as everyone can be heard screaming inside while the robot attacks them offscreen.",

        "transcript": "[The episode opens with a shot of Bikini Bottom, where it is snowing, and the town is decorated for Christmas. Cut to inside SpongeBob's house, where SpongeBob is holding a present for Santa. SpongeBob and Gary are wearing Santa hats.] SpongeBob: Ta-dah! This gift is for Santa Claus! [kisses present, then places it under a Christmas tree] Even Santa deserves a gift! Right, Gary? Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: [picks up Gary and spins him, singing to the tune of \"Jingle Bells\"] ♪ Santa Claus, Santa Claus, Santa's on his way! [walking upstairs] I'm giving him a present that he'll take back on his sleigh! ♪ [open shot of his house] Yay! [humming the tune of \"Jingle Bells\"] [Pan up to Santa Claus on his sleigh with his reindeer, flying through the sky.] Santa: Ho, ho, ho! [parks sleigh and approaches SpongeBob's house with a sack] Hmm... [climbs house, trying to fit himself into a pipe, but falls down with it] Oh, yeah, I forgot. [picks up sack] Ho, ho, ho, shrink-o. [sprinkles some dust on him, shrinking him down enough to fit into the pipe] [Humming the tune to \"Jingle Bells,\" Santa enters the house, dancing as he pulls out SpongeBob's present. His butt kicks SpongeBob's present for him out of the way as he continues dancing, putting it behind SpongeBob's sofa. Santa places his gift underneath the tree, and exits SpongeBob's house.] Santa: Ho, ho, ho! [slams door] French Narrator: [narrating time card] Seven months later... [SpongeBob is vacuuming near the sofa, humming.] SpongeBob: Excuse me, Mr. Sofa. [lifts up sofa] Ha, look at that, Gary. Gary: Meow? SpongeBob: It's the present I left for Santa last Christmas. Isn't that nice? [drops vacuum, panicking] The present I left for Santa last Christmas?! [picks up present] He never got it! Oh, this is the worst disaster that's ever happened! Gary: [vocalizing \"uh-oh\"] Meow, meow... SpongeBob: My present to Santa is 212 days later. [begins sobbing] Late, it's a tragedy. [blows nose with present bow] Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: [cradling present] My joyful carefree world is growing dark and dreary! I can't go on! [stops crying] No, I'll go on. [continues crying] But I can't go on! [sobbing] Patrick: [throws roses at SpongeBob, applauding] Whoo-hoo! [whistles] Whoo-hoo! Five stars. SpongeBob: [picking up rose, sniffing it] Patrick, I wasn't acting. Santa never got his Christmas present. Patrick: [shrugs] So why not just deliver it to him? SpongeBob: Why not just deliver it to him? Patrick: [chuckles] That's a dumb idea. [claps] I'm in! SpongeBob: Great! But how will we get there? We can't walk that far. Hmm... Patrick: [squishes face] Oh, we can push and shove each other! SpongeBob: Great idea! We can't let it be [picks up present] one more day late. [opens himself and puts the present inside] Okay, me first. [Patrick shoves SpongeBob ahead, making him roll out of the house. Patrick runs after him, both laughing.] Patrick: My turn! [SpongeBob shoves him, making him roll on the road] Bystander: What the-- SpongeBob: [running after Patrick] Merry Christmas! [laughs] Bystander: Um, it's July? [Cut to the Chum Bucket, where Plankton opens the doors and comes out.] Plankton: Ah, it's a good day to be bad. [inhales, then exhales] Huh? [gets crushed by a landing SpongeBob] SpongeBob: [gets up, laughing] Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob? [points to him] You got a booger. SpongeBob: [looks at Plankton on his nose] Oh! [eyes dart back and forth] Patrick: Don't worry, [pulls tissue from armpit] that's what friends are for. [puts tissue up to SpongeBob's nose] Blow. SpongeBob: [blows into tissue] Thank you. Patrick: [looking inside tissue] Eww! [turns tissue around] It's the ugliest booger I've ever seen. Plankton: [escapes tissue] Can't you screwballs walk without falling? SpongeBob: Sorry, Plankton. [using hand gestures to demonstrate] We're pushing and shoving ourselves all the way to the North Pole. I have to give Santa his Christmas present. [rolls himself up to reveal present] Plankton: Santa? I hate that guy. He's had me on a naughty list ever since I got this tattoo. [rolls up arm, revealing tattoo that says \"Born to be Naughty\"] SpongeBob and Patrick: Born to be naughty? Plankton: Whoo! Wait a minute. [pacing] If I can break into Santa's lair, hack his mainframe, change my status from naughty to nice, I could ask [antennae twist] for the Krabby Patty secret formula and he'd have to give it to me. I'm coming with you. Patrick: [raised hands] Pushed or shoved? Plankton: Shrimp that! [holds remote, pushing a button] We are going in style, babies. [The Chum Bucket's garage door opens, revealing a snow plow-like vehicle with a fish tank.] SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa! Plankton: I built it to fly and run over bodies during the zombie apocalypse, but it'll work on snow too. [Bubble transition to Plankton in the vehicle, setting up the GPS.] Plankton: We'll take the Pacific to the Arctic, then over ice and snow to the North Pole. Easy-peasy, Santa-squeezy. [chuckles, then sees SpongeBob and Patrick laughing in their seats] Plankton: [unamused] Seat belts. [puts on seat belt] SpongeBob: Of course, [puts on seat belt] safety first. All secured, Captain Plankton. Patrick: [stretches pants onto his body] All secured. Plankton: [groans] I'm already regretting this trip. [Plankton hits a button on the control panel that says \"BLAST OFF!\", and the vehicle takes off, leaving flames behind. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Plankton are smashed against their seats due to the speed.] SpongeBob: Whee! [laughs] Patrick: Ya-hoo! Mr. Krabs: [humming as he walks to the Krusty Krab, then screams as he notices the vehicle] [Mr. Krabs runs away from the vehicle as it drives past the Krusty Krab. He then peeks from behind the Krusty Krab. Plankton tries to reach for the steering bars, but fails. The vehicle jumps over some hills, then Plankton successfully grabs the steering bars and pulls them back, making the vehicle fly into the air.] Plankton: We did it! [looks away] Hmm? SpongeBob: [looking down at the kids at a playground waving at them] Oh, look at those tiny little fish. SpongeBob and Patrick: [waving] Hi! Plankton: Hey, [points] get back to your seats! Patrick: [points upwards] The seat belt sign is off. Plankton: [looks above to see the seat belt sign turn off, and groans] Farmer: [looking up at the flying vehicle, gasps, runs away] The visitors, they're here! SpongeBob: [looking outside with Patrick] He seemed happy to see us. Oh! [sees a fish sitting in a floating lawn chair held by balloons, as he sips his tea] Ah! Patrick: Whoa, a flying lawn chair. Plankton: [rolls eye] [The scene turns to nighttime. Plankton stretches himself and cracks his neck. SpongeBob breathes on his present and wipes it with a cloth. Plankton jumps up to snatch the gift.] SpongeBob: Hey! Plankton: Give me that. [shakes present] What's in this box anyway? SpongeBob: It's a surprise. [takes back present, twists his eye like a combination lock, and puts the present back inside himself] Plankton: I hope it's a stink bomb for that pot-bellied jingle joker. SpongeBob: Santa is not pot-bellied. He just suffers from seasonal bloating. Plankton: [waves and walks off] Right. [walks to a bed] I'm going to sleep. SpongeBob: [gesturing to vehicle] But who will fly this thing? Plankton: [in bed] I put it on automatic pilot. You and that pink moron can sleep on the floor. [Patrick is snoring on a newspaper bed. SpongeBob takes out his present and uses it as a pillow, and takes one of Patrick's newspapers to use as a blanket. Plankton claps twice to make the light go out. Cut to a first-person view of Plankton, who wakes up to see SpongeBob and Patrick in the front seats.] Plankton: Hey, what are you imbeciles doing? SpongeBob: We found the North Pole. Patrick: It was way closer than you said. Plankton: North Pole? Impossible. [looks outside] How long was I asleep? Patrick: [as vehicle approaches the ground] Funny how the ground keeps getting closer. [The vehicle bumps into a sign that says \"Christmas Land Theme Park,\" and a branch falls off.] Speaker: [on sign] Welcome to Christmas Land Theme Park. Where every day is Christmas. Plankton: [jumping onto control panel, pointing to Patrick] Hey, get out of my seat. [both look up to see the seat belt icon come back on] Patrick: The seat belt sign is on. [grabs Plankton and straps a seat belt to him in a seat, choking him] Cabin crew, prepare for landing! [starts pressing random buttons] Plankton: [afraid] Do you actually know how to land? Patrick: I know how to crash land. [Patrick tugs on the steering bars, making the vehicle do flips in the air as it begins nosediving.] Plankton: [grabbing onto seat belt] My seat belt! [gets stuck inside seat] [The vehicle stops nosediving and starts to land, and lightly taps on a pole, causing a giant explosion. SpongeBob and Patrick uncover their eyes and look up to see a \"North Pole\" sign.] SpongeBob and Patrick: The North Pole! SpongeBob: [off-screen] We made it! Plankton: [on windshield, groans, sliding off] Huh? [points to busted navigation system] Look what you two broken brain buffoons did! You completely destroyed the navigation system. Patrick: You're welcome. SpongeBob: Don't be mad, [puts fingers in Plankton's mouth to make him smile] Plankton. We're here. [Plankton's mouth flops downwards. Bubble transition to the trio outside in water helmets.] SpongeBob: Look at all this. [he and Patrick laugh as they run across the snow, looking at their surroundings] Plankton: [concerned] Hmm. SpongeBob: [giggles, looks at garden gnomes] Ooh, Santa's elves! Patrick: [both gasp, looks at taxidermy deer] Santa's reindeer! SpongeBob and Patrick: This is amazing! Plankton: Something's wrong here. It isn't even cold. And look at this smog. Patrick: [looks at the sky] It's snow and smog? SpongeBob: It's \"snog.\" [both laugh, bang their heads together, and wander off] Plankton: [sighs and groans] [With Patrick nearby, SpongeBob hops onto an empty box to look inside a building window.] SpongeBob: Santa's workshop! [Patrick hops onto the box] [Inside the building, there are toy elves \"making\" toys on a conveyor belt.] Toy elves: ♪ Making toys, work, work, work! Making toys, work, work, work! ♪ SpongeBob: [bangs on window] Hello, Santa's elves, I'm SpongeBob! Merry Christmas! Toy elves: [distorted voices] Make, work-- [one of their heads falls off, and another breaks it with a hammer] make, work-- Plankton: [unamused, SpongeBob frowns] Looks like Santa's gone all in for automation. SpongeBob: Hey guys, look! [approaching sign on post] It says, [gasps] \"meet Santa Claus!\" [brief shot of the Santa Claus house up ahead, starts taking off] Come on, guys! [giggles] Patrick: [running after SpongeBob] Let's meet Santa! Plankton: [walking and grunting] [Plankton climbs up a step and arrives to the front of the building. SpongeBob and Patrick are already there, with SpongeBob holding his present.] SpongeBob: We're finally here, little present. [all start walking] Plankton: Guys, I hate to say this, but this place is a sham. I don't know why, but we're being tricked. SpongeBob: Oh, Plankton, Christmas is about believing. Patrick: Yeah, Christmas is about bleeding, man. [SpongeBob and Patrick look down a messy corridor to see a snoring Santa.] SpongeBob and Patrick: [gasp, look at each other, then run to Santa giggling] Plankton: I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eye. The bearded weirdo in the flesh. [SpongeBob and Patrick jump onto Santa's legs. They both start giggling at him, then look at each other.] Santa: [waking up] What would you like for Christmas? SpongeBob and Patrick: [both speaking at once] SpongeBob: [overlapping Patrick's gibberish] Oh, besides peace on earth, I'd like a new luxury three-story shelf for Gary, a lifetime supply of ice cream for Patrick, and... Santa: Pipe down, children. [first person view of him focusing his eyes on Patrick and SpongeBob] What the-- [gasps] SpongeBob SquarePants? SpongeBob: [waving] Hi, Santa. Santa: Did you know that I'm your biggest fan? SpongeBob: Oh, that's very sweet of you Santa, but actually Patchy the Pirate is my biggest fan. Santa: Ho, ho, ho! [Santa takes his head off to reveal he is actually Patchy the Pirate.] Patchy: Ahoy, SpongeBob and Patrick! It's me, Patchy the Pirate. [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp before their heads disintegrate into confetti.] SpongeBob: Patchy the Pirate? You're Santa? Patchy: No, I just play Santa here in Christmas Land Theme Park. [chuckles] It's me side-hustle. Plankton: Heh. I knew this wasn't the North Pole. Patchy: North Pole? No, man, this be Encino. You're almost 4,000 miles from the North Pole. Plankton: [growls, hops onto chair] I'm gonna destroy you two! [crosses arms] SpongeBob: 4,000 miles? Oh, if only our GPS wasn't busted. Patchy: Ooh, I can help with [pulls out map] global positioning. Way before GPS, pirates used these things called maps . [rolls up map and gives it to SpongeBob] Oh, and you'll need a compass too. Potty: [squawks, carrying compass] Happy holidays. [drops compass onto Plankton, crushing him, laughs with Patchy] Plankton: [raising fist] Polly want a smacker? SpongeBob: Well, thanks, Patchy. Guess we'll be on our way. [he, Patrick, and Plankton leave] Patchy: Goodbye! Good luck. If you see Santy Claus, tell him I want a new parrot. Potty: [squawks, pecking Patchy on the head] Patchy: Hey! Potty: And I want a new pirate. [A map of the United States is shown, with Encino labelled on it. A dotted line extends from Encino and into an oil silo. A drop of red ink falls from the silo and continues along the map, and into an alligator near Florida.] Plankton: [echoed voice] Wait, where are we? [All three scream as the red ink dot is spat out by the alligator onto a different part of the map. It goes into a trapdoor and out another one, gets carried by a tornado, goes next to a lumberjack moose, which kicks the dot to the North Pole, where it cuts to the vehicle finally arriving. Plankton is in an ice block, shivering.] Plankton: [shivering] S-S-Santa's workshop, dead ahead. SpongeBob: [now icy and blue, shivering] J-j-just in time. I'm f-f-freezing. Patrick: [now blue, tired] Are we there yet? [eyes crumble from his face] [The vehicle finally arrives at a building in the North Pole. SpongeBob and Patrick get out, and Patrick is licking Plankton stuck in an ice block.] SpongeBob: How you doing with that Plankton pop? Patrick: I can't wait to get to the chewy middle. [close-up of Plankton in the ice block] Plankton: [groaning] [They stand on the welcome mat, and SpongeBob gets excited.] SpongeBob: Hey Patrick, where's Plankton? Patrick: [shrugs] I don't know. Plankton: [opens Patrick's mouth and escapes, putting his helmet back on] [points at Patrick] Eat a breath mint, trench mouth. SpongeBob: All right, here it goes. [knocks on door] Female elf: [opens door] Huh? [looks down] Aw, you guys look great! I like your spaceman helmets. But it's not Halloween for another three months. SpongeBob: [shakes head] We're not here for Halloween, we're here for Santa. [Patrick nods] Plankton: I've got my own agenda so this is where we part company. [puts on elf hat and begins walking] Female elf: Oh, sorry, Santa's not home. He's in Aruba with the Missus. But... [gives SpongeBob and Patrick candy canes] here you go anyway. Patrick: [eats candy cane, which makes him dazed] SpongeBob: [bites candy cane] But--but-- Female elf: Happy Halloween! [slams door] SpongeBob and Patrick: [notice something] Huh? [In the window, figures are seen partying inside the building. Patrick climbs up on the window, and they both peek inside to see the elves partying.] SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa! SpongeBob: [gasps] [Inside, Plankton tries to dodge the dancing elves. He gets kicked into the air and gets back up with a black eye.] SpongeBob: Hey, that's Plankton. He's inside. Patrick: Hmm? SpongeBob: [knocks on window glass] Plankton: Eh? [sticks tongue out] Bleh. [walks off] Jeez. SpongeBob: I have to get Santa's present under his tree. We've got to get inside. Patrick: [eyes turn into lightbulbs] Ah! I'm on it! [runs off] SpongeBob: Hmm, I know! We'll go in Santa style. [gestures downward] Down the chimney. Patrick: [driving a wrecking crane] Oh, fine, we'll go with your idea. [Cut back to Plankton, who is walking by some stables.] Plankton: Hmm, now where in Kris Kringle is Santa's mainframe? [He sees some muscular reindeer working out inside a room.] Plankton: [continues walking] No mainframe, just lame brains. [stops before Santa's workshop as he hears a reindeer talk to him] Bludolph: Yo, where do you think you're going? Plankton: [high-pitched] Who, me? I'm just a little elf! Bludolph: [sniffs] You don't smell like no elf. Plankton: Oh, yeah? What's it to you, [kicks snow into reindeer's face] you moose? Bludolph: [snorts] Hey! Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen! Plankton: [whimpers as the reindeer surround him] Well, looks like we got a whole Christmas special here. [gets picked up by Bludolph] Whoa! Bludolph: Ready for some reindeer games? Plankton: Eh, peace on earth? [the reindeer begin to kick him around] Whoa! Oof, oof, ow! That better be mud on your hooves. Whoa! [Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick arrive inside the workshop's chimney.] SpongeBob: [gasps as he notices a Christmas tree up ahead] That's it! Santa's Christmas tree. [both giggle as they laugh and run to the tree, until a spotlight shines on them as an alarm goes off] Female elf: [opens door, with other elves, angry] There they are! It's the trick-or-treaters! Male elf: Toy thieves! Other male elf: Christmas crooks! Get 'em! [all run inside] Patrick: [scared] SpongeBob, what do we do? SpongeBob: [panicking] Climb! [both start climbing up the tree] Female elf: [all under tree] They're going up the tree! Don't let 'em get away! [Bludolph notices the alarm outside Santa's Workshop.] Bludolph: We better check that alarm! [gestures inside as the other reindeer enter, all trampling Plankton] Plankton: [gets up, taking off elf outfit, walking weakly inside] I wore you down, didn't I? Yeah. You meat head cari-boobs. [The reindeer arrive at the scene, where the elves are throwing things at SpongeBob and Patrick. Male elf: Toy thieves! [A toy duck hits Patrick, who is hanging onto a garland on the tree. Another toy flies past Bludolph's head.] Bludolph: Yo, elves! What the Father Christmas is going on here? Female elf: We got this under control. Go back to your stables. [throws Rubik's cube at the tree, breaking an ornament] [The elves continue throwing things, and some even climb the tree.] Reindeer: [gets hit with a toy truck, rubs head] Oh! Not cool, elf bros. [picks up another toy truck and throws it at an elf, which hits him and falls onto his head] Other female elf: [growls, then swings from a garland and shouts] Reindeer: [ducks, dodging the elf] Whoa! [The female elf crashes into a wall, leaving behind a giant crack. She falls down and Lego pieces fall onto the ground.] Reindeer: [laughs] Male elf: Hey! [points to reindeer with wooden stake] Not funny. [throws stake, which the reindeer dodges] [The reindeer leaps onto the ceiling fan, and begins spinning] Whoa, whoa! [crushes several elves as he lands, and a toy train comes by to crush his snout] SpongeBob: [looking down] Oh, no, Patrick. It looks like I have sowed the seeds of discontent in the house of Santa. [sees Patrick] Patrick? Huh? Patrick: [dazed, reaching for candy cane on the tree] Candy cane...oh! SpongeBob: [gasps as he notices an elf climbing the tree] Oh... [throws ornament at elf, which breaks on his face] Male elf: [unfazed, cackles, continues climbing] Plankton: [walking by the chaos, and almost gets stepped on by a reindeer, groans] [gasps, seeing Santa's mainframe] Santa's mainframe. I found it! [runs towards it, and begins typing his name on the computer] Thanks to those two idiots causing a distraction, I did it. [wipes hands, walking away] My name is on the nice list. [jumps back down and begins walking away] Now I just gotta be good for the next few months. How hard could that be. He-he-he-- [gets stepped on by Santa] wah! Santa: [in a summer outfit] Oh! What the [raises sunglasses] ho, ho, ho is going on here? [the elves and reindeer look at him] I was kicking back with the Missus in the Caribbean when my silent alarm went off. [The female elf points to the tree, where the male elf from earlier chuckles as he is right next to SpongeBob on a branch.] Male elf: [noticing Santa] Huh? [smiles at Santa] SpongeBob: [waving] Hi, Santa. Santa: SpongeBob? Ho, ho, I should've known! [points to SpongeBob] You're a menace. SpongeBob: [laughs, jumps down onto Santa's hand and pulls out the present] All I wanted to do was leave you this present that you didn't get last Christmas. 213 days late. Sorry! Santa: A present is never too late. Oh, how sweet. Not even the elves or reindeer get me presents. [The elves and reindeer look at each other awkwardly.] Santa: Thank you, SpongeBob. [takes present] Should I open it now? SpongeBob: [jumps onto Santa's shoulder, nodding] Uh-huh, uh-huh! [Santa pops open the present, and grabs the secret formula. The reindeer and elves gasp.] SpongeBob: [off-screen] It's one of a kind. Plankton: [with bottle of glue to fix his helmet, then gasps] The Krabby Patty secret formula? He's giving it to Santa Claus! Forget the list, the formula's right here. I could have it now! [laughing as he climbs up Santa] Santa: [looks down] Huh? Plankton: [jumps and grabs the formula, landing on the nearby table] Santa: Huh? Plankton? [points to him] You're being naughty. Plankton: Santa, [flexes bicep with \"Born to be Naughty\" tattoo] I was born to be naughty. Santa and SpongeBob: [gasp, then grunt] Plankton: [pulls out paper and laughs, muttering as he reads it, then rolls it back up] Um, yeah... [holds out paper] you can have this back. My bad, heh. I mean, good--my good. I'm being nice, not naughty. Santa: Well, read it out loud. Plankton: Uh, that's okay. Santa: Go on, read it. Reindeer and elves: Read it! Plankton: [reading] \"Dear Santa, there isn't a present big enough to express how much joy you've brought to all the children and sea creatures of the world. So this is just a simple thank you note. Thank you. Signed, with love, your pal SpongeBob.\" [The reindeer and elves coo, and Bludolph has an elf in a headlock.] Plankton: You got a typo here. Santa: [tearing up] Oh, how touching. [wipes tear] This is beautiful. Thank you, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: I wouldn't have made it here without the help of [gestures to Plankton] Plankton. He's really not that naughty. And of course, my best friend Patrick. Patrick? Patrick: [dazed, holding some candy canes with his water helmet off] Happy holidays to me! French Narrator: [reading time card] The next Christmas. [Cut to the Krusty Krab decorated for the holidays in the snowy winter. The customers are giving each other presents as Mr. Krabs walks out of the office with Santa hats on his eye stalks, holding a present.] Woman: Aww, here you go! Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Happy holidays, everybody. [gives present to Plankton] Sheldon. Plankton: [opens present and pulls out a lump of coal] Lump of coal. [tosses coal lump into a giant pile of it] SpongeBob: [placing another present next to Plankton] Merry Christmas, Plankton. Plankton: Another lump of coal, no doubt. [opens present and pulls out a letter] What's this? [reading note with a picture of Patchy holding him, Patrick, and SpongeBob] \"Merry Christmas to Plankton! One day you will destroy us all.\" Yes, I will, SpongeBob. Yes, I will. [cackles, then grabs a shovel to scoop up the coal to put into a giant robot] Destroy! Robot: [roars, releasing fire] [Cut to an open shot of the Krusty Krab.] Plankton: [off-screen as the windows flash red] Ho, ho, ho! [cackles, everyone else screams as the camera pans upwards]",
