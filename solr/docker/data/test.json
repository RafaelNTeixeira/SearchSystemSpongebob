When he arrives, he throws his unicycle away under the assumption that he will definitely pass and no longer need it. Having taken the oral exam 37 times before, SpongeBob is able to answer most of the questions before Mrs. Puff even asks them. However, upon reaching the driving portion, SpongeBob gets nervous and quickly loses control of the boat, crashing into a lighthouse and causing Mrs. Puff's body to inflate.Later that night, SpongeBob complains about his failure to Gary, who asks him to go for a walk, which he declines. Patrick is then heard talking to him from a walkie-talkie under his covers. He asks SpongeBob to head to his library for a \"surprise,\" and SpongeBob finds Patrick wearing his clothes and calling himself \"Patrick SquarePants.\" SpongeBob is too depressed to laugh at this, and explains his problem to Patrick, mentioning that he needs someone to help him \"think straight\" during the driving test. Patrick quickly devises a plan. Using a cowboy hat to hide the antenna, he puts a walkie-talkie inside SpongeBob's head so he can offer advice.The next day, SpongeBob goes back to take the test again. When asked to start the boat, he initially panics, but Patrick's instructions keep him calm. Just after SpongeBob puts the boat in drive, he almost floors the pedal, but Patrick stops him just before his foot touches the pedal. Patrick then tells him to use his big toe on the pedal, and SpongeBob's toe pops out of his shoe to gently press the pedal. This is followed by a montage of SpongeBob acing the exam, interspersed with shots of Patrick eating SpongeBob's food, and reading his diary while helping him.Mrs. Puff is floored by SpongeBob's sudden improvement and jokingly suggests that his success is due to an antenna under his hat through which \"some guy miles away from here\" is giving him all the answers. SpongeBob (and Patrick) finds this hilarious until Mrs. Puff tells SpongeBob it would be cheating to do so. Upon realizing he has been cheating, SpongeBob goes into hysterics, followed by Patrick. Devastated and ashamed about what he has done, Patrick flees to his house, crying. SpongeBob starts driving wildly all over the course and sobbing, while Mrs. Puff, in a panic, tries desperately to stop him. SpongeBob is too distraught to listen and crashes the boat, failing the test and causing Mrs. Puff to inflate once again. As the episode ends with SpongeBob leaving boating school, he finds Gary riding his unicycle. SpongeBob rides off on it, with Gary atop his head, and happily rides off to visit the hospital, thus ending the episode from there.","musics":["Menace from the Deep","Dramatic Impact (6)","Terminal Pursuit (C)","Hello Blues","Hawaiian Cocktail","Aloha Oé","Side Drum [#52.07]","Real Western Steel","Sailor's Waltz","Quiz Organ (B)","Aloha","Rocket Sled to Oahu","Knuckleduster","Cream Pie","Hawaiian Adventures aka SpongeBob Theme","Apalachian Banjo Duel","Aggressor","Martial Links","Point of Departure K","Hawaiian Train","Botany Bay (b)","Dangerous B","Seaweed 3"],"transcript":"[The episode begins with an aerial view of Patrick's, Squidward's, and SpongeBob's houses in the morning. The camera zooms in to SpongeBob's. SpongeBob is snoring in his bedroom until the foghorn alarm goes off at 7:00.] SpongeBob: [puts way his blanket] This is it, Gary! Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob's bed bounces up and flings SpongeBob onto the calendar, where he lands on March 3rd with the words \"boating exam today!\" on it then drops to the floor] SpongeBob: The big boating exam is today! I've never felt so capable! [A door opens from underneath him. He comes out of his house riding a unicycle] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. Squidward! Squidward! Squidward: What? SpongeBob: I'm ready, Squidward! [rides his unicycle around Squidward's house] Squidward: Ready to move? SpongeBob: No, I'm ready to pass my boating test.

I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. [jumps around the boardwalk. Camera goes inside the school as Mrs. Penelope Puff, a female pufferfish, looks out the window and sees SpongeBob jumping around.] Mrs. Penelope Puff: [sighs] I'm not ready. [opens the door] SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff! Today is the day I'm going to pass my boating exam! Mrs. Puff: [with a clipboard and a pen in hand] We'll see about that, SpongeBob. First we must... SpongeBob: First I must pass the oral exam. I am confident in my abilities to successfully succeed. Mrs. Puff: I know. Okay, number 1: What is the front of the boat? SpongeBob: The bow. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answer] Mrs. Puff: What is the back? SpongeBob: Stern. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answer] Mrs. Puff: Number 3: Right is... SpongeBob: Starboard. [answers the remaining questions] Port. Skipper. Deck. Cabin. Galley. Keel. 1924. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answers] Mrs. Puff: You've passed the oral test. [sarcastically] What a surprise. [gets in the boat and secures herself tightly] Now it's time to once again take the driving portion of the exam. Okay, SpongeBob, get in the boat. SpongeBob: Oh, in this boat right here? [looks at his watch] Is it time already? Mrs. Puff: Get in the boat, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Oh yeah, absolutely. [gets in and closes his eyes with a smile] Mrs. Puff: All you have to do is get on the track. [SpongeBob's eyes spring open in awe; he looks ahead to the track that gets longer and longer in delusion] Mrs. Puff: Okay, SpongeBob, what's the first thing you do? SpongeBob: 1924...? Mrs. Puff: No, no. First thing is to start the boat. [turns the engine on and SpongeBob goes crazy] SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Relax, it's only the boat. SpongeBob: The boat? Mrs. Puff: Okay, now what do you do next? SpongeBob: Floor it? Mrs. Puff: Yes... no! No, don't floor it. SpongeBob: Floor it?! Mrs. Puff: No, no, don't, don't floor it! SpongeBob: Okay, floor it! [SpongeBob slams on the accelerator and starts driving backwards really fast] Mrs. Puff: No! No, no, no, nooooo! [the boat whizzes by some spectators before crashing into a lighthouse. After crashing, Mrs. Puff inflates to three times her size. The lighthouse falls, and Mrs. Puff speaks with a deep voice] Oh, SpongeBob, why? Fred: My leg...! [The scene fades to SpongeBob's home at nighttime.] SpongeBob: [in his bed] I don't know why, Gary. I don't know. I'm tired of failing that boating test. I've already taken it 37 times. Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Okay, 38. [puts his pillow on his head] Gary: [puts on SpongeBob's boots] Meow. SpongeBob: No, Gary, I'm not walking. Patrick: [over walkie-talkie in SpongeBob's bed] SpongeBob, this is Star Ranger, over. SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] What is it, Patrick? Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] I got a surprise for you. SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Oh, Patrick, I'm not in the mood. Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Get out of bed. [SpongeBob gets out of bed] SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, now what, Patrick? Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Go to your closet for a surprise. [SpongeBob slides down a room and stands up in front of his closet door] SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, I'm at the closet. Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Listen carefully. What's pink and square at the same time? SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] I don't know, Patrick. [opens the closet door, revealing Patrick wearing SpongeBob's clothes] Patrick: Patrick SquarePants! SpongeBob: [deadpan] Pat, don't do that. [sits in a chair] I've got too much to worry about. Patrick: What's the problem? SpongeBob: I can't pass my boating exam. I've taken it 37... Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: ...uhh, 38 times. I know all the answers... [Patrick's square pants rip off] ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight. Patrick: Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I'll do all the thinking for you. [takes SpongeBob's walkie-talkie] SpongeBob: How are we going to do that? [Patrick puts a walkie-talkie into SpongeBob's head with the antenna coming out of the top] Patrick: Come in, SpongeBob. Hello? Hello? SpongeBob: Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers. [notices the antenna sticking out] Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head? [Patrick puts a tall hat over the antenna. The scene changes to a big telescope peeking out SpongeBob's upstairs window] Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Pat to Sponge, Pat to Sponge, testing, testing. [looking through the telescope at SpongeBob] Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing! [loudly] Testing! [screams] Test, test! Do you read?! SpongeBob: Sponge to Pat, I read you loud and clear, over. Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Got your apple ready? [SpongeBob shows an apple] Lucky undergarments? Hold on. Hold on. [focuses in on the underwear with the telescope to reveal the word lucky on the top of it] Bingo! Underwear, apple, and me. You're ready to get that license. Uh-oh, here comes Mrs. Puff! Act natural. [SpongeBob jumps out of the boat, then gets on the ground on all fours and starts chewing grass.] SpongeBob: [Moos like a cow] Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] No, no, get in the boat! [SpongeBob jumps in the boat. An ambulance arrives with its siren on and drops off Mrs. Puff] Give her the apple. [SpongeBob gives her the apple] SpongeBob: Here you go, ma'am. [Mrs. Puff throws apple in her mouth and swallows] Mrs. Puff: Let's get this over with. [takes a deep breath] What's the first thing you do? [puts hands and arms over head for protection] SpongeBob: [starts to get scared] Uhh... Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Start the boat. [SpongeBob starts the boat. The engine starting up causes Mrs. Puff to go crazy] SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff: Whoa-ho! Huh? What? SpongeBob: It's okay, it's only the boat. Mrs. Puff: The boat? You started the boat? SpongeBob: I... I think so. Mrs. Puff: Oh. Well... what's the second thing you do? SpongeBob: 1924? Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] No, no, put it in drive. SpongeBob: Put it in drive? Mrs. Puff: Yes, yes, yes! [SpongeBob pushes lever down to drive] Put it in drive. Then what? SpongeBob: [lifts leg up] Floor it? Mrs. Puff: No! [screams] No! Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Freeze, mister! [SpongeBob stops] Big toe. [SpongeBob's big toe pops out of his shoe and gently pushes the accelerator down] Mrs. Puff: Oh, gracious. Oh, gracious! Oh-oh. Ha-ha! Ah, we haven't crashed yet. Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, you're coming to your first turn. [a giant wall with the word wall on it is shown and a left curve] Mrs. Puff: Oh no, the first turn. Please, tell me you know what to do at the first turn! Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Left. [SpongeBob turns left] Mrs. Puff: Oh! Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Right. [SpongeBob turns right] Mrs. Puff: Oh! My, this is splendid, SpongeBob. You're doing fine. Montage: [SpongeBob stops at a stop sign and looks both ways before starting to drive again. Then drives around with his left arm out making a signal. Patrick still talking to SpongeBob through the walkie-talkie as SpongeBob drives over a big hill in the road. As Mrs. Puff writes a couple things on her clipboard, Patrick is putting on another pair of SquarePants. SpongeBob pulls back on the boat and the boat jumps in the air over a big anchor. Patrick finds SpongeBob's diary and begins to read and laugh at it as SpongeBob jumps off a ramp through a ring of fire. Fred is walking across the course but SpongeBob stops the boat and helps him walk across. He gets back in the boat as Patrick is eating a sandwich out of SpongeBob's fridge. SpongeBob is sitting back and driving with his feet and driving upside down.] Mrs. Puff: Splendid! Wonderful! [sign that reads finish line is just ahead] There's the finish line. It's unbelievable. You've shown the most spectacular improvement of any student I've ever seen. What's your secret? A little radio in your head? [everyone laughs] Oh, and under that hat is some kind of, uhh, antenna? [everyone laughs again] And some guy miles away from here is giving you all the answers? [everyone laughs a third time] Oh, yes, but that would be cheating. [SpongeBob opens his eyes wide realizing he is cheating; only Patrick laughs] Patrick: Cheating! [laughing hysterically] SpongeBob: I'm cheating?! Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff: Yes, my star pupil? SpongeBob: I think I'm cheating. Mrs. Puff: What's that, dear? [SpongeBob takes a hold of Mrs. Puff] SpongeBob: I think I am cheating! Mrs. Puff: You've... you've let go of the wheel. SpongeBob: I do have an antenna under my hat! [shows the antenna under his hat] There is a guy giving me all the answers! It's all true! [crying] I'm cheating! I'm cheating! I'm cheating! Patrick: What?! [runs out of SpongeBob's house and back under his rock, crying] SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry! Mrs. Puff: [panicking] The wheel, SpongeBob! The wheel... SpongeBob: Cheating... I'm a cheater! Cheater! Mrs. Puff: No, no, no! It's quite alright! You can cheat that way! SpongeBob: No, I'm cheating! Mrs. Puff: That way, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: I'm cheating! Mrs. Puff: Cheat that way! That way! SpongeBob: I'm a cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater! Mrs. Puff: It's okay to cheat today! SpongeBob: No! Mrs. Puff: That way! That way! Cheat that way! SpongeBob: Cheater...! [crashes offscreen head-on into the same lighthouse. Mrs. Puff inflates with a look of despair. The lighthouse falls yet again] Mrs. Puff: [deep voice] Oh, SpongeBob, why? SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I think I cheated. Fred: My leg! [The scene fades to black, then changes to some time later, as EMTs are wheeling a still-inflated Mrs. Puff away on a gurney.] SpongeBob: Uhh, I'm sorry for letting you down again, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: [normal voice] It's okay, SpongeBob. You didn't mean it. Okay, boys, take me away. [EMTs shove Mrs. Puff into the ambulance] SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'll try harder next semester. [Mrs. Puff cries as she is taken away by the ambulance] It'll be great! [walks away] Only now I don't even have my bike. Gary: [with SpongeBob's unicycle] Meow. SpongeBob: Gary! My bike! You found it! This sponge is still mobile! [rides away on his bike with Gary on his head] Alright, let's go surprise someone at the hospital!

Krabs","Sea urchins","Pioneers","Swordfish trucker","Customer"],"synopsis":"It’s closing time at the Krusty Krab, and Squidward answers a last-minute phone call from a customer. Just as he is about to tell the customer the restaurant is closed, Mr. Krabs suddenly appears and snatches the phone from Squidward's hands and answers it himself. The customer tells Mr. Krabs that he wants to order a pizza and have it delivered, which Mr. Krabs happily agrees to knowing he'll make extra money out of it. Squidward protests this by saying that the restaurant doesn't serve pizza nor do they do deliveries, but Mr. Krabs spontaneously makes a pizza out of Krabby Patties and forces Squidward and SpongeBob to deliver it.After SpongeBob does a vehicle inspection on a boatmobile, Squidward tells him to drive. However, SpongeBob says he cannot as he still in boating school and doesn't have a license, but Squidward says that he doesn't want to drive either and tells him \"it's just around the corner\" and to \"just do what you do in school.\" As expected, SpongeBob becomes increasingly nervous when trying to shift the boat into reverse and, after an annoyed Squidward yells at him to \"back it up,\" he finally panics and ends up reversing the boat for miles and miles until the boat stalls in the middle of a big desert. Thinking the boat has run out of gas, Squidward complains about their predicament and eventually kicks the boat out of frustration when SpongeBob says the pizza is getting cold. This causes the boat to suddenly start back up and drive off unoccupied, leaving the two stranded and forced to continue the delivery on foot.Throughout the journey, the duo encounters numerous mishaps. First, SpongeBob tries a pioneer trick he claims to have seen in a movie where he listens to the ground and hears a truck coming. When SpongeBob tries to get the driver's attention by doing a strange dance in the middle of the road, the driver speeds up and Squidward pushes SpongeBob out of the way so he does not get mowed down. Later, the pizza box becomes caught in heavy winds and SpongeBob refuses to let go of it even after a tornado forms and sucks both him and Squidward into it. However, the pizza actually saves their lives when it turns into a parachute.Upon landing on solid ground, Squidward panics when he notices the road they were following is nowhere in sight. SpongeBob notices a rock with moss on it and suggests they go in the direction where the moss is pointing, saying that \"moss always points to civilisation\" (another pioneer trick he learned). Refusing to follow SpongeBob's tip, Squidward goes in the opposite direction, unaware that the moss was actually directing them to a nearby city.Much time passes, and the two become tired and hungry, so SpongeBob suggests eating coral like the pioneers did. But while SpongeBob tries to remember if it was actually sand or mud, an exasperated Squidward demands to eat the pizza, having given up hope on delivering it. The two then begin arguing over it with SpongeBob insisting it still be delivered, and after a brief chase, Squidward prepares to take the pizza by force. However, SpongeBob becomes overjoyed when he notices a giant rock nearby and, after exclaiming that the pioneers had driven them for miles, says that they can ride it out of the desert. Finally fed up with the pioneer tricks, Squidward tells SpongeBob to forget about them as there are no pioneers left due to their unusual travelling methods and eating habits. But after SpongeBob runs him over with the rock (revealing they can be driven after all), Squidward changes his mind and the duo proceed to ride the rock all the way to customer's house.Unfortunately, their journey doesn't pay off very well. The customer is happy for a brief moment when he receives his pizza and after realizing that he didn't receive the drink he asks where it is. SpongeBob, confused, checks his order and it looks as if he didn't order a drink (though it's likely that Mr. Krabs hung up before the customer finished his order, or he didn't hear that part of the order, or he didn't care about hearing the customer's long babbling because he wanted the delivery to be done, or the customer assumed he would get one). Angry by this, the customer abusively berates SpongeBob for not bringing his drink and his poor delivery service before throwing the pizza in his face and furiously slamming the door on him.Squidward, having watched the entire scene is horrified and tries to console SpongeBob, but fails as he falls to the ground crying while absorbing his tears. Outraged at how the customer treated SpongeBob all because of a measly drink (after everything the two went through and the ridiculous and tiresome obstacles they've been in a complete waste of time) a furious Squidward confronts the customer and brutally slams the pizza in the his face as payback for his rudeness towards SpongeBob.Squidward then returns to SpongeBob and cheers him up by saying the customer changed his mind about taking the pizza and \"ate the whole thing in one bite,\" even without the drink. With the delivery finally completed, Squidward asks to be taken home, but a cheerful SpongeBob says they still have time to make it back to work and drives back to the Krusty Krab, which is comically revealed to have been right across the street from the customer's house, meaning the whole journey could've easily been avoided.

SpongeBob falls to the floor and exclaims] Squidward: Hello? Sorry, sir, we're closed... [Mr. Krabs snatches phone] Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, there, Krusty Krab. How could I help you? [customer explains order over phone] Pizza? Mmm… [eyes turn into dollar signs] Of course we have pizza. Squidward: Uh, Mr. Krabs... Mr. Krabs: Our delivery squid will bring it right over. [hangs up, the customer's gibberish continues but gets cut off] Squidward: But Mr. Krabs, we don't serve pizzas. [Mr. Krabs gets a plate of Krabby Patties and smashes them into a pizza. Then he puts it in a box] We don't deliver. Mr. Krabs: We don't deliver, [gives Squidward the pizza] but you do. Squidward: Can't you just get SpongeBob to do it? Mr. Krabs: Great idea!

SpongeBob: Okay, okay! Squidward: Shift into reverse, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Reverse? Oh, yeah, reverse. [SpongeBob imagines the words \"FORWARD\" and \"REVERSE\" turning into Korean writing, 앞으로가 (FORWARD) and 뒤로가 (REVERSE)] Squidward: Back it up! SpongeBob: [shifts gears] Backing up! Backing up! [boat backs up really fast] Squidward: [tries to get the wheel] Gimme the wheel, SpongeBob. Give me the wheel! SpongeBob: Backing up! Backing up! Ba-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ack-i-i-i-i-i-ng up! [They go over a bumpy area with rocks and then they spin around and around and around, screaming. The scene fades into the next morning, as the boat goes over five hills.] Backing up! Backing up! Backing up! Backing up! [boat stops with no fuel left] Backing up. Squidward: Well... you backed up. And you know what? I think we're out of gas. And you know what else? [echoing] We're in the middle of NOWHERE! SpongeBob: And you know what else else? I think the pizza's getting cold. Squidward: [sarcastically startled] And the pizza's cold? Oh, the pizza's cold! Not the pizza! Oh, how could this get any WORSE?!

Squidward: Sure, we're saved. Now give me some pizza! SpongeBob: No, really, Squid, we're saved! We're saved! We're saved! [he jumps in and out of his pants] Squidward: Will you cut that out?! SpongeBob: [to a conga beat, doing a backflip and some push-ups] Saved, saved, saved, saved! [rips himself apart then the two parts go in circles and then they connect again] Saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! [SpongeBob starts doing a conga dance] Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Yes, we are saved! Squidward: That's just a stupid boulder! SpongeBob: It's not just a boulder. [sniff] It's a rock . [cries and hugs the boulder] A rock! A rock! It's a big beautiful, old rock. [climbs up it and rubs it] Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape. Squidward: SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers?! Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae! And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive... [SpongeBob runs over Squidward with the boulder] ...rocks? Hold on there, Jethro! SpongeBob: [they stop outside a (rust-colored version of Tom)’s house] I can't wait to see the look on our customer's face! [rings doorbell, gives a thumbs-up to Squidward] Tom: Yeah? SpongeBob: Congratulations, sir. Your Krabby Patty pizza is here! Tom: Wow, thanks! I've been dyin' for one of these. It... [he frowns, brief pause] Where's my drink? SpongeBob: [confused] What drink? Tom: [in an angry tone] My drink? My diet Dr. Kelp? Don't tell me you forgot my drink! SpongeBob: [checks through the order, and sees no drink listed.] But, you didn't order any... Tom: [yelling furiously] How am I supposed to eat this pizza without my drink?! SpongeBob: But... but... [tears start rolling down his face] Tom: Didn't you ever once think of the customer?! [throws the pizza box at SpongeBob's face] You call yourself a delivery boy?! Well, I ain't buyin'! [slams the door. SpongeBob goes over to Squidward, smiling and trying not to cry] Squidward: Sponge? Sponge? It's okay. Sponge? [SpongeBob drops the pizza, falls over, starts sobbing, and absorbs his tears over and over] Sponge? [SpongeBob continues crying. Squidward becomes furious. He grabs the pizza, stomps towards Tom’s house and pounds on the door] Tom: [answers the door, still angry] Another one?! Look, I told your little friend I ain't payin' for that! Squidward: [Tom’s point of view] Well, this one's on the house! [slams the pizza box in Tom’s face] SpongeBob: [still crying] Did he change his mind? Squidward: [smugly] He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite. SpongeBob: [stops crying] No drink? Squidward: Nah. Now take me home. [jumps up on the rock] SpongeBob: Are you kidding? We have just enough time to make it back to work! [backs up the rock where they are instantly at the Krusty Krab] Squidward: Work?

Mrs. Puff notices that SpongeBob is the only one who has yet to serve as hall monitor. SpongeBob then approaches Mrs. Puff, and after desperately attempting to find another candidate, she is forced to give the hall monitor duties to SpongeBob.After being elected as Boating School Hall Monitor, SpongeBob gives an extremely long speech, which ends up lasting the entire school day (and thus his whole tenure as hall monitor), which puts Mrs. Puff and all of his schoolmates to sleep. Out of sympathy, Mrs. Puff allows SpongeBob to at least wear his uniform until the next day, though privately apprehensive of her decision.However, SpongeBob goes above and beyond the call of duty and decides to become the \"hall monitor\" of the city, with disastrous results. His activities include an atrociously vain attempt to direct traffic, resulting in a massive crash pile-up, and scaring a couple out of their house in the guise of the \"Open Window Maniac,\" with the intention of showing them the \"dangers\" of leaving a house window open. Later, SpongeBob comes across Patrick eating a strawberry ice cream cone and labels him a criminal after Patrick drops the ice cream on the ground.Then, a newspaper boy comes up to SpongeBob and Patrick, and gives them a newspaper with the headline \"Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom.\" SpongeBob looks at the newspaper headline alerting about a maniac causing trouble around town, blind to the fact that he is himself the article's subject. SpongeBob suggests they stop this maniac, which gives a saddened Patrick the chance to, in his words, \"be good\" by becoming SpongeBob's \"deputy.\" They end up getting ice cream twice as part of Patrick's \"ex-criminal\" advice and then decide to split up to find the maniac, communicating using walkie-talkies.Seconds after SpongeBob runs off, two police officers pull up next to Patrick. They ask him if he has seen the maniac, showing him a wanted poster with a picture of SpongeBob, which he at first mistakes for an imagined, separate maniac, and screams with terror at the mere sight of the poster.The cops patiently assure him that it's just a drawing and not the real thing and instruct him to tell them if he has seen the person when they show the picture. Patrick agrees to cooperate, but he keeps screaming whenever the police show him the sketch. Eventually, the cops decide to have a little fun and repeatedly show and hide the picture as Patrick screams every single time. The officers then drive off, suggesting to Patrick that he stays indoors and take the ice cream cone off his head.Soon, night suddenly falls, and Patrick becomes scared. He calls SpongeBob and asks him to return to home. SpongeBob comes back as Patrick finds a poster of the maniac before he sees SpongeBob in the distance across the street under a streetlight. However, Patrick recognizes him as the maniac rather than SpongeBob. He alerts SpongeBob through his walkie-talkie, and SpongeBob attempts to escape the maniac. Everywhere he goes, Patrick tells him the maniac is there, causing SpongeBob to hide in a mailbox for safety. Upon being told that the maniac is also in there, he bursts his arms and legs out of the mailbox, sprinting around the city in a blind panic. In his terrified state, he topples several buildings and crashes through a fence covered in the wanted posters. After seeing a poster from the fence, he finally realizes that he is the maniac who has been reported in the newspaper and is being pursued by law enforcement causing Patrick to scream and run away offscreen.The police arrive to arrest SpongeBob, but Mrs. Puff appears and berates him for causing the destruction of Bikini Bottom. She then explains and confesses the situation to the police, letting out that he is her responsibility. The police interpret this as taking responsibility for the crimes, and she is arrested instead.Sometime later at Boating School, Mrs. Puff is working with the class on their essay while she is being broadcast on TV from jail, until she tells SpongeBob that he needs to see her after class, \"six months from now.\" and the episode ends with a sound of a cell door slamming.","musics":["Menace from the Deep","War Blower","Troop Movement Alt.

[cut to inside the school] Where diligent students learn the rules of the road. Mrs. Puff: Everyone, put down your books, because it's time to pick out the hall monitor of the day! [SpongeBob squeezes his pencil so hard it shoots up into the air] Let's see here. This week's hall monitor will be Bart, Jimmy, no, no, Tina, Ralph, mm... [gasps and shakes nervously] ...SpongeBob...! [SpongeBob moves his desk between two rows] It's Jimmy! Jimmy's the hall monitor. Incidental 27: Mrs. Puff, I've done it already! [SpongeBob moves his desk closer] Mrs. Puff: Ohh... Bill? Bill\/Phil: No way, Mrs. Puff. [SpongeBob moves his desk closer] Mrs. Puff: Uhh, Tina, you're the hall monitor. Incidental 8: Hey, I've done it 3 times already! [SpongeBob moves up closer] Mrs. Puff: B...uh...B-Beth! Student: She graduated! Mrs. Puff: Henry?! [SpongeBob moves closer] Vera?! [SpongeBob moves closer] Clayton?! [SpongeBob is poking Mrs. Puff with his desk as she sighs] Alright, I guess I have no choice. [gulps] The hall monitor of the day is [she sighs] SpongeBob. [SpongeBob launches into the air] SpongeBob: Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall! Mrs. Puff: Okay! Just take the hat and belt. [tries handing him the uniform] SpongeBob: I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First, I have to make my speech. Mrs. Puff: You can't make this easy, can you? SpongeBob: Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: Give me a break. SpongeBob: And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. [sniffs] And furthermore, I will carry out my duties... [clock moves forward in time as SpongeBob continues his speech] ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall! [at this point, almost everyone is dreary-eyed] Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time. [takes out a long roll of paper] \"Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears.\" [the clock has disappeared, and it is now much later in the day. Puff is asleep at her desk] In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform [takes out the hat and belt] and assume my duties as... [puts on the uniform; deep voice] ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff! [walks towards the door then turns around] Oh, and I will be re... [bell rings as all students excitedly run out the door, over SpongeBob] Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, are you okay? SpongeBob: [muffled] I overdid the speech again, didn't I? Mrs. Puff: I'm afraid so. SpongeBob: Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this. [takes off the uniform] I hardly knew ya. [gives the uniform to Mrs. Puff and walks away saddened] Mrs. Puff: Uhh... SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: I can at least let you wear it until tomorrow. SpongeBob: A-hoo! [dives into the uniform] Thanks, Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff: What are the consequences of what I've just done? [Bubble transition to SpongeBob walking down the street, singing somewhat incomprehensibly. He then notices a broken traffic light.] SpongeBob: Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the [deep voice] hall monitor! [directs traffic, with a whistle, to their destination using all sorts of hand gestures, but ends up causing a huge wreck in the end] What would this town do without you, SpongeBob? Fred: My leg! My leg! SpongeBob: [singing] On patrol. I'm on patrol. [notices a house with an open window] Uh-oh, an open window. [peeks through the window and there is a couple eating] Incidental 12: More seaweed medley, dear? SpongeBob: The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example. [jumps through the window and onto their table in a ski mask, screaming as he does so] I'm the open window maniac! [both run out screaming] I hope you learned a valuable lesson! [shuts the window; cut to him walking again] On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol... [gasps as he sees a puddle of pink goo on the ground] Vandals! Another crime. [takes his finger and tastes the pink goo] hmm...strawberry! I must act! [more pink goo falls on his head. He looks up and sees Patrick sitting on top of a wall and eating some strawberry ice cream] Patrick... [looks around for the voice he just heard] Patrick... Patrick... Patrick: My ice cream! It's alive! [screams and throws away the ice cream] SpongeBob: Patrick! Down here! Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, it's you. [ice cream cone is on SpongeBob's face] SpongeBob: Patrick. Come down here. [Patrick jumps down on top of SpongeBob] Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob? SpongeBob: I'm down here. Patrick: Hehe, you look funny! [hops off SpongeBob and pulls him off the ground] Hi, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: That's hall monitor to you! [fixes his shape] Patrick: Sorry, officer. SpongeBob: Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in. Patrick: What crime? [shows him the ice cream that is on the ground] I'm a bad person! [cries] Morty: [high Voice] Extra! Extra! \"Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!\" City paralyzed with fear! [gives one to SpongeBob] [Gruff Voice] Take it, friends. Arm yourselves with knowledge. [runs off] [high voice again] Extra! Extra! Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom! SpongeBob: [reads paper] \"Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wrecks? Break-in?\". Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, [deep voice] the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime? Patrick: [still crying] I wanna be good! SpongeBob: Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority. [Patrick puts the ice cream cone on his head] Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do? Patrick: Hmmm... I'd get an ice cream! [both walk out an ice cream store with ice cream] SpongeBob: Okay, now what? Patrick: Hmmm... [both come out the ice cream store again with ice cream] SpongeBob: This isn't working. [throws his ice cream away] We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies! [takes out two walkie-talkies. Patrick drops his ice cream and happily grabs a walkie-talkie] And now, duty calls! Alright, deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run ‘em out! [SpongeBob runs off sounding like a siren. The police come driving up and stop beside Patrick] Incidental 118: Afternoon, son. Patrick: Hello, brothers. [salutes to the officers, then raises both eyebrows whilst pointing to his cone hat] Incidental 118: Son, we're looking for the maniac. Orange Incidental 118: Have you seen this man ?! [He whips out a poster that says WANTED MANIAC with SpongeBob's picture on it.] Patrick: [screams] It's the maniac! Take him away, take him away! Incidental 118: Calm down, son. It's just a drawing, not the real thing. Now we're gonna show you this picture again, and you tell us if you've seen this guy. Understand? Patrick: Yeah, uh-huh. Incidental 118: Okay. [Orange Incidental 118 shows Patrick the poster again] Patrick: [screams] Horrible! [Orange Incidental 118 removes the poster, bemused. He holds up the poster again. Patrick screams again. Both cops then look at each other and smile slyly. Orange Incidental 118 repeatedly shows and takes away the poster as Patrick screams every single time. Eventually, the cops decide they've had enough fun.] Incidental 118: Stay indoors, son. Orange Incidental 118: And, uhh, take that cone off your head. [both laugh as they drive off] Patrick: [takes out walkie-talkie] SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer! SpongeBob: SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report. Patrick: [over walkie-talkie] I don't wanna be a policeman anymore. I'm scared! SpongeBob: Get a hold of yourself, deputy. Patrick: [over walkie-talkie, sobbing] I wanna go home! SpongeBob: [sighs] Poor rookie. Alright, I'm on my way back. Patrick: Hurry, SpongeBob, I think it's getting... [the bright sky suddenly, becomes dark] ...dark. SpongeBob: Just put on your siren and I'll be right there. Patrick: [imitates siren] Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. [Patrick picks up the poster that the officers showed him earlier. Then sees a darkish figure down the road. It's SpongeBob, but Patrick doesn't realize it; Patrick gasps loudly] Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him! SpongeBob: [over walkie-talkie] Where is he, Patrick? Patrick: [over walkie-talkie] At the intersection of Conch and Coral. [SpongeBob turns his head around to read the street sign that says Conch Street and Coral Avenue] SpongeBob: That's where I am! He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing? Patrick: Uhh, he's just standing there... menacingly ! [screams over walkie-talkie] Get out of there, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams] That's his maniac shriek! He's going to attack! [SpongeBob cries while running around in circles] He's acting all crazy! Run! Uh, hide behind that building! [SpongeBob hides behind the building] No, he's behind that building! Oh, quick, hide behind that street sign! [SpongeBob hides behind the street sign] No wait! The maniac just went behind that sign! Oh, oh quick! Get under the streetlight! [SpongeBob gets under the streetlights] No wait, agh, he's there, too! Run for your life! [SpongeBob jumps inside a mailbox. As he tries to relax, the radio is cutting out] SpongeBob: [over walkie-talkie] Say again, deputy? Patrick: The maniac's in the mailbox! [SpongeBob screams and bursts his arms and legs through the mailbox. He alternates between screaming and crazily jabbering as he runs through four buildings, causing them to topple over and eventually crashes through a fence plastered with wanted posters] SpongeBob: [takes a look at a wanted poster] Huh, this guy's not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick, I'm the maniac! [Patrick screams in the background. Four police cars and several policeman surround SpongeBob] Incidental 118: We'll take that as a confession. [Mrs. Puff appears] Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob SquarePants, there you are! I turn my back on you for one minute and you destroy half the city! You should be ashamed of yourself! [SpongeBob slumps sadly at these words] Incidental 118: You know this guy? Mrs. Puff: Of course I do. I'm the one who gave him the uniform in the first place. He's my responsibility. [the cops glare at her] Uh-oh... [Bubble transition to the next morning at the boating school where the whole class, except SpongeBob, is sleeping. Mrs. Puff is teaching class from jail through the TV] Mrs. Puff: And in conclusion, students: red means stop, green means go. And SpongeBob... SpongeBob: [frowns nervously] Yes, Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: I'd like to see you after class. 6 months from now!

SpongeBob cannot wait to get started and, upon arriving home, prepares his materials and workspace. However, he has trouble thinking of what to write, and gets distracted by seeing his friends playing outside.Time passes as SpongeBob tries to create the right mood for writing. He does some calisthenics, feeds Gary, cleans his kitchen, and takes copious breaks in between. It eventually becomes clear that SpongeBob is only looking for excuses to avoid the essay. Even Patrick points it out when SpongeBob calls to chat with him in the middle of the night.While wasting more time deciding on the proper bread to use for making himself a sandwich, SpongeBob hears a knock at the door and rushes to greet the mailman delivering a package. When SpongeBob attempts to engage in small talk, the mailman cuts him off and suggests that SpongeBob has an essay to write. Suspicious, SpongeBob slowly heads back inside to find a newscaster on TV reporting on SpongeBob's unfinished essay. He soon discovers that many of his possessions, now suddenly alive, are conspiring against him to prevent the completion of his work. Their interference results in SpongeBob getting locked outside without his pants. At that moment, the flame from a candle comes alive and burns his paper and sets fire to his house which, also suddenly alive, begs SpongeBob as it burns to \"Stop wasting time.\"Finally waking up and realizing much of his procrastination was part of a nightmare, SpongeBob looks first at his woefully incomplete essay, then at the clock, marking five minutes before class time. In desperation, he suddenly realizes that everything he did (or imagined doing) up to that point was something that should not be done at a stoplight, and so he quickly writes it all down to fulfill the 800-word requirement.Excitedly bringing the finished essay to school, SpongeBob finds the classroom empty. Mrs. Puff arrives and explains that she tried to call SpongeBob to give him an update. Due to a teachers' convention she must attend, Mrs. Puff has canceled the assignment and will instead take the class on a field trip the following week to see a stoplight. Left behind with his big smile frozen in place (when he realized that he crammed in vain for no reason to complete his assignment), SpongeBob then rips his essay in half before he splits himself in half, ending the episode.","musics":["Stepping into Danger","Raspberry C","Steve's March","Sunny Samoa","Keel Row","Strange Goings-On","Dramatic Cue (E)","Hawaiian Link (B)","On The Beach","Hello Blues","Dance of the Fumblers","Flight in Panic 1","Vibe & Harp Hits","Dramatic Cue (H)","Four & Three","Tympup A","Chief Taravana","Unpreventable","The Plot Thickens","Terror by Night","Mambo Fantastico","Thats It !","Horlepiep"],"transcript":"Mrs. Puff: Okay, class, quiet, quiet! Now get out your pencil and paper and write down the assignment. [class groans] SpongeBob: [leans towards Nat] Did you hear that? We get an assignment! Mrs. Puff: Everyone must write an essay on what not to do at a stoplight. [class groans again] SpongeBob: [Again leaning towards Nat] Did you hear that?! What not to do at a stoplight! Mrs. Puff: In no less than 800 words. [squeals and class groans again] Nat: [acting like SpongeBob] Did you hear that?! 800 words! SpongeBob: Yeah, I know! [Nat frowns] Mrs. Puff: Due tomorrow. And remember class: work hard and no goofing off. [Bubble transition to back at SpongeBob's house] SpongeBob: Okay, Gary, no goofin’ off! I am about to write the greatest essay of all time. Like most great essays, it will be written on paper. Even more important than the paper is [holds up a pencil] the pencil. A pencil as sharp or as dull as I like. Hmm... funny... as my ideas grow, you shrink. [kisses the pencil as little hearts fly out of it] Well, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to write an essay. [looks at window, it's colorful outside] Okay, here we go. What. Not. To do. At. A. Stoplight. Hey this is easy! By SpongeBob SquarePants. Hah! This essay is pure gold! And now pencil, get ready to do your stuff because here we go! [SpongeBob's clock is shown. Several hours pass and he has still only written ten words] Gee, this is harder than I thought... [SpongeBob looks outside where everyone is having fun] Patrick: [applies lotion on Sandy] Come on, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob goes back to his desk] SpongeBob: It should be against the law to have to write an essay on such a super sailorific, sunshiny day! Oh! But I must press onward, because with this pencil, and the completion of this essay, I'll be one step closer to my driver's license! [a live-action drag race is shown. a car hits a wall, tumbles and gets back up] Oh, yeah. This'll be no problemo. Why, I've got plenty of time. It's only six o'clock. Okay, okay here we go, here we go. [struggles to write] I know, I just need to get blood pumpin' in the old noodle. How about some calisthenics? [SpongeBob does calisthenics. While doing it, he recites \"Hup Hoo\" several times, with his nose and eyelashes doing it too.] SpongeBob: I can feel those juices pumpin' now! [moves his chair closer to the table. he does it a lot because of the fun noise it makes. He then laughs] Huh? What am I doing?! I've gotta write that paper! [pushes his chair in] Come on, pencil, make words. Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Gary! Hey, hey, hey, Gary! How's my favorite mollusk? How about you let ol' SpongeBob fix you up somethin’ to eat? Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: What do you mean you're not hungry? Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: I know I have an essay to write! Now come on, Gary. [Grabs Gary by his shell and pours some food he takes up a ladder and fills it to ceiling-level] I've gotta make sure you have your nutrition, Gary, so I'm not leaving until you eat every single bite. [Gary quickly eats it] Gary, are-are you sure you don't want some crème brulée? Or, or some chocolate-flavored algae bits? [steps on Gary's food] Gee, Gary sure made a mess. I can't work on my essay knowing there's a mess in the kitchen. [cleans it up using himself as a mop] Hmm... I might as well clean the rest of the floor while I'm at it. I should get these hard-to-reach places too! And these dishes need to be cleaned! Can't have dirty garbage. [sprays the garbage can] Well, I think it's clean enough now! Why that didn't take too long... and it's only... Ten o'clock?! [horrific sting plays] Ooh... No more foolin’ around! I've gotta get back to work! Okay, Mr. Es-say, I say... prepare to be written! [the graphite tip of his pencil approaches the paper like a diving fighter plane, and finally makes contact with it] I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Yeah... yeah... yeah! And some of these, and some of these... Almost there and... [finishes writing. The pencil is steaming due to the excess force] done. Now lets see how it looks so far. \"The-\" [shows he has only written \"the\" in fancy lettering] Break time! Pacing always helps me think. Let's see, only seven hundred ninety-nine words to go... Think, SpongeBob, think! [looks at the telephone. Cut to Patrick in bed, snoring. The phone rings and he wakes up] Patrick: Who is that? [picks up phone] Hello? SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, whatcha up to? Patrick: Sleeping. SpongeBob: That's really fascinating, are you havin’ a good sleep? Any dreams you'd like to discuss? I remember on the... Patrick: SpongeBob, you and I both know that you're just choosing me as a distraction so you don't have to write your essay. SpongeBob: [gasps] That is-that is not true! I called to have an engaging conversation with you! Patrick: Well, I'm listening. SpongeBob: Uh... Marco! Patrick: Polo! [hangs up] SpongeBob: Yeah, well I gotta get going Patrick, got an important essay to write? [hangs up phone] Sheesh, what a chatterbox. Can't he see that I'm busy? [back to his desk with eraser shavings on his paper] I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper! [swats the shavings away but they float above the paper] Now they're floating around my thinking space. [blows them away] So long, pesky particles! [the shavings float back to SpongeBob. As he struggles to remove the shavings, he swallows one in the process] I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water! [goes to the kitchen and drinks water] That was a close one. Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: What do you mean \"overly dramatic,\" Gary? [rubs his tummy] All that choking sure made me hungry. Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: I can't write on an empty stomach, Gary. I gotta have my brain food! [opens the refrigerator] Now let's see... White or rye bread... or pumpernickel. Gee, I guess it really depends on the meat inside... and the cheese. [doorbell rings] A visitor? For me!? [SpongeBob opens the door to meet Norton the Mailfish] Hello! Norton: Package for Mr. SquarePants. SpongeBob: Great, thanks! So, uh, do you like delivering mail? Norton: It puts bread on the table. SpongeBob: Rye or pumpernickel? [laughs] Norton: Oh, brother.. SpongeBob: So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain... Norton: Don't you have a paper to write? [He walks away] SpongeBob: [Gulps and zooms in on his face] How did he know I'm supposed to be writing an essay? [blipping his eyes and slides back into his house] Realistic Fish Head: In other news, local resident SpongeBob SquarePants only has a few hours left to complete his essay, and yet he continues to goof off. [head sticks out TV] When will he learn? SpongeBob: Hi-yah! [karate chops the TV causing a zap and glass breaking. lights a candle] Chair: Hey, SpongeBob? Over here! Come on, take a seat. Put your feet up and relax. SpongeBob: [gasps and a bell rings and drops the candle that went out and the clock lights up] Oh no! Midnight!

[his pants are missing] Ah! My pants! Pants: Yoo hoo! Down here! SpongeBob: You get up here! I've got to get back to work! Pants: [runs out of SpongeBob's Pineapple to the door] Freedom! SpongeBob: [runs out the door] Stop Pants, you get back here this instant! Paaants... [door closes, SpongeBob yelps, then tries to get back in, but it is locked. He looks in the window. The candle is still lighting. The clock spins, breaks, and comes to life] Snail Clock: [ghostly voice] Time's up, SpongeBob... SpongeBob: [gasps as the candle comes to life] Burning! Fire Wick: Only seven hundred ninety-nine words to go. [laughs sinisterly as he burns the essay] SpongeBob: No! [the fire wick burns his entire pineapple. He screams] What have I done?! [SpongeBob runs around his house, yelling] Help! Help! My house is on fire! [continues running around his burning house with black smoke until it comes to life] SpongeBob's House: SpongeBob, why? Why did you set me on fire, SpongeBob? Why didn't you just write your essay?! Stop wasting time! SpongeBob: [wakes up] Where's my essay? Oh, there you are! [laughs] I must have dozed off. [grabs his paper from his head] Lets see where are we? [holding his paper with a word \"The\" is still there, puts the paper down on the desk] Do I dare look at the clock... [slowly looks at the clock and gasps] It's almost nine o'clock! Class starts in five minutes. How am I gonna write this whole paper in five minutes? How am I supposed to know what not to do at a stoplight? Feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight! [Writing] And making a sandwich, and lighting candles, and drinking water, and calling your friends, and karate chopping the TV, and shootin' the breeze with the mailman, and fallin' asleep... [Bubble transition to SpongeBob running to the boating school] Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! I'm finished! All eight hundred words! I'm finished! Here it is! [goes inside, but nobody is there] Mrs. Puff? Where is everybody? Mrs. Puff: Oh, there you are, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Here you go, Mrs. Puff! Eight hundred words! All about stoplights and what not to do at 'em. Mrs. Puff: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I tried to call you... I have to go to a teacher's convention. SpongeBob: (shouts slightly) But what about my essay!? Mrs. Puff: I decided to cancel the assignment. We're just going to take a field trip to a stoplight instead. See you next week!

His name is Flats the Flounder, and he tells SpongeBob that he is going to \"kick his butt.\" SpongeBob at first assumes him to be joking, but Flats soon makes it clear that he really means to beat up SpongeBob. An extremely paranoid SpongeBob tries to seek help and to reason with Flats, but to no avail.SpongeBob asks Patrick for help, only to learn that he and Flats were buddies back in community college. He then tries to go to Mrs. Puff to help, who talks to Flats and explains to SpongeBob that \"kicking his butt\" means that Flats wants to become his friend, which is obviously not true. He then encounters Flats' dad in a boat and confronts him about his son's actions, only for the latter to go up to his father and threaten him as well, because he said \"Now he's gonna kick my butt!\". SpongeBob panics and sprints away.He eventually runs away into town, where Flats attempts to run him over with a garbage truck, but he eventually drives over a banana peel SpongeBob drops, causing it to flip over. Flats awakens in the hospital, where he learns that SpongeBob saved his life by performing CPR on him for five hours straight.Despite this, Flats continues to pursue SpongeBob; when SpongeBob runs through town and warn everyone about Flats, some people kick an old man's butt who they think is going to kick SpongeBob's butt. The old man was by a bus stop and Harold angrily asks how many times they have to teach him this lesson. Eventually, he corners SpongeBob in his own home, where he proceeds to beat him up.However, due to SpongeBob's spongy body, he absorbs the blows without harm. Flats continues to hit SpongeBob nonstop throughout all of next week, until he finally faints from exhaustion; his classmates cheer for SpongeBob. However, pitying Flats, SpongeBob starts a speech about how violence leads to nowhere, which ends with him making a fist. Just then, Mrs. Puff enters and sees Flats unconscious and SpongeBob making a fist, and believes the latter beat up Flats. Enraged by the disaster, Mrs. Puff shouts to a stunned SpongeBob that she is going to kick his butt before the screen fades to black, thus ending the episode.","musics":["Dramatic Climax","Dramatic Encounter","Dramatic Cue (E)","Dramatic Cue (B)","Marching to Honolulu","Dramatic Cue (D)","Danger Zone","Unease","Hello Sailor (B)","Romance and Rhapsody","Steel Licks 41","Zelle 506","Funeral March","Whisper from the Past [#64]","Flight in Panic 1","Hawaiian Flower","Steel Licks 22","Epic Struggle","Steel Licks 18","Zelle 505","Idea Sting","Chief Taravana","Tales from the Swamp (c)","Horror Chords (b)","Wooden Bear","Unpreventable","Dramatic Stabs","Dramatic Cue (F)","Dangerous B","Thats It !"],"transcript":"[The episode begins at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, where SpongeBob is arranging his pencils on his desk.] SpongeBob: Excuse me, miss? Incidental 7: I don't want to have to report you again. SpongeBob: [laughs] I was just wondering... [points to the 'Homework' pencil while the other two pencils say 'Quiz' and 'Essay'] ...is it the homework pencil on the left side of the paper next to the quiz pencil, or over on the right side all by itself? Or... Incidental 7: I think it goes stuck inside your... SpongeBob: Wait, I got it! The quiz pencil goes right over here next to the essay pencil [moves the pencil] and the essay pencil gets turned sideways toward the notepad, [turns it sideways] just in case I have to write an essay. Mrs. Puff: [walks in] Good morning, class. Sorry, I'm late. I got caught in traffic on the way in here when that whole 'I'm-going-to-be-doing-this-for-the-rest-of-my-life' thing reared its ugly head and I... [everyone stares at her blankly] Anyway, we have a new student starting today, so let's all put on a happy face for Flats the flounder. [opens the door to show a skinny flounder from the front but when he turns sideways, he's large. The entire class, except SpongeBob, are all wearing colorful smiling masks] Tell the class something about yourself, Flats. Flats The Flounder: Well, I like to kick people's butts. Mrs. Puff: [laughs] What a card! Now Flats, it's time to pick your seat. Just go ahead and sit anywhere you'd like. [the class move their desks away from the middle of the room, except SpongeBob. Flats sits in the empty seat next to him] Okay class, as you remember last week... SpongeBob: [to Flats] Hi, I'm SpongeBob! Flats: Hi, SpongeBob. I'm gonna kick your butt. SpongeBob: [gasps, then laughs] That joke was almost funnier the second time. Flats: [leans over SpongeBob menacingly] No. I mean it. SpongeBob: [giggles] That time it almost seemed like... [Flats rips off his chest hair to show a tattoo that says 'I mean it'. Horror-struck] ...you did mean it. [raises his hand] Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: Yes, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Can I be excused for the rest of my life? [Mrs. Puff chuckles] Mrs. Puff: Why no, SpongeBob. I'm in the middle of a coffee-fueled sermon right now. You can't afford to miss this information. SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff. [puts his hand down] Sorry, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: Now, can I please have a volunteer to come up to the board? How about you, Flats? [Flats approaches the board] Please draw for us a diagram of a basic four-way intersection, Flats. [draws an image on the board] Please turn and show the class what you drew, honey. [Flats has drawn pictures of SpongeBob being beat up; SpongeBob yelps in horror] My! How very creative! We have an artist in the class! [everyone applauds, except SpongeBob. Bubble transition to SpongeBob running in the halls and into the bathroom and hides in one of the toilets] SpongeBob: I just don't understand. Why would Flats want to kick my butt? I haven't said two words to the guy! [cut back to SpongeBob saying \"Hi, I'm SpongeBob!\" SpongeBob counts on his fingers] One, two, [gasps] oh no, that's three! What am I going to do? [hears the door open] What was that? Someone's coming. They're getting closer. I've just got to act natural. [Incidental 37B opens the lid and sees a real sponge] Incidental 37B: Oh that's real nice. [walks out] SpongeBob: Phew, I thought for sure that was gonna be... [Flats opens the stall] Flats! Uh, hello, sir. Kick any good butts lately? Yeah, I remember last week, I was kicking this guy's butt real good. And he leans over and says, 'Hey, you know, life's like a bucket of wood shavings. [Flats looks dumbfounded] Except for when the shavings are in a pail, then it's like a pail of wood shavings! [giggles] Flats: Hey, that story really speaks to me. SpongeBob: Really? What's it say? Flats: It says now, I'm gonna kick your butt twice as hard. [leaves SpongeBob who flushes the toilet, making water spray out of his holes. Bubble transition to SpongeBob walking down the hall while writing on a clipboard] SpongeBob: ...and I leave Gary's water bowl to Gary, and my curtains to... oh Neptune, I just can't do this.

[cut back to Patrick's rock] Patrick: Yeah, hey, Mario. Let me get a large double olive, double- [cut back to SpongeBob] SpongeBob: Patrick, listen! It's me, SpongeBob! I need your help! Patrick: [over phone] You're working at Pizza Castle now? SpongeBob: What? No, listen! I'm in big trouble. There's a new guy at school here and he wants to kick my butt! Listen, you're big and strong, do you think you could come down here and maybe rough him a bit? Just to get him off my back? Please, Patrick, I'm so scared, it feels like I'm gonna throw up. Patrick: [over phone] No, they're not closed. I know, you want olives. SpongeBob: Patrick, are you there? Patrick: [over phone] Oh, sorry, SpongeBob. I was just talking to my old community college buddy, Flats. [SpongeBob is horror-struck. Cut to Patrick's rock where Flats is sitting on the couch enjoying a beverage] I bumped into him at the soda store, isn't that funny? [cut back to SpongeBob. The background becomes black except for a white color surrounding SpongeBob; SpongeBob goes to the right of the screen and to the background three times] Well it must have been years since we've seen each other. Well, let me get going. He's got to go back to school soon. He says he's got to kick somebody's butt. [SpongeBob drops the phone and runs away screaming] Hello? Is this Pizza Castle? [cut to Mrs. Puff's room where SpongeBob is still heard screaming then smashes into the door] Mrs. Puff: Come in, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, can I be in a different class? Mrs. Puff: But why? SpongeBob: I can't tell you. Mrs. Puff: Why ever not? SpongeBob: I just can't, Mrs. Puff. My physical being is at stake, let's just leave it at that. Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, you can tell me anything. You've got to believe that. SpongeBob: Well, okay. But only if you promise to keep it between us. Mrs. Puff: Of course. SpongeBob: Flats says he's going to kick my butt! Mrs. Puff: What?! There shall be no butt-kicking in any class of mine! This is an adult program, SpongeBob. Just leave it to me. SpongeBob: Aw, thanks, Mrs. Puff. I knew I could count on you. [Bubble transition to SpongeBob eating a sandwich outside for lunch. The bell rings and everyone goes back in the classroom] Mrs. Puff: Have a nice lunch, SpongeBob? [walks in the classroom] SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: [whispers] SpongeBob, I talked to Flats for you. I used your name. It was all a misunderstanding. SpongeBob: You what?!?! Mrs. Puff: He was never going to kick your butt at all! You see SpongeBob, Flats is from a town where kicking someone's butt means that he wants to be your friend. [Flats makes a SpongeBob out of sand and kicks it] And maybe play some sports with you on weekends. SpongeBob: [nervously] I've got diarrhea! [runs off and sees an older flounder in a boat] Huh? Are you Flats' dad? Mr. Flounder: Why, yes I am. SpongeBob: Okay, see, I didn't know where else to turn! Patrick couldn't help me, and Mrs. Puff only made it worse. I sit next to your son Flats in school, and he is a fine boy and all, and I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but he wants to kick my butt. [Flats is by the boat to confront his father] Flats: Dad, what are you doing? Mr. Flounder: [nervously] Uh, nothing son. Flats: What did I tell you about talking to strangers? Mr. Flounder: [to SpongeBob, frightened] Now he's gonna kick my butt! SpongeBob: [screams in horror and runs away through the whole town] Out of my way! Out of my way! [points] Can't you see he's gonna kick my butt?! [a bunch of fish look over to Incidental 85 the older fish at a bus stop; thinking he was Flats] Incidental 85: Hi there, young people. Nice day today. Harold: So, you like kicking butts, do ya?! Well, we'll show you, old man! [the fish start beating up on Lonnie while SpongeBob is hiding in a garbage can] SpongeBob: Okay, okay, I got to skip town, start a new life, live under an assumed name! \"BobPants SpongeSquare.\" Yeah, that's good. Grow a beard, and then shave it off, and live happily ever after. [Flats is behind him driving a dump truck] Flats: Yeah, except you forgot the part where I kick your butt! [SpongeBob gasps three times and runs off while still in the garbage can, with Flats chasing him. As he is running down the road, trash falls out of the garbage can. Flats chuckles. A banana peel falls out of the garbage can. Flats sees the banana peel on the ground and screams while attempting to slow down, but the dump truck runs over the peel, flipping upside down and crushing him.] Oof! [ Cut to later where Flats is covered with cast in his entire body while lying in a bed in the hospital] SpongeBob: Hey, Flats, you feeling better? Flats: What? Where am I? The Doctor: [walks in] Why, you're in the hospital. This young boy saved your life. He performed CPR for five hours straight. SpongeBob: Yeah. They said you'd be okay after the first few minutes, but I just wanted to be sure. Flats: Wow, I'm touched. I'll have to remember that when I'm kicking your butt. [SpongeBob is thunderstruck, accompanied with glass shattering] Those flowers for me? SpongeBob: [screaming as he runs out of the hospital after bringing flowers to Flats] He's still gonna kick my butt! [the fish look at Lonnie at a bus stop again] Harold: How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man!? Incidental 85: I love the young people! [the angry fish walk up to Incidental 85. Cut to SpongeBob running back to his house] SpongeBob: Oh, Gary! I'm too young to have my butt kicked! There are so many things in life I haven't gotten to do! [cut to SpongeBob in an office building at a desk, on the phone] Hang on, I'll transfer your call. [cut back to a knock on the door] Who is it? [door falls down. SpongeBob sees Flats and screams] Flats! Flats: It's butt-kicking time! SpongeBob: Gary, there's something I want you to know, but I'm too scared to remember what it is. [Flats cracks his knuckles more and more. SpongeBob breathes harder and harder. Flats brushes his teeth and gargles. SpongeBob breathes harder] Flats: Let's do it! SpongeBob: Go away, Gary. I don't want you to see this. It'll be ugly. [Gary gets out a camera from his shell] Flats: Are you ready? SpongeBob: Hold on. [puts a blindfold over his eyes] Okay, I'm ready. [Flats punches SpongeBob, but it doesn't hurt him] I said I'm ready. [Flats tries again but same result happens] Didn't you hear me? I said I'm ready. [Flats punches him again and this time SpongeBob giggles] That tickles. [Flats keeps punching him but nothing seems to hurt SpongeBob] Gary, I'm absorbing his blows like I was made of some kind of spongy material! Do you know what that means? I get to go to work tomorrow! [cut to next day where SpongeBob is in the Krusty Krab kitchen, grilling, and Flats is still punching SpongeBob, then scene cuts to him playing cards with Gary] You have any sevens? Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: [chasing jellyfish, walking out of the bathroom, sleeping, and eating breakfast, while Flats is still punching him. Cut to boating school as SpongeBob is sitting at his desk and Flats is punching, but is now exhausted. He passes out due to exhaustion] Flats, are you okay? [everyone cheers] Do not cheer me, my fellow adult classmates. Flats was the real victim here. A victim of a society that's riding down a violent road to nowhere; a road I call... [clenches fist] ...'violence road'. [Mrs. Puff walks in] Mrs. Puff: Sorry I'm late, class, I... [gasps as she sees SpongeBob's fist and Flats on the ground] SpongeBob! I can't believe you beat up a new student!

He ends up leaving the driving course and wrecking the boating school and the city, before driving off an unfinished bridge and falling into an abyss. The police follow the boat and end up driving off the bridge and into the abyss themselves. SpongeBob, Mrs. Puff, and the police all land on top of a truck full of fruit punch being delivered to Shady Shoals Rest Home, causing it to fall over and spill, flooding the rest home. Although SpongeBob is responsible, the incident occurred under Mrs. Puff's supervision, and she is sent to prison for gross negligence. In prison, she realizes that she will not see SpongeBob again for a very long time, and starts to enjoy it.Meanwhile, SpongeBob is depressed that Mrs. Puff is in jail, and Patrick tells him that it is SpongeBob's fault. The duo sets out to free her from jail. First, they try to rob the bank in order to get arrested themselves, but SpongeBob gets wrapped up in the bureaucratic niceties of banking and forgets they are trying to commit a crime. Next, they disguise themselves as rocks that the prisoners smash as labor. They try to communicate with Mrs. Puff, who calls the guards, but they dismiss her conversation with two rocks as a hallucination and move her to kitchen duty. SpongeBob and Patrick are then smashed by another inmate, costing them their deposit on the costumes. Then they hide in a vat of chili in the cafeteria and offer to help Mrs. Puff escape through it, but she explains to them that she likes it in prison, which SpongeBob refuses to believe. He worries that Mrs. Puff is completely institutionalized in prison and he needs to get her out. In an attempt to coax her, SpongeBob tells Mrs. Puff if she can escape, he will stay after school and decorate the entire classroom, but Mrs. Puff refuses. She calls for the prison guards again and is reassigned again after the prison guards believe that Mrs. Puff is going crazy.SpongeBob and Patrick appear to her yet again on a coat hanger assembly line, and when she calls for a guard, he somehow perceives SpongeBob and Patrick as raw materials used to make the coat hangers and dismisses her to her cell once again. SpongeBob and Patrick then appear in Mrs. Puff's cell toilet, asking her to hop in, and when Mrs. Puff calls for a guard again, he simply flushes them down the toilet and leaves. They then appear in her bed, and Mrs. Puff calls for the guards yet again, but this time the two guards that appear are SpongeBob and Patrick in disguise. After they leave, the real guards show up after hearing her screaming and crying, but Mrs. Puff thinks its still SpongeBob and Patrick in disguise and rips off their faces. This is the last straw for the guards, who strap Mrs. Puff into a straitjacket and throw her in a padded cell for solitary confinement, convinced she's completely lost her sanity. Despite this, she is glad to finally be alone and away from SpongeBob, but suddenly his face appears all over the walls and floor of the padded cell and begins laughing at her.Mrs. Puff screams in horror at the incessant laughing as the scene transitions back to SpongeBob driving off the cliff and crashing into the fruit punch truck, once again flooding the rest home. Mrs. Puff stumbles out of the wreckage and is confronted by the police again, but to her surprise they arrest SpongeBob instead of her. From this, she concludes that her prison sentence was merely a hallucination and is happy that she's not going to jail, but after a police officer informs her that she \"already did [her] time\", Mrs. Puff suddenly sees herself wearing a prison uniform with a chain on her ankle.She once again screams in horror as the scene transitions back to her sitting in the boat going off the cliff again, seemingly having suffered another hallucination, but this time she sees Donna, a prisoner with a masculine voice from her first hallucination, driving the boat instead of SpongeBob. Screaming yet again, the scene transitions back to Mrs. Puff sitting in the boat driving off the cliff, this time with SpongeBob behind the wheel and no police cars behind them. Exasperated, Mrs. Puff says \"oh, forget it,\" immediately closing the episode.","musics":["Keel Row","Steel Licks 47","Steel Licks 78","Lonely Stranger","Danger Zone","Unease","Hawaiian Cocktail","The Crime Busters","Mud","Hawaiian Breeze","Land Of Hope And Glory A - From Pomp And Circumstance No. 1","O Primavera","Surfin' Summer (A)","Epic Struggle","Hail to the Chief A","Fisticuffs","Sugar Beat","Hawaiian Link (A)","Chase That Car","Kamakani B","Springtime for Lovers","Shock","Closing Theme 2","Seaweed 3","Horlepiep"],"transcript":"[The episode starts at the boating school and Mrs. Puff is panicking while SpongeBob is in his driving test again and destroying stuff, as usual.] SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff!

SpongeBob: [while struggling to get back on the road] Gotta pass the test! Gotta pass!

[SpongeBob drives through the ribbon and rips it before he cuts it. The crowd of people that are gathering around the mayor take pictures. SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff do not make it on the other side of the unfinished bridge so they fall to the bottom as Mrs. Puff still screams] Mrs. Puff: Where did I go wrong?! [flashback to Mrs. Puff's first day of her new boating school] With the opening of my new boating school, I pledge that as long as a student is willing to learn, I shall never give up.

Scene then shows a retirement home where a fish in a white coat is yelling at a truck that has fruit punch] Shady Shoals Caretaker: Hurry up with that truckload of fruit punch! The seniors are getting cranky! [fish looks up and notices SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff crashing into the truck] Mrs. Puff: Alive! I'm alive! Oh, thank Neptune, I'm still...! [Suddenly, a Police squad car smashes down on the boat mobile. The other Police squad cars fall on and around the truck and others fall on the ground. The truck falls over on its side as all the fruit punch comes pouring out] Feminine Tom: [inside the retirement home, he is opening windows] Alright, seniors, let's open these windows so the world can see your nice white clothes.

[red punch comes flowing in, making his memoir papers soggy and red] Aww, barnacles! [Scene cuts back to outside where all the mess is] Mrs. Puff: Ow. SpongeBob, are you okay? SpongeBob: That depends. Did I pass? Officer Nancy: Freeze, you're under arrest! Mrs. Puff: Hold it, you can't arrest him! He's just a student driver! Officer Nancy: We're not talking about him! [Scene cuts to nightfall and Mrs. Puff wearing a prison uniform, being locked up in jail from the Bikini Bottom Jail] Mrs. Puff: But I don't belong here! It's all a big mistake! Prisoner Female #1: Yeah, I don't belong here, either! Prisoner Female #2: Me too! I'm innocent! Prisoner Female #3: [yelling in a butch Southern drawl] I belong here! [this triggers some other prisoners to complaining about their not belonging here too. Mrs. Puff walks over and sits down on the bed] Mrs. Puff: Okay. You can do this, Puff. You can get through this without losing your sanity. Oh, that's a road we don't want to go down again. Positives. Think of the positives. Let's see... I've got no more papers to grade. Yeah!

[Scene cuts to her boating school, which is now deserted and dusty, with SpongeBob the only one in the room] SpongeBob: Class just isn't the same without Mrs. Puff. Just the thought of her alone and afraid in jail makes me think about her being alone and afraid in jail. I don't know how she's going to survive. [scene cuts to Mrs. Puff with a happy expression] Mrs. Puff: [hums while breaking rocks. Scene cuts to her making license plates] ♪Smelling the pretty roses, whoo hoo hoo.♪ [scene cuts to her lifting weights] ♪Haaappiness is just two kinds of ice creeeeam!♪ [cuts back to SpongeBob] SpongeBob: Oh, that poor woman. And it's all my fault. Maybe if I go talk to Patrick, he can ease my guilt. [Scene cuts to the outside of Patrick's rock] Patrick: Well, it sounds like it's all your fault. SpongeBob: Oh, you're right! Mrs. Puff's in jail and it's all because of me! I'm such a barnacle head! [Patrick takes one of his dots and puts it in the place of where his nose would be if he had one] Poor Mrs. Puff. I know, I gotta get her out! But to get her out of jail, first we gotta get in jail.

[he is in the bank, wearing a sock over his head, with a bag in his hands, facing the wrong way.] Put it in! Nat: [as a bank teller] Umm, you're facing the wrong way, sir. SpongeBob: [turns around and laughs, then yells again] Alright! Give me the money! Nat: Will that be from your savings or your checking account, sir? SpongeBob: Uhh, savings. Nat: May I please see some identification? SpongeBob: Sure. [takes out a card and gives it to the bank teller] Here ya go. Nat: Thank you. [SpongeBob's Jellyfishers Club Membership card is shown. As the bank teller types on the cash register, SpongeBob lifts up the sock on his head and gives Patrick a thumbs up] ...Sir, we are showing a balance of zero dollars and zero cents for both of your accounts. SpongeBob: Oh. Nat: Next! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk out of the bank] SpongeBob: Well, that went better than expected. Patrick: Yeah! I didn't think we'd get Mrs. Puff out of jail this fast! [SpongeBob's eyes rip through the sock. Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick now disguised as yellow and pink rocks] SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get into jail this time. [a truck full of rocks drives up] Fish: Hey, there's a couple. [gets out and throws the two rocks in the truck] Guard: Put your back in it, girls! [women prisoners are crushing rocks outside. The truck arrives and unloads more rocks] SpongeBob: Look, Patrick, there she is! [both jump over to Mrs. Puff where she is about to hit them] Mrs. Puff, wait, it's us, SpongeBob and Patrick! Mrs. Puff: That's funny. For a second, I thought that yellow rock talked to me. And its voice sounded a lot like... SpongeBob: SpongeBob. It's me, SpongeBob. [Mrs. Puff screams as she throws the pickaxe behind her] We're gonna bust you out of here. C'mon, Mrs. Puff! [Mrs. Puff starts shaking] Mrs. Puff: It's you. What are you doing here? Why did you follow me in here? Why?! [the first guard walks up, with Mrs. Puff's pickaxe in his head] Guard #1: Alright, Mrs. Puff, it looks like this heat's gone to your head. If you're gonna talk to rocks, I guess it's time for you to go on kitchen duty. Mrs. Puff: Yes, it must be the heat. Yes. [walks off] SpongeBob: Darn it! Okay, Patrick, let's get out of here. [a woman prisoner walks over] No, wait! [she smashes the two rocks into pieces] There goes our deposit on these costumes. [scene cuts to lunchtime where Mrs. Puff is serving chili to the prisoners.] Mrs. Puff: There you are. [a woman with a deep voice walks up to Mrs. Puff] Donna: Hey there, Puff Mama. What's today's grub? Mrs. Puff: Hi, Donna. It's chili, same as always. Let me get you some. [scoops up SpongeBob's nose and Mrs. Puff gasps] SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob! Mrs. Puff: When are these horrific hallucinations going to end? [SpongeBob gets out of the chili] SpongeBob: No, it's really me! [pulls Patrick up out of the chili] I brought Patrick along too. Patrick: Hi. Mrs. Puff: Why? SpongeBob: 'Cause we're gonna set you free! Mrs. Puff: No, I mean, why'd you bring him? [Patrick eats some chili] SpongeBob: He likes chili. Now quick, get in before someone sees. [makes a rectangle-shaped entrance in the chili] Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I am not going with you. SpongeBob: [laughs] That's a good one, Mrs. Puff. Now hop in. Come on! Patrick: SpongeBob, I think she means it. SpongeBob: Oh, that's crazy, Patrick. Mrs. Puff: He's right, SpongeBob. I'm staying. SpongeBob: But why? Mrs. Puff: I like it here. These are my people! [cut to a shot of some angry, gruff looking women prisoners] And besides, if I'm in here, that means I won't have to deal with yooou... [we see SpongeBob sad. He is sniffling as a single teardrop falls from his eye, almost crying in the chili] …uranium! In the water supply. [whips out a glass of water] See? Crystal clear! [guzzles the water and tosses away the glass] Aahhhh! SpongeBob: Excuse us just one second, Mrs. Puff. [to Patrick] Patrick, she has lost it! She's completely institutionalized. She's forgotten what it's like to live on the outside. To not be in prison. [Scene cuts to Frankie Billy in traffic, then at his desk for work from the office, and then staring out his bedroom window at night] Frankie's wife: Coming to bed, honey? Frankie Billy: Yes, dear. [Scene cuts back to SpongeBob and Patrick] SpongeBob: We've got to remind her that there is a life other than this. Mrs. Puff, if you come with us, I'll stay after school and decorate the whole classroom. Mrs. Puff: For the last time, no! [SpongeBob and Patrick disappear inside the chili as a guard walks up] I'm not going with you! That's final! [notices the guard] Oh. [laughs nervously] Guard #1: Talking to inanimate objects again, huh, Puff? Hmph. Get back to your cell. No more kitchen time for you. [Mrs. Puff walks off sad. SpongeBob and Patrick watch her. Scene cuts to Mrs. Puff burning coal into wire hangers until SpongeBob and Patrick come down the conveyor belt] SpongeBob: Quick, Mrs. Puff, hop on! Mrs. Puff: Guards! Guards, come quick! [the guard runs over to her] There's a crazed ex-student of mine and his overweight friend here to break me out! Guard #1: That's just raw material used to make coat hangers. You need some rest. [grunts as he pushes the level down, squishing SpongeBob and Patrick, which fills the room up with steam.] [Scene cuts to Mrs. Puff brushing her teeth. SpongeBob and Patrick come up from the toilet] SpongeBob: Psst! [Mrs. Puff screams] Hop in, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: Guards! Guards, come look! [a guard runs over and sees SpongeBob and Patrick in the toilet] Guard #1: Whoa. They don't pay me enough to do this job. [The guard flushes the toilet, sending SpongeBob and Patrick into the sewers. Cuts to Mrs. Puff in her bed. SpongeBob and Patrick peek from the top bunk] SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, up here. Mrs. Puff: Guards, guards! They're back! [two guards walk up] Guard #1: What's all the hubbub, Puff? Mrs. Puff: They're back! [the guards remove their heads, because they're just costumes, showing them as SpongeBob and Patrick] SpongeBob and Patrick: Mrs. Puff, it's us! [both wink and give her a thumbs up] Mrs. Puff: [screams and cries as the two real guards run up] Guard #1: What the barnacle is going on? Mrs. Puff: Get away from me! Get away! Guard #1: What are you talking about, Puff? Mrs. Puff: You can't fool me! You're SpongeBob and that guy who likes the chili. [rips off the guards' faces leaving their skulls shown] Guard #1: Let's face it, Puff. You've gone off the deep end. [Scene cuts to a second guard throwing Mrs. Puff, who is in a straitjacket, in a small, yellow square room] Guard #2: Get in there, you! You need a nice long stay in solitary confinement! [slams the door, which makes a squeaking sound] Mrs. Puff: Oh, well. Let's look at the positives again. I'm finally away from those two. Yes. All alone in my nice, soft room. SpongeBob: Made of sponge! [laughs. The room is made of yellow sponge as SpongeBob's face appears on all sides of the wall. Mrs. Puff screams as the scene goes back to SpongeBob driving in mid-air with the police behind them again.] I can pass the test, Mrs. Puff! I can pass the test! [The boats crash into the truck full of fruit punch, knocking it over, and spilling again] Officer Malley (Green): Freeze! Your joyride's over, punk. [police officers walk over] Mrs. Puff: No! What? [policemen arrest SpongeBob this time, because he now failed the driving test] Huh? What? SpongeBob: No. No! What are you doing?! Help! Help! [As the officers carry him to the jail vehicle, he kicks his legs.] No, no, please! No! I have a snail to feed! I can't go to jail now! This is not a good time! No, please, please! I'm not a criminal! [They throw him into the back of the police car, then drives off to jail] Mrs. Puff: I can't believe it. It was all a dream. I'm not going to jail! Officer Malley (Orange): Why would you go to jail? You already did your time. [zoom out to reveal Mrs. Puff wearing prison striped clothes of black and white with a prison ball chained to her ankle. She screams as the scene goes back to her screaming while the boat is in mid-air again as she's driving it with the police behind her] Mrs. Puff: Huh? Oh... it's just my imagination again. [zooms out to show Donna driving the boat] Donna: So, what's for dinner tonight, Puff Mama, chili? [Mrs. Puff screams again as the scene goes back to her with SpongeBob driving the boat in mid-air one last time, but without the police cars behind them] Mrs. Puff: Huh? What? Huh? Ah, forget it.

SpongeBob declines, but suggests that Patrick come to school with him, to which Patrick agrees. Upon arriving, SpongeBob shows Patrick around and explains their classroom's \"Good Noodle\" system, where stars are awarded to well-behaved students. SpongeBob has by far the most stars of anyone in the class. He also introduces Patrick to Roger, an egg in a terrarium with a lightbulb for warmth.When class starts, Mrs. Puff asks Patrick his name. Nervous, he replies with \"twenty-four\", which he and SpongeBob find incredibly funny and proceed to joke about during class. Mrs. Puff hears their jokes and catches them, letting Patrick off the hook with a warning since he is new, but gives SpongeBob a stronger warning, stating that she expects more from him. Patrick then draws an insulting depiction of Mrs. Puff and places it on SpongeBob's desk. Mrs. Puff, thinking the picture is SpongeBob's doing, removes one of his stars from the Good Noodle Board as punishment for two classroom disruptions, much to SpongeBob's horror. Mrs. Puff then tells SpongeBob to move to the back of the room, where Patrick continues to annoy him. When SpongeBob snaps upon being annoyed that Patrick pestered him only to say a less-than-significant \"hi\", an angry Mrs. Puff appears, sarcastically stating that SpongeBob can have his recess.At recess, SpongeBob blames Patrick for getting him in trouble, getting him sent to the back of the classroom, and for having his Good Noodle star removed. Patrick defensively states, \"Who cares about a stupid star?\". This results in the duo fighting in the hallway, until they are both sent to detention. During detention, the lightbulb keeping Roger alive burns out. At first, they refuse to even look at each other due to their previous disagreement, but frightened for Roger's life, SpongeBob and Patrick apologize and work together to save him. SpongeBob keeps Roger warm, while Patrick gets a new lightbulb.Just as they save the egg, Mrs. Puff appears, having seen the whole incident through her one-way chalkboard. She decides to give them one star each for having saved Roger. Patrick then states that he has mistaken boating school for Spanish class. After Patrick leaves, Roger hatches from the egg, presented as a live-action chick, and asks what he missed.","musics":["Stepping into Danger","French Horn Sting","Staatstrauer","Dramatic Climax","Stiff Upper Lip","Hilo Rag","Lonely Heart's Club","Killer Birds","Steel Licks 47","The Oracle","Tiroler Jodler 2","Hawaiian Cocktail","Point of Departure M","Steel Licks 41","Heroes Win [#34]","Vibe & Harp Hits","Jingle Bells","Steel Licks 40","Idea Sting","Hula Festival","Tomfoolery","Point of Departure O","So Tired","Thats It !","Horlepiep"],"transcript":"[The episode opens in the morning at SpongeBob's home. As SpongeBob is sleeping in his bedroom, the foghorn alarm sounds off.] SpongeBob: [turns off the alarm] Time for Boating School! Let 'er rip, Gary! [Gary pushes a button that sends SpongeBob jumping out of his bed, into the air. SpongeBob bounces off a chair, while sipping his cup of tea] Ah... [toast pop out into the air, where SpongeBob eats them. Gary spits SpongeBob's pants into the air where SpongeBob lands on a target that Gary has painted] Ta-dah! Not bad, partner in crime! The toast could have been a little darker, though. [Gary gives him an angry look. SpongeBob heads to the door] See you later! [opens the door where Patrick is standing there with a net in his hand] Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, want to go jellyfishing? SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have school today. Patrick: Well, what am I supposed to do all day while you're at school? SpongeBob: I don't know. What do you normally do while I'm gone? Patrick: [starts to cry] Wait for you to get back. SpongeBob: Wait a second, Patrick. Why don't you come to school with me? Patrick: Hey, that's a great idea! SpongeBob: You and me in school together as classmates! Think about it! [Patrick imagines a live-action Kindergarten Class photo of him and SpongeBob smiling goofy with each other] Patrick: Wow. [Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick entering Mrs. Puff Boating School.] SpongeBob: Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime. [shows Patrick Mrs. Puff's Boating School] Patrick: [laughs] And no line. SpongeBob: Behold, Patrick, the Hallway of Learning. [runs up to the water fountain] And this is the Fountain of Learning. [runs to the lockers] And these are the Lockers of Learning. Patrick: [runs up to some stairs] And these are the Stairs of Learning, right? SpongeBob: No, they're just the stairs. [walks over to another set of stairs] These are the Stairs of Learning. Patrick: Where is everyone? SpongeBob: I don't know. Home, probably. Class doesn't start 'till 9:00. Patrick: [suddenly shown with a watch, and looks at it] 6:20? But I thought you said you were late. SpongeBob: Late for being early. Patrick: Hey! [looks at his watch] When did I start wearing a watch? SpongeBob: [both walk into the classroom] And now, for the room with the most class: the classroom. Patrick: Oh... SpongeBob: [walks up to the chalkboard] And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain of Knowledge. Patrick: Oh. SpongeBob: [walks up to the Good Noodle Board] And those drinks are recorded here, on the Good Noodle Board. [looks at Patrick] Patrick: Huh? Uh, sorry. Oh! SpongeBob: [points to each star] Attendance. Penmanship. Basic Desk Sanitation. Advanced Desk Sanitation. I'll add your name so you can start collecting good noodle stars, too. [adds Patrick's name] There you are. Patrick: But look at all the stars you have! I'll never be that good. SpongeBob: Oh, now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. [clears throat, high pitched voice] Seventy-four... Patrick: Who said that? [runs over to an egg in a box] Was it him? SpongeBob: I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project. Patrick: What does he teach us? SpongeBob: The greatest lesson of all: the precious value of life. You see, Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat. [points the light bulb] This light bulb represents knowledge. And without its energy and warmth, within minutes, Roger would die. Patrick: [rapidly turns light on and off] Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick: [turns light back on] Sorry. [SpongeBob moves his desk to the front of the teacher's desk] SpongeBob: The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher. Think you can handle the second chair? Patrick: [jumps into the chair] I'm learning! SpongeBob: This is gonna be great! [SpongeBob and Patrick both giggle. Bubble transition to later during class.] Mrs. Puff: Hello, class, my name is Mrs. Puff. And the only reason I say that I see we have a new student. Young man, why don't you stand up and introduce yourself? Patrick: [confused] Who's the fat kid talking to? SpongeBob: You, Patrick, she's the teacher. Patrick: Oh. Mrs. Puff: Come on now, tell the class your name. Don't be nervous. [Patrick gets up and looks at the class] Patrick: Uh... uh... Mrs. Puff: We just want to know your name. [Patrick gets more nervous] Patrick: Uh... uh... uh... twenty-four! [class laughs hysterically] Mrs. Puff: [sarcastically] Oh, great, another genius... Patrick: [sits back down] Why are they laughing? SpongeBob: I guess it's just in the timing. Patrick: Oh. [Patrick laughs after a brief pause] Mrs. Puff: [writes on the chalkboard] Today's first lesson will be on turning. Patrick: [whispering] Twenty-four. [both start to giggle, and Mrs. Puff pauses and continues writing] SpongeBob: [whispering] Hey, Patrick. Patrick: [whispering] What? SpongeBob: [whispering] I thought of something funnier than twenty-four. Patrick: [whispering] Let me hear it. SpongeBob: [stifled laugh] Twenty-five! [both try and fail to hold in their laughter. Patrick goes red in the face while SpongeBob bangs his fist on his desk] Mrs. Puff: [overhears] That's enough! [they immediately stop laughing] Young man, this is your first day, so I'll let you off with a warning. As for you, SpongeBob, I expect more from a good noodle. Pay attention. SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff: Now then, \"Turning\"; what every driver should know. When you are turning, it is important to signal at least... [Patrick places a paper on SpongeBob's desk] SpongeBob: [looks at the drawing Patrick gave him of Mrs. Puff and gasps] Big Fat Meanie? Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher! Mrs. Puff: What about the teacher? [SpongeBob screams then shivers and bites his lip in fear as Mrs. Puff sees Patrick's drawing of her. She appears in the same shape as Patrick's drawing.] As if I really look like this! [puts it in a drawer with a bunch of other bad drawings of her. Then she returns back to her original shape.] SpongeBob, I believe you know the punishment for two classroom disruptions. [takes out a scraper] SpongeBob: No... Mrs. Puff: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. But if one wishes to be a good noodle, one must behave like a good noodle. [walks over to the Good Noodle Board] SpongeBob: [starting to cry] I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle! Mrs. Puff: [about to remove the star] You'll get this star back when you earn it. SpongeBob: [wailing] No...! [As Mrs. Puff positions the scraper under the star and begins to peel it off, SpongeBob goes berserk, bouncing up and down in his seat and banging his head on his desk, constantly panting as he bangs his head.] [SpongeBob's head spins around on his body as Mrs. Puff slowly removes the star.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! [When the glue holding the star to the board stretches to the point of it snapping off the board, SpongeBob's eyes roll to the back of his head and he faints, sliding out of his seat onto the floor.] Patrick: [raises his hand] Mrs. Puff, is it naptime? Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I've had enough of your nonsense. Now collect your things and move to the available desk in the back of the room! SpongeBob: But... me? But why? Mrs. Puff: Because the Big Fat Meanie said so. Now go! SpongeBob: [mad] Thanks a lot, Patrick. Patrick: Sure thing, buddy. [SpongeBob walks to the back. His classmates are staring at him] SpongeBob: Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here. [Mrs. Puff's voice is receding as SpongeBob tries to listen from the back] It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway? [reads the writing on the desk] \"SKOOL is 4 CHUMPS.\" [horrified] Where am I?! Patrick: [whispering] Psst, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: [to self] Just ignore him, SpongeBob. Patrick: [whispering] SpongeBob, over here. SpongeBob: Whatever you do, don't look at him. Patrick: Psst, SpongeBob! [grunts as he throws a piece of wadded-up paper at SpongeBob] Psst, SpongeBob! [throws a book at SpongeBob] SpongeBob? [spits a bunch of spitballs on SpongeBob's face] SpongeBob? Psst, over here. I'm trying to tell you something. Something important. SpongeBob: [whispers loudly] What?! Patrick: [meekly] Hi. SpongeBob: [screams with fury] HI?! [growls, removing all the spitballs, then stops when he sees Mrs. Puff angry, covered in the spitballs] Mrs. Puff: Perhaps this would be a good time for recess. [Bubble transition to SpongeBob at his locker. Patrick walks up to him.] Patrick: Hey, buddy. Funny stuff in there, funny stuff. SpongeBob: [furiously slams his locker] There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars! Patrick: [frowning] Who cares about a stupid star? SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, considering you are one! Patrick: I'll deal with you after class! SpongeBob: It is after class! [a group of students crowd around SpongeBob and Patrick chanting \"fight\"] Patrick: I don't see anyone fighting, do you? SpongeBob: They're talking about us! We're fighting! Patrick: Well, don't mind if I do! [both start to punch. The group of students start to quiet down as they notice SpongeBob and Patrick are punching, but no hits are landing] Student: This is embarrassing. [everyone leaves as Mrs. Puff walks up] Mrs. Puff: [lifts SpongeBob and Patrick] What's going on here?! [looks at Patrick] Well? Patrick: SpongeBob and I were fighting. Mrs. Puff: [gasps] Fighting? [puts them down] Well, I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob SquarePants, I hereby sentence you and your friend [lights dim on Mrs. Puff and scary music plays] to detention! SpongeBob: Detention?! [after school] Mrs. Puff: May Neptune have mercy on your soul. [turns off the flashlight she was holding] [Bubble transition back to the classroom where SpongeBob, sitting at the front, and Patrick, sitting at the back, are serving detention time.] SpongeBob: [sulking] In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg. [angrily] It's all Stupid Patrick's fault. [turns to look at Patrick] I hate you, Patrick. Patrick: I hate you more. SpongeBob: I'd hate you no matter what. Patrick: Yeah, well, I'd hate you even if I didn't hate you. SpongeBob: [stares at Patrick for a few seconds, then narrows his eyes] I'd hate you even if that made sense. Patrick: I'd hate you even if you were me. That's how much I hate you. SpongeBob: I'd hate you, even if, uhh... [tries to think of something else to say] Um, I'd hate you... [points to Roger's tank] even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out. [The camera quickly pans over to where SpongeBob is pointing. Suddenly, the light bulb flickers, and then burns out and the electricity crackles] Huh? [SpongeBob bites his lip and starts shivering. He glances over at Patrick. Patrick is sitting at his desk about to cry.] Patrick: Ohh... [He starts to turn to look at SpongeBob, but when he sees him, he quickly looks away from him, crossing his arms.] Hmph. [SpongeBob watches Patrick, surprised, then does the same. But then he sees Roger's egg shivering in his tank and really starts to panic. We then see that it's snowing in Roger's tank. Snow is piled up around Roger, who is shivering under a pile of snow. Sleigh bells jingle in the background.] Patrick: [teary-eyed again] Oh...! [cut back to Roger, who is frozen inside a giant ice cube, with wind blowing] [SpongeBob and Patrick begin to quietly sob. The camera closes-up on SpongeBob, then Patrick. Finally, unable to take it anymore, SpongeBob turns around in his desk.] SpongeBob: [turns to Patrick, crying] I'm sorry I called you a stupid star! Patrick: [also crying, talking fast] I'm sorry I got you in trouble and got you moved to the back of the class and got your Good Noodle Star removed and shot the spitballs! SpongeBob: I'm sorry your apology is so long! Patrick: Me too, let's save Roger! [they run to Roger] SpongeBob: [takes Roger] I'll keep him warm, and you get a light bulb from the supply closet. Patrick: [opens the door to the supply closet] Ah. Lightbulb! [there is a pile of light bulbs, but Patrick is looking at the one that is already plugged in at the top] But why does it have to be so far away? [begins to climb the pile of bulbs. SpongeBob tries warming up the egg by sitting on it, huffing and puffing on it, etc. while Patrick is still climbing the pile of light bulbs, wearing fancy clothing. Patrick finally reaches the top, blows a horn, removes his clothes, then runs down the pile with the light bulb] I'm coming, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Oh, where's Patrick? Aw, forget it. I've got to go find Roger some warmth. [runs into Patrick and both of their items are in the air] The light bulb! Without its warmth, Roger will die! Patrick: Roger! Without him, the light bulb will have nothing to warm! [both jump for the item that is closest to them and crash into the floor with an item in their hands. They put the light bulb and egg back where they were] SpongeBob: We did it, Patrick! We saved Roger's life! Mrs. Puff: [off-screen] Good job, boys! [turns on a light from behind the chalkboard] I saw the whole thing from behind my one-way chalkboard, and I couldn't be happier with your teamwork. I've decided to give you each one gold star. Although, I'm not sure what saving an egg has to do with Boating School. Patrick: Boating School? I thought this was Spanish class. See ya, SpongeBob. See ya, Big Fat Meanie. [leaves the classroom] Roger: [egg hatches] Hey, what'd I miss?

Suddenly, his alarm clock goes off, waking him up. He prepares for another day at the Krusty Krab. While SpongeBob gets ready to go to work, he sees Squidward and asks him why he is playing his clarinet. Squidward says he is practicing for his performance tomorrow. Squidward keeps walking to work while SpongeBob visits Sandy. He finds Sandy with a machine that can transport things. Sandy shows SpongeBob how it works by teleporting an apple to Mrs. Puff's desk. SpongeBob asks Sandy if it can transport him to the Krusty Krab. She allows him to try it. When he gets there, part of Squidward's arm gets stuck in him. Suddenly, the machine's remote control goes haywire and burns out and SpongeBob and Squidward are transported back, fusing them.Sandy sees what has happened and is terrified. When they walk out, SpongeBob has his normal head\/body, while Squidward's head is sticking out of the upper left. They are also in control of each other's arms; SpongeBob is controlling Squidward's hand, while Squidward is controlling SpongeBob's. Squidward tries to get out, but he cannot. He is scared of the fact he and SpongeBob are stuck together. SpongeBob says they can be together forever now, scaring him more. Squidward asks Sandy to do something. She decides to zap them back in the transporter. She zaps them to a school, a hospital, and an unnamed planet, but they are still stuck together. Squidward says she has to get them unstuck. Sandy tells Squidward she was working on a new invention, but it is not ready. He tells her to hurry because he cannot stay stuck to SpongeBob.She tells him to stay calm, and she will continue working on it. Squidward and SpongeBob are riding to work on a bike. SpongeBob says he will drive, but Squidward keeps getting hit by the wheel. They crash into the kitchen, and Mr. Krabs asks what happened. They stand up, revealing their morphed body. Mr. Krabs just tells them to get to work. They try working, but they cannot because they are stuck together. Mr. Krabs kicks them out and tells them not to come back until they fix their problem. SpongeBob says they still have each other, and Squidward angrily says that is how they ended up like this in the first place. Squidward practices playing clarinet while SpongeBob is sad. A surfer guy passes and says \"Rock on, Freaky Bro.\" They run over to Sandy's and ask her if she has found a way to fix them. Sandy says she has invented the Molecular Separator Ray. Squidward is ready to be free, but Sandy says the invention is not complete . She says she will probably have it ready the day after tomorrow. Squidward frantically puts his face on her helmet and tells her he has a performance tomorrow. So she tells him she will have it ready before he goes on.

Audience Member #2: I love you, Squidward. You're my favorite! [Dream Squidward laughs as he does a crowd surf. The alarm goes off, and Squidward wakes up from his dream.] Squidward: Alright, alright. Time for another hideous day at work. Ahh, just hang in there, gorgeous. [Plays a few notes on his clarinet] Your star will shine at the clarinet recital tomorrow. [laughs] SpongeBob: Time for another glorious day at work. [winks at his tie, the tie winks back] Good morning, Squidward! [walks down the street with Squidward] And isn't it a lovely morning? Why are you playing the clarinet on your way to work? Squidward: I'm practicing for my clarinet recital. Soon, all of Bikini Bottom will recognize the talent that is Squidward Tentacles. Goodbye, SpongeBoob. SpongeBob: See ya at the Krusty Krab, Squidwart. Hey, Sandy, what's this? Sandy: Well, this here is my new matter transporter. It can move things from one place to another in the blink of an eye. SpongeBob: Ooh, that sounds fancy. Sandy: Let me show you how it works. [puts an apple in the transporter] SpongeBob: Whoa! [apple disappears] Where'd it go? Sandy: Just where you think it would be. [apple appears on Mrs. Puff's desk] Mrs. Puff: Oh! SpongeBob: Uh-oh, I'm late for work. Do you think your machine can zap me over to the Krusty Krab? Sandy: I always did want to try a critter. Sure, why not? Get in there, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo! [goes into transporter] Sandy: Hold on tight. SpongeBob: [transporter starts] Gee, Sandy, this sure feels... Squidward: [walking up to the Krusty Krab] Well, here we go again. [as he reaches for the door, SpongeBob appears and Squidward's arm is attached through SpongeBob's body] SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward!

SpongeBob and Squidward are mutated into one body] SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy! Squidward: I'm not sure what it is, but something seems different about me. SpongeBob: Yeah, me too. Squidward: Hey! What are you doing with my hand? Wha-what am I doing with your hand? Daaaghh! What is this?! We're all... mixed-up together! [tries to detach himself, but fails] This is horrible! I have my clarinet recital tomorrow! SpongeBob: Oh, it's not so bad, Squidward. Now we can be best buddies and do everything together, forever. Squidward: [screams] Sandy, was this your doing? You've got to get us separated! Sandy: Well, I wish I knew how. Squidward: Well, you have to do something! I can't stay stuck to him ! Sandy: Hmmm, I wonder what would happen if I tried zapping you back in the transporter. Squidward: Uhh, yeah, yeah, yeah, good idea. Let's try it. Sandy: Well, here goes nothing. [transports to Bikini Bottom Elementary] Incidental 115: All right, children. Today's Timmy's birthday. You know what that means. Ready, Timmy? [opens present. SpongeBob and Squidward rise up from the box, still mutated together. Mable screams as SpongeBob and Squidward get transported again] Doctor: Congratulations, Mrs. Smith.

The lady monster slaps the one-eyed monster's face and leaves] Squidward: It's no use, Sandy. We're still the same. Sandy: Well, that's a darn shame. You know what, I was working on the blueprints for a new invention. But it's still in the embryonic stage. Squidward: Try anything! I cannot go to my clarinet recital like this. Sandy: I'll continue working on it. In the meantime, you boys keep your head up. SpongeBob: Together forever. Squidward: Misery. [later, SpongeBob and Squidward are riding a bike to work] SpongeBob, hasn't anyone taught you how to ride a bike? SpongeBob: Don't worry, I'll drive. Squidward: [Squidward's head bumps against the wheel of the bike] Ow, ow, ow. SpongeBob! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. [both enter the Krusty Krab riding the bike. The bike crashes into the boat and they fly through the kitchen window] Incidental 114: I gotta lay off the hot sauce. Mr. Krabs: [enters kitchen] What in blazes is going on in here? SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs: What are you two doing laying around? Get to work. Squidward: If you say so. [as they stand up, Mr. Krabs freaks out] Mr. Krabs: Egad! What happened to ya? Uhh, I don't want to know. Just go do your jobs. SpongeBob: Aye aye, cap'n! Squidward: Do you have to be such an accommodating buffoon? SpongeBob: Squidward, everybody knows I'm a sponge. I look nothing like a balloon. Squidward: I don't have time for this. I've got to man the cash register. [stretches his head through the kitchen window] Whew. Can I help you? Customer #2: Can I get two Krabby Patties, please? Squidward: SpongeBob, I need two Krabby Patties. SpongeBob: Two Krabby Patties coming right up. [notices the buns are out of reach] I can't... reach the buns. Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's the holdup?! SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on it. Mr. Krabs: Time is money, boy. SpongeBob: Time is money. Right. [reaches bun] Hello, bun. At last we meet. [Squidward can't hold the cash register. His head flies through the kitchen window, onto the grill and crashes into SpongeBob] And now for the- Mr. Krabs: Alright, that's it. I can't afford you jeopardizing me business. You two are more trouble than you're worth. [pushes them out the restaurant] And don't come back until you get this problem sorted out. SpongeBob: Look on the bright side, Squidward. At least we still have each other. Squidward: That's how we got into this predicament in the first place, you imbecile! Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like a moment of peace. [plays clarinet as they walk past a surfer] Surfer: Whoa, rock on, freaky bro! Squidward: Sandy! Sandy! Please tell me you've figured out a way to separate us. Sandy: Say hello to the 'Molecular Separator Ray'. Squidward: Hello, Molecular Separator Ray. Well, let's get on with it. My clarinet recital is tomorrow night. Sandy: Uhh, well, I'm not quite done with it yet. Squidward: What'd you say? Sandy: I'm still putting it together. At best I'll have it ready, uhh, the day after tomorrow? Maybe?

[SpongeBob smiles] Sandy, please, you've got to do it before the show! Sandy: Well, uhh, I suppose... I'll have it ready before you go on. [Squidward and SpongeBob stretch through their front doors, but can't walk much further, so their houses collide together] Squidward: Of course. [at the clarinet recital] Oh, my. [not an empty seat in the house] Where are you, Sandy? Sandy? I can't do it. I can't go out there. SpongeBob: Squidward, this is your moment. The story you will tell when you look back as a... superstar! Squidward: Superstar? SpongeBob: Now go out there and give them the best darn show they've ever seen! Squidward: You're right! The show must go on! Announcer: Ladies and gentlefish, Bikini Bottom's Community Rec Center is proud to present: Squidward Tentacles. [curtain rises to Squidward wearing a big cape like clothing. Squidward starts playing and everyone begins to hate it] Incidental 14: Honey, I'm scared. [the crowd continues to hate Squidward playing the clarinet, the cape comes off as a nail tears it. SpongeBob starts to see the crowd, the crowd gasps] SpongeBob: Uhh, hi. Incidental 37B: Whoa. Rock on, freaky bro! Yeah. Whoo! [crowd cheers] SpongeBob: Wow, they really liked it. Mr. Krabs: [laughing] There you go, Squiddy! Squidward: They... they... they're cheering. Superstardom. This must be what it feels like. This is what it looks like. What it [starts to laugh happily] sounds like. And... [smells the air] ...what it smells like. Oh, simply intoxicating. Sandy: Whoo-wee, there you boys are. Looks like I'm just in time. SpongeBob and Squidward: Sandy? Sandy: One blast of this Molecular Separator Ray and you'll be separated for good. [SpongeBob and Squidward try to tell Sandy not to blast them, but was too late, she blasts the ray at Squidward and SpongeBob and it separates them. Crowd gasps] Squidward: [SpongeBob gives him back his clarinet] Hmph. [plays clarinet off-key making SpongeBob cheer for him, but the audience hates it as they block their ears, Old Man Jenkins faints off his chair] Incidental 87: I think I'm going to be sick! [Squidward blows his clarinet at Incidental 107, which blows his skin off and shows his skeleton] Incidental 107: Ah, I'm out of here! Squidward: Huh, no, wait. Wait! [everyone leaves] Oh, my one moment of fame... gone. [grabs the Molecular Separator Ray] There's got to be some way to reverse this. [pushes the button over and over] Sandy: No, Squidward! That's a very sensitive device! SpongeBob: Squidward, I wouldn't--! [laser blasts into the final scene] Therapist: So, what seems to be the problem, Mr. Tentacles?

However, SpongeBob is the only student who has ever failed her boating class, but has done so 1,258,056 times. Mrs. Puff is told to show Mr. Fitz everything she has taught SpongeBob, and within seconds, he fails yet another driving test by bashing into a boatmobile. Mr. Fitz fires Mrs. Puff, much to her delight of not having to deal with SpongeBob anymore. A new boating instructor named Sergeant Roderick comes in and takes over the school.Sergeant Roderick is a viciously hard-drill instructor, who immediately smashes Mrs. Puff's id card on the desk and throws out one student for talking and another one for eating. All of the other students run away, except for SpongeBob, who is now his only student. The new boating instructor has set up a difficult course, which he trains SpongeBob to crawl, walk, run, and eventually drive through while blindfolded. Despite SpongeBob's unprofessional driving skills, he surprisingly masters this.During the time of his final exam, which Mr. Fitz personally comes to watch, SpongeBob attempts to wear his blindfold for it, but Roderick finally tells him that's illegal, despite SpongeBob reminding he can't drive without a blindfold on. Roderick orders him to drive, and SpongeBob does what he's told and starts driving with the same disastrous results, destroying part of Bikini Bottom in the process. While driving thru a field, the boat picks up Mrs. Puff while she is painting. Roderick tells SpongeBob to use the brakes, but he misunderstands what he means and removes them. Roderick then jumps out of the boat and tries to stop it by jumping in front of it but is easily run over by it. After SpongeBob loses his sight due to getting Patrick's pants over his eyes, he begins to drive easily again and successfully avoids crashing into several cars and two pedestrians, then reverse parallel parks the boat. However, due to the damage he did to the city, he fails his test once again. Mr. Fitz realizes that SpongeBob is \"unteachable\" even with their best teacher and rehires Mrs. Puff.The next day, SpongeBob goes to Mrs. Puff's class and gives back her repaired id card as a \"welcome back\" gift, then proceeding to apologize for his destruction. Though Mrs. Puff tearfully tells him that she got her teaching degree back, and SpongeBob's file was destroyed in the fire, so it was as if he never failed her boating school. SpongeBob leaves, promising it will not take him a \"million times\" to pass school, leaving a devastated Mrs. Puff to cry and finishing the episode from there.","musics":["Steel Licks 46","Spongemonger","Lap Steel","Dangerous C","Drum March Transition","Transformer Malfuction","King Kong Coming","Dramatic Cue (E)","Steel Licks 78","Dramatic Cue (A)","Proud Fanfare","Bonnie Blue Gal","Giving Orders","Hawaiian Cocktail","Astronauts March","Dramatic Impact (1)","The Achterhoek Dances","Pell-Mell","Furtive Footsteps","Steel Licks 22","Grass Skirt Chase","Earls Revenge","Finger of Fear","Vibe Q Sting","Big Ed's March","Arnold Is Back 1","Drummers and Fifers","Moloka'i Nui A","Deadline","Up She Rises","Search Party 3 [#52]","Tympup A","Sleepy Time","Tymp Accent","Dramatic Impact (2)","Satin Slipper","Running Bass","Horlepiep"],"transcript":"[The episode starts at Mrs. Puff's Boating School] Mr. Gunther Fitz: Morning, Mrs. Puff. I'm Mr. Fitz. I represent the 'Boating Teachers Accreditation Bureau'. As you know, your teaching certificate is up for renewal. However, we have noticed there have been an unusually large amount of failings from this classroom. Mrs. Puff: That's impossible. In all my years of teaching, only one student has failed my class. Mr. Fitz: Yes, but he's failed 1,258,056 times. [Shows folder with a bunch of files. While flipping through them, SpongeBob's picture is him laughing frame by frame while his laughter is heard] Mrs. Puff: You don't understand. SpongeBob is unteachable. Mr. Fitz: We cannot blame the students for the incompetence of the teacher. SpongeBob: Honk honk! Beep beep! I'm ready to drive. Are you ready for my driving test today, Mrs. Puff? Mr. Fitz: Okay, Mrs. Puff, if SpongeBob fails this test, you will be replaced. [Bubble transition to Mrs. Puff, SpongeBob, and Mr. Fitz in the boat.] Mrs. Puff: Okay, SpongeBob, let's demonstrate for Mr. Fitz everything I've taught you in boating school. Now, what's the first thing we do before we start boating? SpongeBob: [snaps fingers] Seat-belt-aroony. One second. [gets tangled in seat-belt then squeezes self through. Mr. Fitz writes on his notepad] Mrs. Puff: Then what do you do? SpongeBob: Start the engine? Mrs. Puff: Yes. SpongeBob: [starts the boat] What do I do now? Mrs. Puff: Drive the boat.

I thought this day would never come. Goodbye, SpongeBob! Have a nice life. [flies away] Free at last! Free at last! SpongeBob: [in classroom] I got Mrs. Puff fired. [banging and crashing] Sergeant Sam Roderick: Hello, worthless students. I'm your new instructor. [he smashes Mrs. Puff's nameplate] No one's ever failed my class... that's lived through it. I can assure you these next 4 weeks will be the worst years of your miserable lives. Your spine will break, your teeth will ache, your eyes will be bloodshot. You will drive out of this school in style. Or you will be carted out in your granny's hand basket. Everyone will follow the rules of the class. First rule: No talking. Nat: Does that mean... [Roderick throws him through the door] Roderick: Second Rule: no eating in my class. Would anyone care for a bon-bon? [All the students, including SpongeBob, keep silent] Monroe: Uhh, I'll eat one! [all gasp. Monroe walks to Roderick] Roderick: Pick your favorite. [Monroe takes one and eats it] How's it taste? Monroe: It's a delightful taste sensation. Roderick: No eating in my classroom! [throws Monroe through another door] Now, if anyone else is man enough to stay in this class... [everyone but SpongeBob run out] Looks like you're the man, Sponge. SpongeBob: I am? Roderick: [outside] Do you wanna learn how to drive or what? SpongeBob: Yes, sir! I'm ready to drive. [jumps in the boat] Roderick: What do you think you're doing? SpongeBob: Ready for my test, sir. Roderick: [takes SpongeBob out of the boat] You're not ready to drive yet until you learn that first. [shows roads will all sorts of obstacles] This is [the] most grueling driving course ever devised. You will learn every turn, bump, and crack on it. You'll start out crawling it. SpongeBob: Crawl? [Bubble transition to SpongeBob crawling at the starting line.] Roderick: Hut, two, hut, two, hut, two, hut, two. [SpongeBob crawls forward] SpongeBob: Left turn. [turns left] Crack. Bump. Nickel. Hey a nickel! Roderick: Keep your eyes on the road, cadet. SpongeBob: Pebble! [crawls faster and more out of control. Gets the pebble stuck in his hand and goes on screaming in pain] Owww! Woooah! Aaah! Woah! [his butt gets set on fire rolls down the obstacle course then flies into the air, out of the water where Bikini Atoll is sitting, then falls back down where the instructor catches him as he screams] Aaah! Woah! Aaaahhh! [he stops screaming] Whew! [falls with only his arm taken off] Roderick: I'm ashamed of you, cadet. [removes the pebble from SpongeBob's hand] Tripped up by a wee pebble. [crushes the pebble] What are you suppose to be learning in my class? SpongeBob: How to drive, sir? Roderick: Affirmative. But before you learn to drive, you must learn to crawl . And then you learn to walk and then you learn to run. But before you learn to walk, you must learn to crawl . [bends SpongeBob's arm] I want you to crawl ! [puts SpongeBob's arm back] SpongeBob: Sir, yes, sir! Roderick: Now get out there! [SpongeBob crawls around a hole then his instructor takes off his shoes and socks except the ripped top parts of his socks; he wiggles his toes after his shoes are forcibly taken off, and carries the instructor on his back barefooted. Then he stops at a stop sign, and runs in and out of some radioactive waste] Every good boater needs to know his vehicle inside and out. [hands SpongeBob a wrench] Here, go take that boat apart. [SpongeBob takes the boat apart] I'm impressed, son. Put it back together again! SpongeBob: [laughs] That'll be easy. Roderick: Are you sure? SpongeBob: Um, yeah. You just put the jigamahoo on the doohickey and uhh... [laughs] I might need a couple minutes. [later, the instructor is sleeping] It's ready, sarge! [SpongeBob has re-assembled the boat into a rocket ship] Roderick: [wakes up] Jumpin' jellyfish... [the rocket blasts off] SpongeBob: Watch for pedestrians. Check mirrors. Observe that speed limit. Watch for pedestrians! [crashes through a lot of pedestrians as he screams and he gets out of control] So, umm, how'd I do? Roderick: How'd you do? Why don't you ask the shattered remains of this pedestrian... [yelling] how you did!? SpongeBob: Now I know this forwards, backwards, and sideways. Am I ready to get behind the wheel? Roderick: Not quite. [puts blindfold on SpongeBob] Now do it blindfolded. [SpongeBob crashes through another pedestrian off-screen.] French Narrator: Several days later... SpongeBob: 1003, 1004, 1005. [stops] Ooh, pebble #143. [steps over pebble] Ha, you will not trip me up again, pebble #143! 1006, 1007, 1008. [old lady pedestrian pops up with a ham sandwich] Old lady with a ham sandwich. 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012. Roderick: Congratulations. You're ready to get behind the wheel. SpongeBob: Really? I'm ready! I'm ready. I'm... [runs into a pole] Roderick: [now in boat] Let's see what I taught you, laddy. SpongeBob: Yes, sir! [drives boat] Left turn at pebble #143. Kid with a ball. [SpongeBob continues] Nice boy. Roderick: Nice driving. Now parallel park up ahead. [SpongeBob parallel parks] Very good. [now at real exam] Now, boy, the time has come to show Mr. Fits what you've learn. SpongeBob: Yes, sir! Step 1: seatbelts. [puts on seatbelt with no problem] Roderick: Excellent work, cadet. What's next? SpongeBob: Step 2 would be... ignite engine. Roderick: Step 3? SpongeBob: Step 3 would be... [takes out blindfold and his eyes shrink] ...engage blindfold. Roderick: What? You can't drive a boat with a blindfold on. That's illegal. SpongeBob: But I can't do it without a blindfold. Roderick: Drive, boy! Drive! [SpongeBob kicks down on the gas pedal and the boat is off. At the first turn is a giant red canister labeled \"GAS.\" SpongeBob fails to make the right turn and instead crashes right into the gas can, obliterating the boating school faculty in a mushroom-radius explosion, and sending debris from the boating school sign, etc., flying everywhere. As the debris begins to clear, the boat flies into the air and goes soaring.] Roderick: Mayday! Mayday! You're off course. [boat drives into 2 buildings then underground. Spurts out from a fire hydrant. Then crashes through a bakery and into a field where Mrs. Puff is painting the scenery] Mrs. Puff: Ah, I feel so serene now that I'm away from that homicidal maniac, SpongeBob. [Mrs. Puff notices the boat and attempts to paint something really quick. When boat runs into her, the painting shows SpongeBob, the instructor, and Mr. Fitz fearing their lives] Roderick: The brake son! SpongeBob: Aye aye, sir. [takes brake apart] There you go, sir. All I had to do was unscrew two of the bolts. Roderick: I'm gonna stop this thing. Tell my wife I love her. [jumps in front of the boat in an attempt to stop it] Come get some! [boat runs over him] SpongeBob: Man down. Man down. [SpongeBob drives into the city and into each building] Sorry, excuse me. Sorry. Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I can't stop the boat right now. [boat drives out of the now destroyed city, and then cuts to SpongeBob driving while wearing Patrick's pants over his eyes] I can't see! I can't see! Patrick: My pants! SpongeBob: Hey, I can't see! [dodges traffic and pedestrians as Mrs. Puff screams. Parallel parks] Did I pass? Mr. Fitz: Well, if there was a 'destroy the city' part of the test, you would have. Patrick: [takes his pants off SpongeBob's head and puts it back on] The nerve of some people. Mr. Fitz: Sorry, SpongeBob, you failed again. Even our finest instructor could not teach you. Mrs. Puff, you're hired again. SpongeBob: [at boating school] Hey, Mrs. Puff! Sorry I'm \"unteachable.\" Mrs. Puff: It's okay. Mr. Fitz gave me my teaching certificate back. [sniffles, holds up a burnt, charred object] And your dossier was destroyed in the explosion, [voice breaking] so it's as if you never failed. SpongeBob: I got you a welcome back gift, Mrs. Puff. [shows name tag] I found all the pieces and glued them back together. I promise it won't take me a million tries this time.

Once they arrive at the entrance, Patrick says he brought SpongeBob's special learning cards that has everything he needs to pass the boating school test. However, Patrick then eats the cards and claims learning tastes good. Even though SpongeBob needed those learning cards, Patrick convinces SpongeBob that he is a winner and does not need them. SpongeBob then claims he is a winner and takes his boating school driving test.Unfortunately, after one minute and thirty-seven seconds, SpongeBob fails the driving test for the 58th time. Patrick, thinking the test is rigged, decides to take the test himself and passes with a perfect score on the first try, much to SpongeBob's surprise and jealousy. They go to receive Patrick's license, but while his picture is being taken, an announcer comes out to reveal that since he is the one millionth person to pass the test, he has won a brand new hot red boatmobile, the new Bass Blaster 3000.SpongeBob and Patrick drive home in Patrick's new boatmobile while Patrick talks about how fun driving is, much to SpongeBob's disappointment. That night, Patrick is heard working on his boatmobile and comes to SpongeBob's door at 4 AM to show his new license. SpongeBob tries to get some sleep, but is woken up the next minute by his alarm clock.SpongeBob, now very tired, tries to walk to work, but, unable to walk because of his tiredness, he eventually gets a ride from Patrick, who rubs his license in SpongeBob's face and brags even more. When SpongeBob gets to work, he tries to talk himself out of riding with Patrick, but finds out that Mr. Krabs has chosen him to run the Krusty Krab's new drive-thru. He meets Patrick and his boat again.At closing time, Patrick drives up, now wearing a racing outfit, claiming that he must keep up his image as an \"expert driver.\" While driving around, Patrick rubs his license in SpongeBob's face even more, even stopping to talk to SpongeBob's parents about it and embarrass SpongeBob. Patrick then starts driving slightly above the speed limit, which prompts SpongeBob to try and get him in trouble for speeding, but he fails since he tells Patrick to stop and a police officer tells him he's going far under the limit. Patrick then runs three red lights, and makes an offscreen illegal U-turn through an orphanage.Furious, SpongeBob finally snaps after Patrick calls himself a \"driving genius,\" admitting his jealousy toward him and this would have been his boat if he passed. Patrick calls out SpongeBob for his jealousy and that he should be happy for him getting his license, but SpongeBob chews his friend back for rubbing his license in his face. Patrick denies this accusation and literally shoves his license between SpongeBob's eyes. In a final fit of fury, an enraged SpongeBob tears up the license and throws it out the window, much to Patrick's despair. This gets the attention of the police officer from earlier and causes a whole squad of cop cars to chase after SpongeBob and Patrick. When the police yell for Patrick to pull over, he instead begins driving out of control, not knowing what to do since he no longer has his license, and eventually drives off of a cliff into the Bikini Bottom Jail yard with the police following after him.Patrick is put on trial and found guilty of littering. The judge gives him 90 days in jail to hold him accountable. However, a remorseful SpongeBob admits the truth and gets the 90 day jail sentence in Patrick's place. When SpongeBob is happily released, he gives a delighted Patrick a new license plate for his boatmobile, but Patrick reveals that he threw out the boatmobile because it stopped working when it got to \"e\" which he thought meant \"end,\" which really meant \"empty\" as in out of gas. As the episode concludes, SpongeBob and Patrick pretend to play boats with SpongeBob putting the license on Patrick's butt and riding him away.","musics":["Star Prizes (a)","Gator","Andy Anorak","Steel Licks 47","Steel Licks 78","Hawaiian Link (B)","Solo Steel 2","Wahini Wobble No Lead","Marching to Honolulu","Hello Blues","Romantic Ending [#31]","People's Court","Astronauts March","The Orkney Rope Waltz","The Achterhoek Dances","Trafficscape","Wahini Wobble Faster","Grass Skirt Chase","Screw on the Loose","Police Car","Steel Licks 18","Tymp Accent","Wooden Bear","Great Moments","Tomfoolery","O Makalapua (b)","Horlepiep"],"transcript":"French Narrator: It is a very special day in Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob: I'm ready! [walking up to Mrs. Puff's Boating School with Patrick] I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards? Patrick: Right here, buddy. [takes them out of his pocket] Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards. [eats the cards] Mmm. SpongeBob: No, Patrick! Patrick: Hey, learning tastes good. SpongeBob: Patrick, I needed those. Patrick: Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone. SpongeBob: 57 times. Patrick: Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner. SpongeBob: I'm a winner? Patrick: Who's a winner? SpongeBob: [sadly] I'm a winner. Patrick: Who's a winner? SpongeBob: [cheered up a little] I'm a winner. Patrick: Who's a winner?! SpongeBob: I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner!

SpongeBob: I didn't get a license, Patrick. Patrick: Are they gonna mail it to you? SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all. Patrick: No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged. SpongeBob: Let's just go home, Patrick. Patrick: We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself. SpongeBob: [hanging onto Patrick's pants] No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive. [Patrick's pants rip off] Patrick: Please, SpongeBob. I think I know what I'm doing. SpongeBob: No, Patrick. No! Mrs. Puff: [Patrick walks up to the boat she is sitting in and gets in it, in his underwear] Good morning. Patrick: You're not the judge of me! Mrs. Puff: Actually, I am. Let the testing begin! [clicks her pen. Scene cuts to SpongeBob, outside the boating school] SpongeBob: I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I? Patrick: SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob: I'm here for you, buddy. Patrick: I passed my test! SpongeBob: You got a perfect score? Patrick: Yeah, I thought you said it was hard. SpongeBob: Perfect score. [eye twitches] Patrick: Come on, I'm gonna get my picture taken for my new license. [scene cuts to the license registration building] Miss Shell: Stand behind the line, sir. Patrick: [smiling] How do I look? SpongeBob: [sarcastically] Like a winner. Miss Shell: Ready? Patrick: Ready. [banner comes down which says \"CONGRATULATIONS\" on it. Balloons and confetti fall] SpongeBob: Huh? Fish: Congratulations, Mr. Star. You're the one millionth person to pass the test. Patrick: Does that mean I get a free key chain? Fish: Uhh, no. Patrick: Oh. Fish: You get a brand-new boat mobile. The new Bass Blaster 3000. The ultimate boating machine. [Patrick runs up to the new boatmobile as SpongeBob's jaw drops] Patrick: Yeah! All right! Fish: Women will want you. [all sigh] Men will want to be you. [all faint] You'll be the envy of your friends. [SpongeBob growling in fury] Patrick: Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat. SpongeBob: I'm so happy for you... [\"La Cucaracha\" horn blows in his face] Whoa! Patrick: The horn works. [scene cuts to Patrick driving his new boat down the road] Woo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license. Patrick: Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license. SpongeBob: Two millionth? Patrick: Then you can get a free boat just like me. SpongeBob: Yeah, just like you. Patrick: I try to serve as an inspiration to others. SpongeBob: Can we go home now? [zoom out and scene shows Patrick driving around his rock over and over] We've been driving around your house for hours. Patrick: I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it? SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride, Patrick. Patrick: No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian. [shudders then drives off. SpongeBob imitates Patrick. Scene cuts to SpongeBob in bed asleep. His clock turns to 3:00am when an engine revving is heard which sends SpongeBob into his diving board then back into his bed] SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing? Patrick: I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep. [SpongeBob groans and slams his window shut, breaking it, before going back to bed. Scene cuts to 4:00am] SpongeBob: 4:00? [yawns. Doorbell rings] Who could be at the door at this hou— [falls down the stairs. Opens the door] Now what is it, Patrick? Patrick: You will never guess what happen to me today. SpongeBob: You got your license. Patrick: Yeah! [shows his license] But that's not all. SpongeBob: You got a new boat. Patrick: Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life. [walks off] SpongeBob: [gets back into bed] Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep. [foghorn alarm blows] Gary: Meow. SpongeBob: Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat. [scene cuts to morning where SpongeBob is leaving home to go to work] I'm so tired. [horn honks] Patrick: Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work? SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work. [tries to take a step, but falls down in the process. Scene cuts to Patrick driving SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab] Patrick: Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license. SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride. Patrick: No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license. [SpongeBob is getting extremely enraged] SpongeBob: That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile... Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru. SpongeBob: When did we get a drive-thru? Mr. Krabs: I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams. SpongeBob: I used to have a dream. Mr. Krabs: Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living. SpongeBob: [through headphones] Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I— [\"La Cucaracha\" horn honks] Patrick: The horn still works. [scene cuts to SpongeBob switching the OPEN sign to CLOSED then walking out of work. Patrick drives up in a racing uniform] Hey, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: What's with the helmet, Patrick? Patrick: Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image. [clicks tongue] SpongeBob: Uh-huh. [scene cuts to Patrick driving] Patrick: Boy, driving is so easy. SpongeBob: Oh? Patrick: Do you want me to give you lessons? SpongeBob: [sarcastic] Oh, that would be great. Patrick: Oh! [drives over to SpongeBob's parents] SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick: Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy. Mr. SquarePants: Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you? We're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours. Patrick: What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test. Mrs. SquarePants: That's great, Patrick. Patrick: SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it. Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield. SpongeBob: Mom! Patrick: Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides. SpongeBob: Hey! [Patrick drives off] Mr. SquarePants: Even Patrick has a license. [both parents sigh] Patrick: Let's see what this baby can do. [steps on the gas. Ride pass a sign that reads 'SPEED LIMIT 40 MPH'] SpongeBob: Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph. Patrick: Yeah, yeah. SpongeBob: [reads the speedometer] 40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car. [car stops next to a policeman] Patrick: What? Where? Who? SpongeBob: Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun? Officer: Umm... okay. [uses radar gun. It reads 0mph] Actually, he's going 40mph under the limit. So, move along before I run you in, tattletale. [drives off] SpongeBob: Are you sure you don't want to run him in? [scene cuts to Patrick driving. Green light turns red] It's a red light, Patrick! [Patrick runs through three red lights] Patrick, you just ran three red lights! Patrick: So? SpongeBob: You're suppose to stop! Patrick: I think the driving genius knows what he's doing. SpongeBob: [finally snaps] Driving genius?! Would a genius make an illegal u-turn...through an orphanage?! Patrick: They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about? SpongeBob: I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile! Patrick: How can you say that? If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license! SpongeBob: If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face! Patrick: I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face! [takes out license and rubs it in SpongeBob's face--literally--which makes muffled noises] SpongeBob: [fixes his face and then furiously snatches Patrick's license out of his hand] Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this! [furiously tears up Patrick's license then laughs maniacally. The pieces of the license fly into the cop's hands.] Officer: Huh, litterbugs. This is why I joined the force. [drives off after SpongeBob & Patrick] SpongeBob & Patrick: It's the police! Officer: [over speaker] Pull it over, litterbug! Patrick: Litterbug?! No! [drives faster] Officer: Ooh, I got me a runner. [a bunch of police cars are following him] SpongeBob: Patrick, what do you think you're doing? Patrick: I don't know! I don't have a license anymore. [drives around cards, through a sign then off a cliff into the front lot of the Bikini Bottom Jail. Scene cuts to courtroom] Judge: 90 days. I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering. Patrick: So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. [a security guard takes him away, but he ducks his head back in] Sometimes you forget to feed him. [ducks out of the shot] SpongeBob: What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait! [runs up to the judge] Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead. Judge: Well, considering there's no legal precedent... oh, what the heck. 90 days! [a smiling SpongeBob is put in jail] French Narrator: One debt to society later... [After SpongeBob's 90 day sentence, shows the jail as the door buzzes. SpongeBob is let go out of jail where Patrick is waiting for him; the two silently stare at each other smiling for about ten seconds as an orchestra swells dramatically.] SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick: SpongeBob! [both hug] SpongeBob: I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever. [shows him a license plate that reads \"PALS 4 EVER\"] Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy. Patrick: Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore. SpongeBob: What? Patrick: It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E, and I figured that must mean \"end\". SpongeBob: Oh, then... what do we do with this? [Patrick takes it and puts it on his behind] Patrick: How's that? SpongeBob: Yeah! Patrick: Ready, buddy? SpongeBob: Ready, pal. [hops on Patrick's shoulders and makes car noises] Woo!

As the episode begins, Mrs. Puff first introduces herself and discusses the good and bad drivers (Squidward is the one with the Boat Smarts, and SpongeBob is the one without it).A driver with boat smarts fills their tire up to the appropriate level, but a driver without boat smarts pays no attention to how much air they are using. Squidward fills it up to the exact measurement, while SpongeBob pumps it up too much, making the boat tip over, crushing half of Squidward's boat and having the wheel pop right in front of his face.The next section is about buckling up. This shows Squidward in a boat mobile with his seatbelt in the proper manner. He then starts driving until he sees a Bikini Bottom Traffic light and he stops. Once Squidward stops, we see SpongeBob crazily speeding around a corner with no regard for safety and probably with no seatbelt on. He hits Squidward, and when he is unable to remove his seatbelt, goes flying into a spiked steamroller and gets severely hurt.In the next scene, it shows Squidward adjusting his mirrors before he begins to start the boat. Squidward starts the boat and begins to drive. SpongeBob adjusts his mirror dangerously while turning the steering wheel with one leg. He hits many fish, although he does not know because he is focusing on the mirror. He then swerves right in front of Squidward. SpongeBob adjusts the other mirror and hits Squidward with a beam of light and he is almost blinded until he puts on sunglasses. But Squidward did not see a wall and crashes into it. It shows a crash dummy, although instead of the head it shows Squidward's.Mrs. Puff is in Squidward's boat talking about not drinking or eating while driving. Squidward is driving well, as usual. Mrs. Puff explains how Squidward's eyes are locked firmly on the road. SpongeBob is then shown swerving while eating a Krabby Patty and reading a magazine. When some fish are behind him, he turns around and says: \"Hi there!\" causing them to crash. Eventually, there is a huge stockpile of cars and the owners are furious at the yellow sea sponge. SpongeBob still speeds past, runs over a puddle and slides around saying: \"Wheeeeeee!\" SpongeBob then says hi to Mrs. Puff and Squidward when SpongeBob's boat slips on a mini pebble, strangely making his boat act as a ramp in which Squidward's boat travel over. They fly into the big stockpile of all the cars and it makes a huge crash. Mrs. Puff blows up very fast and SpongeBob drives past saying: \"Looks like you guys forgot your Boat Smarts!,\" he smiles and drives off, and Mrs. Puff and Squidward are not amused, making dust and the low-quality videotape recorder stops with a frustrated Mrs. Puff saying: \"Never mind,\" as the episode abruptly ends.","musics":["Shopping Spree","Pageantry Processional","The Wheels of Industry","Highly Strung","Busy Life","Horlepiep"],"transcript":"Narrator: \"Boat Smarts with Mrs. Puff.\" This driving film is brought to you by: C.O.B.B.U.T.K.S.B.S.P.O.T.R.A.O.O.B.A.T.

I'm Mrs. Puff, state accredited boating instructor. Today, we'll be discussing the differences between a driver with boat smarts... [cut to Squidward in a pilot uniform] Squidward: Ripping good day for a spot of driving. Mrs. Puff: ...and a driver without boat smarts. [cut to SpongeBob sliding in on his head upside down, next to Squidward] SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Look at what I can do with my feet! [wiggles his legs. Squidward gets angry] Mrs. Puff: Let's see some examples, shall we? Tire Pressure. [cut to Squidward putting air in his tires] Before you can even think about boating, the boater who uses boat smarts always fills his tires to the appropriate level. [cut to SpongeBob pumping too much air in his tires] While this driver pays no need to boat smarts. [tires flips the boat over. Then the tire explodes and blows air into Squidward's face] Buckling Up. [cut to Squidward putting on safety belt] As demonstrated by this driver, he has enough boat smarts to use his seat belt and avoid a serious casualty as a result of a collision. [drives off but stops slowly at a stop light] Notice how he comes gently to a stop sign. [cut to SpongeBob driving his boat through town destructively without wearing his seat belt and laughing] Now this driver, with no regard for safety. [Squidward screams as SpongeBob slams into the backend of Squidward's boat, sending him flying into the air still in his seat and buckled up with the steering wheel in his hand. Squidward screams more as he sees a spiky steamroller driving on the road he is flying into. He tries to get his seat belt off but squeezes through the spikes anyways] Well, at least he had his seat belt on. [the boat, now cut in half, comes out of the steamroller and in it is Squidward, all injured. His seat belt pops off] Adjusting Your Mirrors. What's our boat smarts boater up to now? [Squidward is adjusting his mirrors] You guessed it. He's adjusting his mirror before he begins boating, unlike this degenerate boater. [a beeping sound is heard. SpongeBob is running over citizens while he is adjusting his mirrors] SpongeBob: Ah, perfect. [moves from behind Squidward in the road and drives in front of him] Squidward: Hey, use your mirrors, fool! SpongeBob: Mirrors? Oh, that reminds me. I haven't adjusted this one yet. [adjusts it to where the light in the reflection blinds Squidward] Squidward: Ah! Can't see! D'oh! [puts on sunglasses and giggles. Screams as he crashes into a brick wall. Footage from live-action Japanese Crash test dummy is showing with Squidward's head replacing the Japanese dummy's head. He slides out of his seat] Ow. Mrs. Puff: Finally, and most importantly, a driver with boat smarts always pays attention to his surroundings and avoids distractions. Notice how this driver's eyes are locked firmly on the road. [Squidward's eyes turn into a lock but vision the road as well. Cut to SpongeBob eating a Krabby Patty and reading the newspaper while driving] And here we have the epitome of a driver who is carelessly distracting himself from the road and safety. [SpongeBob is shaving himself while driving the wrong way on a one way street. Tom is shaking his fist, Norma looks at SpongeBob and Fred shaking his fist in the air. He causes a woman to crash into a streetlight pole] Norma: [screams] Jerk! SpongeBob: Hi there! Nat: Help! Lunatic driver! [crashes his boat into SpongeBob's but SpongeBob's boat is unharmed and keeps driving.] SpongeBob: How's it going? [causes many drivers to flip their boats over and get in accidents] Fish: [all screaming furiously and talking at once] I can't feel my hair. My leg! Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I mean, a boater without boat smarts shows contempt for his boater brethren and the law. [SpongeBob's boat slips in some water and spins around and around] SpongeBob: Lalalalalalalalala! Whee! [his boat is driving backwards now] Hi, Squidward. Hi, Mrs. Puff. [Squidward and Mrs. Puff scream. SpongeBob's boat stops on a rock and tilts upward, causing Squidward's boat to fly up into the air then into the pile of boat mobiles that are in the accident. Mrs. Puff blows up to a big puffer fish] SpongeBob: Looks like you guys forgot your boat smarts!

When class ends, Mrs. Puff reminds the class that they are going on a field trip to the Bikini Bottom Museum of Boating tomorrow and the bus will pick them up at 8:00 AM. When SpongeBob realizes that this is finally his chance to impress Mrs. Puff and get his driver's license, he reads a 7,400-page book called The History of All Boating Ever.... When SpongeBob finishes the book at 7:59 AM on the next day, he ends up falling asleep when he realizes that tomorrow is today and he is going to be late for the bus.He races the bus once it leaves his house. Mrs. Puff, wanting to go without SpongeBob, tells Nat, the bus driver, to speed up. But SpongeBob suddenly comes in through the window. While SpongeBob begins talking to Mrs. Puff, she realizes SpongeBob's bad smell and gives him a bottle of Shower in a Can. SpongeBob then starts talking about the trivia of boating, which starts to give Mrs. Puff a headache. So, when the class finally arrives at the museum, SpongeBob is paying no attention as he is still talking about boating to Mrs. Puff, crashes into the front window and gets converted into a puddle outside the bus door, he then is back up again when he sees the museum in front of him.Mrs. Puff explains it was the largest boat ever that is now converted into a museum and can no longer be operated unless it goes to its yearly check at the port. Throughout the day, SpongeBob keeps interrupting Mrs. Puff to tell the students what she is about to say, much to her chagrin. Right when the class is about to leave, Mrs. Puff notices that SpongeBob has gone missing, but it turns out that he was in the driving room of the boat. He turns on the air conditioners on very high without noticing, which accidentally starts the boat.When Mrs. Puff finds SpongeBob as she comes back into the museum, she tries to stop the boat when she noticed it has been started, but she has never driven any boat so advanced before. So when she notices that the boat is going to crash into Bikini Bottom after SpongeBob turns the boat on Turbo Speed, SpongeBob tries to stop the boat by battening down the hatches, lowering the anchor, uttering a hearty seaman's laugh, and doing the reverse 720 tailspin. And right when the boat is about to destroy Bikini Bottom, it stops, only tapping the first building. When Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob leave the boat, Mrs. Puff gives SpongeBob his driver's license due to her impression.However, she is outraged when she finds out that the museum owner was simply taking the boat into Bikini Bottom for a checkup at the port and that he was doing all of the driving. As a result she angrily tears up SpongeBob's driver's license, leaving the latter heartbroken. The museum owner then suggests that they should go get some ice cream to cheer SpongeBob up while he had the pin of becoming an Honorary Sea Legs as his bright side. When the three are about to go have ice cream, SpongeBob notices that the headlights of the boat are still on. As he runs back inside, the museum owner and Mrs. Puff try to tell SpongeBob to not touch anything, but the latter didn't listen and he flips the boat on its opposite side as Mrs. Puff inflates once again, ending the episode.","musics":["Spongemonger","Epic of the South","The Navy Lark","Birth of the Krabby Patty","Captain Pugwash","Drunken Sailor","Nude Sting","Nautical Fantasy","Steel Licks 47","Steel Licks 78","On The Beach","The Jovial Buccaneers [#33]","Hello Blues","Hawaiian Cocktail","Drama Link (D)","Sea Battle [#48]","The Achterhoek Dances","Steel Licks 35","Fierce Fight","Spanish Ladies (B)","Bucaneers 5 [#12]","The Jovial Buccaneers [#32]","Tension Bits","Hit and Run","Dramatic Sea Battle","Steel Licks 40","Whats This Sting","Nautical Discovery [#97]","Drama Link (B)","I'm Ready Fanfare","Horlepiep"],"transcript":"[Episode begins at Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Mrs. Puff is teaching her students.] Mrs. Puff: Remember, class, there's only one way to park a boat: the safe way. You now see the importance of proper steering and a properly calibrated anchor... [SpongeBob writes it down and puts the paper inside his head] ...which brings us to the subject of rudder maintenance. [bell rings. Everyone runs outside except SpongeBob] SpongeBob: Barnacles! Just as we were getting to the nitty-gritty! Mrs. Puff: Wait a minute, class! [everyone stops and bumps into each other then Jimmy Gus hits the back of the line the hardest and the first fish in line falls out the door] Remember, we will not be here tomorrow. We will be going on a field trip to the Boating Museum. Now run along, kids. [they all run out and Mrs. Puff goes to her desk] SpongeBob: Wow, the Boating Museum! Maybe tomorrow if I can impress Mrs. Puff with an extensive knowledge of boating history, she'll give me a boating license on the spot! [starts laughing and \"drives\" his chair out the door and makes boating noises] See you tomorrow, Mrs. P.! [starts laughing again] Mrs. Puff: Neptune, give me strength! [Setting goes to SpongeBob at his house at night in his library.] SpongeBob: Let's see. Ah, there she is. Whoa! [finds his boating history book and falls on the ground with the book and Gary meows] What is this, Gary? Why, it's the complete history of all boating ever and I'm going to memorize it tonight for the big field trip tomorrow. [Gary meows again] I'm perfectly capable of reading 7,400 pages and still getting my required eight hours of sleep before the bus picks me up at promptly at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get started. [Gary moves away] All right, let's see what this little pamphlet is all about. [starts reading] \"Chapter 1: In the beginning, Neptune created the sail.\" French Narrator: 7:59 a.m. SpongeBob: \"...but such tragedies will be avoided with the flying boat of the future. The end.\" [looks really exhausted from reading 7,400 pages] Time for a little shuteye before... [the camera focuses on a closeup of his bloodshot eyes with boogers, and he closes his eyes, but then his alarm rings. He opens them] Oh, Mrs. Puff, can't this wait till tomorrow? [closes his eyes again then also opens them] Hang on a minute, it is tomorrow! [runs out his door and sees the bus and runs for it] Hey, wait! Hey! Mrs. Puff! Please stop the bus! [sees Mrs. Puff through the window and knocks] Bus Driver: What was that? Mrs. Puff: Nothing, uhh, just keep driving. [SpongeBob knocks on the window again] Step on it! [The bus driver puts the pedal to metal.] SpongeBob: Wait! Mrs. Puff: Phew. [SpongeBob's face is on the window, Mrs. Puff screams and he gets inside] SpongeBob: No worries, I made it. Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, you look terrible. [SpongeBob’s face looks exhausting] SpongeBob: I assure you, I am well rested and ready to learn. Who knows, Mrs. Puff? Before the day is out you may have learned something yourself. [Mrs. Puff smells SpongeBob's odor, sprays \"Shower in a Can\" on him and he smells better] Hey, Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: Yes, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: I made this for you. Mrs. Puff: Made what? SpongeBob: [holds out a model of a tiny boat] This, the H.M.S. Pinafore, at 1 to 8,427 scale of course. Mrs. Puff: Thank you, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: Yes, SpongeBob? SpongeBob: Do you know how many rowers it takes to propel a trireme? Mrs. Puff: Well, that would be... SpongeBob: Do you know which boat is fastest on record? Mrs. Puff: Wasn't that the... SpongeBob: Did you know in the future that all boats will be powered by dolphin manure? [screen zooms in to SpongeBob] Did you know that the H.M.S. Bluetoes was originally a racing boat before it became the royal family's private yacht? Do you know what scuttling is? What's bigger, a flotilla or a fleet? Did you know... [time passes] Ever been on a... [the bus stops at the museum and SpongeBob flies to the windshield] Bus Driver: We're here. [SpongeBob goes out the door and notices the Boating Museum] Mrs. Puff: Welcome, class, to the Boating Museum. This enormous vessel was once the largest in all the seas, but now that has been converted into a museum, it no longer moves. SpongeBob: Actually, it gets taken to port once a year for maintenance. Mrs. Puff: If you don't mind, SpongeBob, I'll be doing the teaching today. SpongeBob: No problemo, Mrs. P. [Mrs. Puff and the rest enter the museum with a room with many boats] Mrs. Puff: Here it is, class. The most extensive collection of seafaring history ever assembled, from giant naval vessels to more modest craft like this clamming boat. SpongeBob: I'd say this baby can hold up to... ten clam fishers. Mrs. Puff: Uh, sure, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: Why, I bet they reel in up to 50 clams a day. Mrs. Puff: Moving along. [they go to a big boat] Over here we have the Sandy Nub. It was a cargo ship used to bring back exotic spices from faraway lands. SpongeBob: [laughs] With two direct-action steam turbines producing 6,500 horsepower geared up to triple screws, [snaps his fingers] it'll get your spices where they need to go. Mrs. Puff: [in a mad voice] Thank you again, SpongeBob. SpongeBob: It's working! She's noticing my vast of knowledge! I can now taste the sweet, sweet lamination of a fresh boating license. [Setting goes to another big boat.] Mrs. Puff: This, class, is the Lady Scallion. SpongeBob: ...named after the captain's strict diet of scallions, of which the crew complained and the captain's [makes a P.U. sign] odor strongly resembled. [the kids start taking pictures of him] For four years this brigantine explored distant lands discovering places unknown to anyone besides the people [Mrs. Puff expresses a furious face] who already lived there. [She growls. SpongeBob taps on Mrs. Puff] You ready to give me that license yet, Mrs. Puff? Mrs. Puff: [angry voice] Oh, you're going to get it all right. SpongeBob: [squeals] I knew it! [They go to more places while SpongeBob informs the class and Mrs. Puff doesn't get a chance. They go to a boat and Mrs. Puff tells them about it, but is interrupted by SpongeBob, who is looking through a telescope at the top. The kids cheer, Mrs. Puff makes an angry face. After the montage, they then walk out of the museum.] Mrs. Puff: Okay, this is the end of the tour. Anything to add, SpongeBob? [doesn't see him] SpongeBob? SpongeBob: [turns his chair around inside the museum still] Oh boy, here it is! The main controls! Just look at all this stuff! There's the triple oscillator, and there's the hoist pulley, and there's the booby trap, and there's the long range mast knob, and there's a hot dog with extra mustard. [gasps] And there is the starter mechanism. That, right there. [points at the Air Conditioner button] A\/C, hmmm...That's short for \"automatic conditionata,\" and that's fancy fancy talk for \"Let's get this party started. Like, instantly!\" [presses A\/C button, the fast air moves towards SpongeBob, who pushes the vent to the left] Tartar sauce..! Whew. [the fast air turns the boat on and an alarm occurs and gears and engines move then the boat moves] Man, I'm glad that's over. Oh, that's a nice touch, what a soothing projection screen. [glass ticks and SpongeBob looks behind] Mrs. Puff: That's not a projection screen! [runs towards SpongeBob and sits on his lap] SpongeBob, stop it right now! SpongeBob: Yes, ma’am. [turns the turbo speed on then boat goes faster] Mrs. Puff: Oh, sweet Poseidon. Move aside. [pushes SpongeBob away] I gotta stop this ship before it plows into Bikini Bottom! Uh, uh, let's see. The first thing to turn off is the... Uh, oh, dear Neptune! I've never driven anything this advanced before. [pulls SpongeBob back] SpongeBob, I hope you know what you were talking about, because it's up to you now. SpongeBob: Okay. [tries the steering wheel] Mrs. Puff: We don't have much time. In a few minutes, we'll be flattening millions of innocent lives! SpongeBob: Innocent lives?! Mrs. Puff: And you're the only one that can save them. SpongeBob: The only one...that can...save...them?! Mrs. Puff: Yes! And what I want you to do [SpongeBob's face turns into a frown] is ummm, tighten the gurneys, then survey the poop deck, and... SpongeBob: Stop! I know what to do. [pulls out a pirate hat and puts it onto his head] I read a book. Chapter 1, batten down the hatches. [all doors and windows were shut] Next, lower anchor. [the anchor lowers down, but gets stuck on railings] Oh no! [as screen shakes] The anchor is stuck. I’m going to free it manually. I'll be right back. [jumps out of the control center, flies towards the anchor and pulls the anchor with a horse gallop sound and when anchor is free, he swings back and cuts to the control center] Done and done. Thirdly, utter a hearty seaman's laugh. [laughs like a pirate but harsher] Mrs. Puff: Oh, my gravy. He even knows the hearty laugh! He has been doing his homework! SpongeBob: [still laughs] And finally, the coup de grace. The only way to park the largest ship ever built, [zooms to SpongeBob's face] is by performing the Reverse 720 Tailspin. Mrs. Puff: [gasps] But that's never been attempted before! SpongeBob: You're right, it hasn't. [says sentence with a surprise] Not until now! [the ship spins and does a backflip and spins again then returns to it's position. Cuts to a scene where Bikini Bottom is shown in the ship's windshield and stops with a tiny crash on an apartment and both SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff sighs] Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I don't know how, [her face turns into a smile] but you did it. You saved us all. Let's get off this thing. [Cut into a scene where they get off the ship] And the way you pulled the anchor out, genius! I never thought I'd say this, but here's your driver's license. [SpongeBob screams and slowly grabs the license] SpongeBob: Oh, boy! At long last! Tugboat driver: What are you doing here? [SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff look] No one should be on board while I’m tugging the museum into port. Mrs. Puff: You mean, he's not driving this thing at all? Tugboat driver: Heck, no! [Mrs. Puff rips the license, SpongeBob saddens and pulls off the hat, looking at it; to SpongeBob] Now, don't get so down, kid! Look, for your false bravery, I’m giving your honorary Sea Legs, okay? Come on, let me buy you an ice cream. [the boat alarms softly which cuts to the scene where the headlights are on] SpongeBob: Oh, gosh. [chuckles] Headlights are on! [runs back into the ship] Mrs. Puff & Tugboat driver: Don't touch anything, you twit! [SpongeBob gets back on the boat] Tugboat driver: Run! [The ship flips sideways] Mrs. Puff: [inflates then turn to SpongeBob who pops up beside her] Good thing you studied.

At first, he finds this hard to take. In a panic, he runs around town in a desperate attempt to find anyone, but to no avail.When the others do not return, SpongeBob decides to live out everyone's lives for them. He makes a bubble version of himself in his front yard, then runs to the top floor of Squidward's house, pretending to be Squidward yelling at SpongeBob for making too much noise. The latter then runs to the Krusty Krab, imitating Squidward and Mr. Krabs. He then imitates Patrick in his rock and Sandy at her treedome before running to the boating school and imitating Mrs. Puff.While in the classroom, he realizes that living out everyone's lives will not work and breaks down crying on his desk. SpongeBob's mood quickly changes when he discovers a stack of blank driver's licenses. He takes a picture of himself and prints out his own license. He then takes off with the student test boat, naming it \"Boaty,\" and joyriding throughout the city.SpongeBob and Boaty become inseparable best friends. The latter sleeps with the boat and parks it inside both his house and the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is going insane without people to talk to, and Boaty realizes this. In his closet, SpongeBob has erected a puppet of Patrick out of raw Krabby Patty meat, which he carries out a conversation with. The \"Patty-Patrick\" warns him that he cannot talk because Boaty is listening. He goes crazy from the sight of any motor vehicle, and when a bus comes, he grabs a fire axe from the cinema to chop at the bus that approaches him.To his surprise, everyone in Bikini Bottom comes out of it. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob that everyone's mysterious disappearance was really a holiday to celebrate being away from the latter for a day called National No SpongeBob Day. Before venturing off, a giant effigy of SpongeBob is erected, and then burned. Everyone then dances on the ashes to celebrate. SpongeBob is deeply saddened, not because of the holiday but that everyone was gone for so long, but Mr. Krabs tells him that the holiday is an honor, and SpongeBob feels appreciated.Patrick tells SpongeBob that the holiday is nothing compared to \"No Patrick Day.\" After Patrick says this, everyone decides to celebrate National No Patrick Day and boards the bus except for Patrick, who is stopped by SpongeBob. The second everyone leaves, Patrick sadly wonders where they went, obviously forgetting what he just said as the episode closes.","musics":["Steel Licks 46","Lap Steel","Hgliss & Bell","Apprehensive 2","Explorers 1 [#99.02]","Alone In The Old House","Hawaiian Link (B)","Steel Licks 78","Tricks and Traps","Seaweed 1","Clarinet 3","Unease","The Rake Hornpipe","Hawaiian Cocktail","Legion of Honor [#32]","12th St Rag","Crime And Danger Sign #3","Alekoki","Tiki Drums","Chinese Mystery","Cream Pie","Earls Revenge","Tiki Rapido","Dancing In Dreamland (A)","Kailua Jubilee","The Tip Top Polka\/The Cliff Polka","Tension Bits","Goofy Conversation","Whats This Sting","New Vibe Hits","The Creature (b)","Dramatic Impact (2)","SpongeBob Flashback Vibes","60's Happy Times","Horlepiep"],"transcript":"[The episode starts at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is sleeping, and his alarm clock wakes him up, he struggles to turn it off, yawns, then gets out of bed, puts his pants on, then walks into the kitchen to get food for Gary, he accidentally trips because of the heavy bag of food, and there's a big pile of food on top of Gary's bowl.] SpongeBob: Gary, come and get it! [Gary doesn't come to get the food. Outside SpongeBob's pineapple, the wind is blowing and Bikini Bottom looks completely empty] Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary!? [SpongeBob looks in the living room, at the top of the staircase, out of a door at the bottom of the staircase, under his bed, and in the toilet, SpongeBob then walks back into the kitchen] Gary must have gotten an early start. [walks away] [The scene cuts to outside where SpongeBob is walking up to Squidward's house with a megaphone.] SpongeBob: Rise and shine, Squidward! You don't wanna be late again. [silence] Okay, see you at the Krusty Krab. [now talking to himself] I guess Squidward needs his beauty sleep. Not everyone is blessed with my natural good looks. [The scene cuts to Patrick's house. SpongeBob knocks on it.] SpongeBob: Patrick, it's morning! You don't want to forget to wake up again. [silence again] Patrick? Okay, see you after work, sleepy head. [Cut to scene of SpongeBob walking on the street whistling, where nobody else is. SpongeBob hops over a boat that is in the middle of the road, then walks in the Krusty Krab, and stares out the order window. The sun is setting, and SpongeBob looks at his watch.] SpongeBob: Slow day. Good night, Squidward. Good night, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs' office door opens, revealing that Mr. Krabs is not there] [Cut back to SpongeBob's house.] SpongeBob: Gary, I'm home! Gary? You here, buddy? [walks into the kitchen, realizing that the big pile of food is still there] Gary? [gasps] He hasn't touched his food! [runs over to Squidward's house screaming, and then knocks on the door] Squidward! Open up! [door opens by itself] Squidward, have you seen Gary? He's gone missing! [no answer] Squidward? Not a sign of Squidward anywhere. Squidward? [walks upstairs] You up here? Hmm, Squidward's clarinet. [puts the clarinet in his mouth a few times] It's not even warm. Squidward's missing, too! [runs over to Patrick's house] Patrick, open up! Squidward and Gary are missing! [lifts up rock, revealing that there's nobody there] Patrick's gone, too. What if everybody's gone?! [cuts to the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs! [gasp] He's gone, too! [cuts to Sandy's house] Sandy! She's gone. [Cut to SpongeBob walking out of five buildings, saying \"Gone\" each time he exits one. He then runs forward on the street, hyperventilating.] SpongeBob: Where did everybody go?! [wide shot of Bikini Bottom, where SpongeBob's voice echoes off a cliff] Everybody's gone! But I swear that I will keep the memory of Bikini Bottom alive, by living out their lives for them. [Cut to the next day, where SpongeBob is blowing a bubble of himself, then plays a record of him laughing. He then runs into Squidward's house, takes the form of Squidward, and imitates him.] SpongeBob: [imitating Squidward] SpongeBob, will you be quiet? You're disrupting my genius. [plays off-key notes on Squidward's clarinet. Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs, sir, can I have a raise?

[Bubble transition to SpongeBob taking the form of Old Man Jenkins and imitating him.] SpongeBob: [imitating Old Man Jenkins] Excuse me, sonny, may I have a Krabby Patty Deluxe please? [as Squidward, with normal voice] Right away, sir! [imitates Squidward] I mean... whatever. [sticks head in the kitchen] Hey, SpongeBob, we got an order for a Krabby Patty Deluxe. Heaven knows why. [giggles, then moves a box that looks like him] Coming up, Squidward! [Bubble transition to SpongeBob at Patrick's house where he is sleeping and snoring in Patrick's form. Bubble transition to Sandy's house.] SpongeBob: Excuse me, Sandy, but may I have some more of this delicious iced tea? [as Sandy] Why, sure! Whoops, just a sec. [grows a tail] Why sure now, SpongeBob. [Bubble transition to Mrs. Puff's Boating School, with SpongeBob as Mrs. Puff.] SpongeBob: [imitating Mrs. Puff] Good morning, class. Can anyone tell me the first thing you do when riding a boat? [as himself] Ahem, floor it? [as Mrs. Puff] That's right, you floor it. Excellent work, SpongeBob! [as himself] Why thank you, Mrs.... [sadly] Pu... Pu... Puff! [starts to cry] This is pointless! I'm no Mrs. Puff! I can't replace everyone! I'll never be happy again! [notices a stack of blank driver's licenses on the desk] Ooh, my driver's license! [Cut to SpongeBob, taking a picture of him to put in the license.] SpongeBob: That's the baby. [he then walks up to a boat] Hi, fella, it's me. [boat drives away, SpongeBob then pulls it back up] It's okay, I'm licensed. [SpongeBob gets in the boat and starts it up] Oh yeah, listen to that purr! La-la-la- [SpongeBob starts driving it around Bikini Bottom causing destruction] -la-la-la... [SpongeBob falls asleep and drives into Patrick's house, causing it to skid up, missing Squidward's house, and then crashes into the top floor of SpongeBob's house.] SpongeBob: [in bed] Good night, Boaty. [Cut to SpongeBob having nightmares and talking in his sleep.] SpongeBob: No. No! [wakes up and screams] No! [pants] Oh, Gary, I had a nightmare that all my friends were gone! And I was driving a-! [screams and notices that Boaty is right next to him in bed] So it was true! I... guess it's just you and me now, Boaty. [Scene cuts to him and Boaty taking a shower, then eating cereal, then crashing out of the pineapple riding it, then jellyfishing, then at the Goo Lagoon, then on the seesaw, then driving into the Krusty Krab.] SpongeBob: This is where I work. Do you want to help me cook up some Krabby Patties? [silence] Great! [puts a box of Krabby Patties under Boaty's tire, then moving it to get the patties on the grill] Back when everyone was around, they used to enjoy these. Here, try one. [throws a Krabby Patty under his hood, it then splatters everywhere] What? You don't like Krabby Patties? Huh! Well, I guess we can still make this work. [Scene cuts to SpongeBob driving Boaty into the pineapple.] SpongeBob: Whew. Boy, we learned a lot about each other today. You know? I thought I'd go crazy without all my friends and acquaintances around, but it looks like you were all I needed to stay sane! [Boaty rumbles] What? A puppet of my old best friend? [Boaty rumbles again] Made entirely out of Krabby Patty meat? [laughs] Oh, Boaty, you are a card. [walks into a closet, where he is talking to the puppet Boaty was talking about earlier] Sorry I'm late, Patrick. Boaty was telling me a joke. [SpongeBob sticks his hand in there and starts talking for him] Krabby Patty Patrick: You're awfully chummy with that guy for someone who has it out for you. SpongeBob: Who, Boaty? [giggles] Oh no. He's... Really? Krabby Patty Patrick: I can't talk now. He's watching us. SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick! Don't go! [notices Boaty is staring at him] Huh? Nothing! Boaty! I... I'm just going to bed. French Narrator: Three days later... SpongeBob: [writing in his diary] Dear diary, not sure if I can trust any vehicle. Run for it as soon as the coast is clear. [SpongeBob looks out of the plant he's hiding in, seeing there's no one there, walks into a closet, where Boaty comes in, SpongeBob screams and bursts through the wall of his house. He runs into another boat and screams] [runs into a boat rental and screams] [SpongeBob runs inside The Reef theater. Cut to inside one of the theater rooms, where SpongeBob looks around to make sure there is no Boaty. He pulls up some popcorn and turns to the screen, a movie about vehicles is being shown, and screams. SpongeBob runs out of the theater, and he grabs an ax and looks for Boaty. He sees a bus coming toward him and strikes at it with his ax. The bus stops, and everyone in Bikini Bottom steps out.] SpongeBob: Huh? Mr. Krabs: Sheesh. Calm down, boy. SpongeBob: You're all still alive? Well, where did you go? Mr. Krabs: It was National No SpongeBob Day. SpongeBob: National No SpongeBob Day? Mr. Krabs: Yeah. A whole day dedicated to getting away from you. SpongeBob: A day? But you guys have been gone for weeks. Mr. Krabs: Uhh... heh heh, yeah well... we kinda milked it a little. [Patrick comes out of the bus with balloons and a T-shirt with SpongeBob crossed out on it.] SpongeBob: You too, Patrick? Patrick: Yeah. Everyone needs at least one day away from... [imitates SpongeBob's laugh] SpongeBob: [sadly] Well, I'm... glad you had fun. [sobs] Mr. Krabs: Aww, cheer up, boy. It's a whole day inspired by you. SpongeBob: Really? Mr. Krabs: Of course. [cut to a flashback of everyone in Bikini Bottom except SpongeBob around a SpongeBob made of wood] First, we built a giant wooden effigy of you, then we burned it to the ground. [the citizens burn it] Whoo-hoo! Burn, baby! [cut to everyone dancing on the ashes of the effigy] And danced on the ashes like there was no tomorrow. [flashback ends] SpongeBob: Wow. A whole day dedicated to me. [blushes] Patrick: Big deal. Wait 'til you see \"No Patrick Day.\" Come on, everyone. Let's go! [Everyone gets on the bus.

He goes outside to investigate, only to find out that it is just Squidward breathing. Squidward then tells SpongeBob that he will pay him five dollars if he gives him peace and quiet for the rest of the day. However, Squidward already gave SpongeBob five dollars to leave him alone yesterday. He gets annoyed, so Squidward begins walking away. He then finds out that SpongeBob is following him, so he starts running and he jumps onto his boat. However, he cannot find the keys and then SpongeBob arrives at Squidward's boat. Squidward then becomes furious, only to find out that SpongeBob wanted to give him his keys. Squidward drives away and literally drives through a stop sign by accident. He gets pulled over by a police man, telling him that he needs to go to boating school to get his boating record clean.After that, the scene changes to Squidward walking up to Mrs. Puff's Boating School, and once he opens the door, he sees SpongeBob and then starts to cry. During class, Squidward is forced to sit next to SpongeBob. Then Mrs. Puff asks Squidward why he is enrolled in Boating School, so he tells everyone in the class while SpongeBob heavily breathes during this, annoying Squidward. After, Mrs. Puff tells SpongeBob to illustrate his side of the story, but SpongeBob just draws a picture with him and Squidward saying \"SpongeBob and Squidward, Best Boating Buddies Forever\" on the chalkboard, much to the confusion of the students and to Squidward's annoyance.Later, during lunchtime, Squidward tries to avoid SpongeBob. He then decides to eat in the bathroom, but he sees \"SpongeBob's\" feet. Furious, Squidward angrily throws his sandwich on the floor, bangs the door and yells at \"SpongeBob\", but when it opens, it is revealed to not be SpongeBob, but rather, a tough guy. Squidward awkwardly freaks out that he thought it was SpongeBob and gets beaten up, offscreen. He arrives back in class with SpongeBob, and Mrs. Puff tells him that he has to drive with SpongeBob for a test. So, they get inside a boat and SpongeBob is the driver. However, he drives out of control and crashes into a research lab. There, he, Squidward, and Mrs. Puff shrink and get washed down the drain. SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff end up in a water fountain back at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, while Squidward ends up in the bathroom and gets beaten up again.The scene changes to everyone back in class. Mrs. Puff explains that everyone is going to do a test. But when SpongeBob tries to help him, an angry Squidward snaps at him exclaiming that they are not \"Boating Buddies,\" and he never wants help from him ever again. SpongeBob's feelings are hurt. However, Squidward cannot do the test because he cannot pick up the pencil since it is all bandaged up, so he asks for SpongeBob's help; when the sponge reminds him of what he said, Squidward denies it, only for his voice to have been recorded by another student. Finally, when Squidward admits that he and SpongeBob are \"Boating Buddies,\" and stated he said that before they became \"Boating Buddies\" and SpongeBob cheers. But time runs out and Squidward asks Mrs. Puff what to do. She then says that he needs to come back the next week to retake the test. Squidward finds out that SpongeBob also failed the test, and he has to come back the next week too, causing Squidward to scream, ending the episode.","musics":["Frankenstein's Niece A","Lap Steel","Wig Struck","Steel Licks 44","Nude Sting","Monster Wave Full Mix","Steel Licks 78","Lonely Stranger","Skipping to School","Hawaiian Cocktail","Concerto Grosso in E Major Op. 8 No. 1 \"The Spring\": I.

Inside, SpongeBob is brushing Gary's shell.] SpongeBob: 97, 98, 99, 100. Okay, Gary, let's do the other side now. Gary, can you hear that? [Gary is confused, then SpongeBob walks outside, and over to Squidward] Oh, Squidward, it's you. I thought I heard something. Squidward: SpongeBob, I've been sitting here motionless for 45 minutes. What could you possibly have heard me doing? SpongeBob: Breathing. Squidward: SpongeBob, I will give you $5 if you let me enjoy the rest of my morning, in peace. SpongeBob: [half of his head flips open while he talks] Okay! [Squidward takes out his wallet] Squidward: Hey, I could have sworn I had $5 in here. SpongeBob: I have it, Squidward, you gave it to me to leave you alone yesterday. [Squidward gets up] Squidward, you can have the $5 back. Mr. Krabs says-- Squidward: I don't care what Mr. Krabs says! I just want-- [bangs on the table, and the liquid in his cup spills on him] SpongeBob: Coffee rain! Squidward: It's hot chocolate. [walks away] SpongeBob: Chocolate rain! [Squidward is still walking] Squidward! [Squidward runs screaming] Squidward, wait! [scene then shows both of them running for a while, then Squidward gets to his boat. Tries to open it but can't.] Squidward: It's locked! SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward! [Squidward screams, then jumps in the boat, then tries to start it but it won't start] Squidward: Huh? [realizes the key isn't there] The key! Oh, where did I put that stupid... SpongeBob: [as he is yelling, Squidward is searching] Squidward! Squidward! Squidward: Oh, why can't I just find that-? [SpongeBob makes it to the boat] SpongeBob: Squidward? Squidward: [yells in SpongeBob's face as usual] What?! SpongeBob: You left your keys on the table back there. [Squidward starts the boat] Hey, Squidward? Squidward: Yes? SpongeBob: Didn't you used to have one of those cucumber bicycles? Squidward: Oh. [laughs] That was a recumbent bicycle, and I sold it. SpongeBob: Why? Squidward: So I could get further away from you! [rushes off and drives away laughing. Pebbles are flying onto SpongeBob's face. SpongeBob is now entirely covered in pebbles and lifts his right arm to wave goodbye to Squidward.] SpongeBob: Okay, I'll see you later then, Squidward. Squidward: Bon voyage, nincompoop! [as he looks back on SpongeBob, he drives through a stop sign, and then sees in the rearview mirror that he's being followed by a police car] What the? [pulls over, then the policeman walks up] Can I help you, officer? Policeman: [the stop sign Squidward crashed into is on his head] No, but you can help yourself to this ticket. Squidward: [gasps] Ticket? Officer, please! I have impeccable boat smarts! I pride myself in obtaining an un-soiled driving record! It's all that I have! Policeman: Well, you can have it again, right after you complete boating school. [drives off] Squidward: Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo...? [Bubble transition to Mrs. Puff's boating school, where Squidward is walking] Squidward: Boating school. Blegh. [knocks on door] Oh, well, it's just one day out of your life, Squiddy. How bad can it be? [SpongeBob opens the door] SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward! [Squidward cries, then the bell rings] Mrs. Puff: Good morning, class. Would everyone please take a seat? [SpongeBob sits] SpongeBob: Psst. Squidward, sit here. Here. Squidward: Um, excuse me, there doesn't seem to be any empty seats left. Mrs. Puff: But there's one right next to SpongeBob. [Squidward sits down. SpongeBob touches Squidward] Squidward: Do you mind? SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. We're boating buddies now! I'll teach you everything I know, and then we can- Squidward: \"We\" won't be doing anything, because there is no we ! Understand? Mrs. Puff: Quiet in the front, please. SpongeBob: Oh, I understand. I understand perfectly, [winks at Squiward] boating buddy. Mrs. Puff: Okay class, how about we get to know our new students, by telling each other why we were sentenced to- I mean why we are enrolled in boating school. Student: Um, I got caught speeding. Mrs. Puff: Very good. Next. Student: I don't see what's so very good about it. Mrs. Puff: No, I didn't mean very... Student: [sighs] I know exactly what you meant. Mrs. Puff: Next. SpongeBob: I am here because I- Mrs. Puff: We all know why you're here, SpongeBob. What about you, sir? [referring to Squidward] Squidward: Me? Mrs. Puff: Yes. Would you like to tell the rest of the class, why you're with us today? Squidward: Why I'm- [notices SpongeBob is staring at him while breathing heavily] All right, I'll tell you. I was trying to get away....from him! [SpongeBob continues breathing] He is the bane of my existence! Mrs. Puff: Yours too? Uhh... what I meant to say was, please come up to the chalkboard and draw a diagram of the incident. Squidward: Gladly. [begins drawing what he is saying] It all started when I left my house. [adds some dots to the drawing of his house] And then, he appeared. [frustratedly makes a drawing of SpongeBob] He made an immediate right turn and parked here. [referring to Squidward's house] Seeing the oncoming hazard, I looked both ways and proceeded safely toward my vehicle. It was then, that I realized that I was being followed at an unsafe distance. So, in order to create more optimal driving conditions, I was forced to then par-take in [screeches the chalk board] evasive action. And by increasing speed slightly, I created a safety cushion, while inadvertently attracting the attention of said law enforcement official. May I sit down now, sweet cheeks? Mrs. Puff: Why, certainly. And perhaps now, SpongeBob would like to come up and illustrate his side of the story. Squidward: His side?! SpongeBob: Well, first, I started over here. And then I went wayyyyyyy over here. Do-do-do-do, like that. Then, I went around like this, and over here like that, and across this lane, and down here like this, and then... [continues writing, without SpongeBob's speaking being heard as Vivaldi's \"The Four Seasons\" plays in the background] ...and then I went around and stopped right here. Everyone: [reading the blackboard] “SpongeBob and Squidward, best boating buddies, forever”? [all are confused, then SpongeBob sits down] SpongeBob: Do you like it, Squidward? Squidward: Shut it. [the bell rings] [Bubble transition to everyone eating lunch. SpongeBob, holding a lunch tray with a hot dog and grape juice, is sitting next to Squidward, who is eating a sandwich.] SpongeBob: Ah, lunch time, eh, boating buddy? [sits down while Squidward walks away, over to the trash cans] Squidward: I'll have to eat over here, like in grade school. [is about to eat, then SpongeBob pops up from a trash can] SpongeBob: Squidward, do you have any mustard in there? [Squidward runs away screaming] [Bubble transition to the bathroom, where Squidward is eating the sandwich.] Squidward: Mmm, Bon appétit, Squiddy. [is about to eat, but then hears a flush. He then sees what appears to be SpongeBob's feet in the other stall. Squidward growls angrily, walks out of the bathroom stall, and throws his sandwich on the ground. He then starts pounding his fist on the door of the stall thinking that SpongeBob was seen in.] You've ruined my morning, you've ruined my lunch, and you're ruining my... [door opens, revealing that it's a muscular tough fish reading \"The Daily Chronical\" newspaper, with feet that look like SpongeBob's. Squidward freaks out as the muscular fish comes right at him. The scene cuts to Squidward walking to his seat, bandaged up.] Mrs. Puff: Okay, class, it's time for our behind the wheel lesson. Squidward, you'll be riding with SpongeBob. Squidward: Eh, didn't see that coming. [Bubble transition to Mrs. Puff, Squidward, and SpongeBob in a boat at the starting line.] Mrs. Puff: Now, we're going to take this nice and slow. SpongeBob, what do we do when pulling away from the curb? SpongeBob: Uh, step on the gas? Mrs. Puff: Good. Nice and easy. Now let's slowly... [SpongeBob pushes the gas pedal too hard, and Mrs. Puff screams.] Squidward: SpongeBob, look out! [they bump through the cones, then they barge out through the fence, then they go through a red light, he then gives the wheel] SpongeBob, give me that wheel! SpongeBob: I got it, I got it. [they fight over it] Squidward: Don't... just let go of it! [the steering wheel breaks, and Mrs. Puff panics. They make a sharp right turn, barely missing grandma.] Grandma: Hooligans! [Mrs. Puff, Squidward, and SpongeBob scream as they drive through the Barg'N-Mart. The three, holding a turkey, a pair of carrots, and a milk carton, respectively, continue to scream as they ran into the Costume Supplies shop as the toaster oven times-up bell sounds. The three are now dressed up as a witch with an axe, a chef, and a gorilla, respectively. They then scream as they drive into the Top Secret Laboratory and Research Facility.] Scientist 1: Johnson, I finally figured out a way to shrink an ordinary mailman, down to the size of a grain of sand. Scientist 2: But how? Scientist 1: By using this shrink ray. [pulls a lever that turns it on, then the boat comes in, and they get shrunk instead] Scientist 2: Mother of mercy! [they shrink] Where'd they go? Scientist 1: There! They're heading right for that discarded potato chip. [the mailman growls] Scientist 2: What's the matter? Scientist 1: Potato chips are his favorite snack. [The mailman breaks out] Scientist 1: Johnson! No! [The mailman takes the chip and is about to eat it, but then gets sprayed with water by the second scientist.] Scientist 2: No, no, no. [The chip drops on the floor and breaks in half, then Mrs. Puff, SpongeBob, and Squidward make a break for it into a drain. The scene then cuts to a cowboy heading to a water drinking fountain, but as he starts drinking out of it, Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob come out of it and return to their normal sizes.] Cowboy: I never will understand these city folk. SpongeBob: Hey, where'd Squidward go? [The scene cuts to the tough fish from earlier whistling while entering a bathroom stall, locking the lock until he hears Squidward returning to normal size in the toilet, making the fish furious at him.] Squidward: [nervously sweating] I was just leaving. [The scene cuts to SpongeBob back in the classroom until he hears and see Squidward enter the room all bandaged up with crutches.] Mrs. Puff: Okay class, it's time to take our final exam. Please have your pencils ready. SpongeBob: Pst, hey, boating buddy? [Squidward looks at him] If you need any help, I've taken this test hundreds of times... [Squidward cuts him off] Squidward: [furious] How many times do I have to tell you?! I am not your buddy! I don't need your help, [close-up of his face] and I don't need you! Ever! Now, just kindly let me take this stupid test, so I can get out of here and never have to see you again for the rest of my life! SpongeBob: [sadly] Okay, Squidward, if that's the way you want it. Squidward: Thank you. [tries to pick up his pencil, then picks it up in both hands, but then it drops and rolls out the room] Mrs. Puff: 3 more minutes, class. Squidward: SpongeBob? SpongeBob, I need your help. Mrs. Puff: 2 more minutes. Squidward: SpongeBob, please? This is important. SpongeBob: You said you didn't need my help, Squidward, and that you didn't need me. Squidward: No, no, I didn't. I never said that. [a student plays back what Squidward said] I don't need your help, and I don't need you! [now talking] Jerk. [the student shrugs] All right, I said it. But that was before. SpongeBob: Before what? Squidward: [nervously] Before-- before-- Mrs. Puff: 1 more minute, class. Squidward: Before we were... [gulps] boating buddies. SpongeBob: Yay! Mrs. Puff: Okay, class, time's up. Squidward: Time can't be up! I didn't even get a chance to fill in a single answer! What am I supposed to do? Mrs. Puff: You do the same thing that everybody else does who failed the test. You take it again next week. Squidward: Next week? SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I've never gotten one answer right on this test. But we'll meet again next week, at Mrs. Puff's Boating School! [The scene cuts to the camera zooming out from the exterior of the boating school.

[lands in blue gunk, camera pans out to show surroundings, as well as the sign to show where he is] The tar pits? [sinks] Ah! I'm sinking! [spits out tar] Well, I guess this is the end, SquarePants. But like the old saying goes, \"Better to end up sinking into a prehistoric lake of tar, then to turn to a life of crime!\" Goodbye, world. Goodbye, Mrs. Puff. I'll always cherish those last kind words that you said to me. [thinks] Mrs. Puff: Make sure you return that bathroom key to my desk or you're in big trouble mister! SpongeBob: [sinks all the way in. Camera stays at tar pits for a while, before SpongeBob's tar-covered hand pops up with the bathroom key, also covered in tar] SpongeBob: [walks up from the tar, losing the tar from where he pops up] Ohh I never returned Mrs. Puff's bathroom key! I can't give up now! Crowd: SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob: [pulls onto a prehistoric animal's tusk, and is flung face-first into the wall.

[Tries walking through the door, but ends up running into Mrs. Puff] Mrs. Puff... I'm really sorry! Please forgive me! I don't know what happened! Everything just got away from me! [Holds up bathroom key] I brought back your bathroom key, though! Mrs. Puff: I haven't the foggiest idea of what you're carrying on about SpongeBob, but I don't have time for it. I've got my own problems. [Two police officers show up behind her, and cuff her] Johnny Law finally caught up to me for ditching jury duty. Let this be a lesson to you, son...never ditch! SpongeBob: Okay Mrs. Puff, I'll never ditch again! Mrs. Puff: That's a good boy, SpongeBob. Good... Again?! What do you mean, again?!?

All of the students were crowding around asking for his autograph. Mrs. Puff tells them that he shall receive no special attention. Right after that, she asked him for his autograph. Tony Fast Jr. is shown to be excellent at driving, which gives Mrs. Puff the idea to have him teach SpongeBob how to drive. During the test, Tony Fast Jr. explains to SpongeBob that he should relax, and this advice allows SpongeBob to drive better. He softens his foot on the gas pedal and goes around a corner. He successfully finishes the course and Mrs. Puff is relieved that she may not have to deal with him for much longer.Tony Jr. is walking on the boardwalk when SpongeBob comes up to him because he is eager to learn more from him. Tony states that he won't be able to teach him at the Boating School, but invites him to his home so he can learn. SpongeBob is at the gates of the Fast family's house and presses the button on the speaker. He is let in and Tony is on a unicycle. Both of his parents aren't home so Tony offers to show him his father's vintage speedboat collection. SpongeBob is amazed by all of the shiny speedboats and Tony asks him to pick his favorite. He chooses a flaming red speedboat and Tony asks if he wants to go for a ride in it.SpongeBob is driving the boat as Tony is on a hang glider that is attached to the boat. SpongeBob is nervous about driving and Tony tries to keep him calm so he doesn't crash again. He almost runs over a fish as his nerves start kicking in. He lets go of the steering wheel as Tony tells him to go faster. He lets go of the brakes and they go even faster. SpongeBob spots a red light and immediately stops the boat. Three fish are in a speedboat right next to them as they challenge them to a race. SpongeBob checks his schedule for any conflicts, and then accepts the challenge. However, after considering safety concerns he decides to decline the challenge. Tony Jr. is frustrated and calls it an embarrassment if they don't accept the challenge. Both race teams get ready as the traffic light changes to green. They take off throughout the town and SpongeBob starts gaining the lead. He presses harder on the gas pedal to get past his opponent again and the boat catches in flames as they pass Larry the Lobster. Larry catches the flames and gets an instant tan. Their opponents quickly slow down when they notice police nearby. SpongeBob is still going fast as they pass the police and they start after them.SpongeBob is freaking out and is unsure what to do as the sirens make it so Tony Jr. can't hear him. A police helicopter starts following them as well. Tony Fast Sr. is in his speedboat listening to the radio as a news story about the car chase comes on. The chase goes right by him and he starts chasing after SpongeBob and Tony Jr. He is angry as SpongeBob and Tony Jr. are clueless as to what they should do. Tony Jr. tries to calm SpongeBob once again and he declines his advice this time due to where it has gotten them. He drives through the sign of the Boating school and runs into Mrs. Puff as she inflates. Back in the classroom, Mrs. Puff is in a wheelchair and informs the class that Tony Jr. is no longer with them, and was transferred to another school. She also says that SpongeBob should never be let to drive, as the episode ends.","musics":["Bad to the Spongebone","Sponge surf no guit mel","Proud to be a Fish","Beach Party","record scratches SFX","Bad to the Spongebone Alt","Monster Wave Full Mix","Dramatic Cue (E)","Bikini Bottom News Theme","Beach Bunny from Miyazaki","Sneaky Buns","Tymp Boing","The Achterhoek Dances","Saxaboogie","Grass Skirt Chase","Sponge surf Vib end sax up","New Vibe Hits","Parting of the Clouds Sting","Rescue","Horlepiep"],"transcript":"[the episode begins with SpongeBob coming into Mrs. Puff's Boating School] SpongeBob: [singing and running] ♪Going on down to Boating School!

SpongeBob: It's nice to finally meet you Tony Fast Jr! [pants happily] Tony Jr.: I said let's roll! SpongeBob: [sweating frantically] Okay! Uh, roll? Roll!? Roll!? Is there a button for that? [starts pushing random button on the front of the boat] I know I know this! It's around here somewhere! I- Tony Jr.: Just drive! SpongeBob: Just driving! [slams down on the gas pedal driving quickly in which both SpongeBob and Tony Jr. scream as SpongeBob tries to drive the boat] W-w-w-what do these dotted lines mean? Tony Jr.: Relax, man. You gotta relax. SpongeBob: Relax... relax? Mrs. Puff hasn't taught us that yet! Tony Jr.: No, I mean just relax man... SpongeBob: Okay... just relaxing... and... relaxing! Relaxing! So hard! [his eye lids shatter] Raw! I can't relax! Tony Jr.: No, no, no. Not like that. You just gotta let go. SpongeBob: Let go? Tony Jr.: Be... cool... SpongeBob: Be cool? Tony Jr.: Be... cool... SpongeBob: Be... cool... [softly has his foot on the gas pedal as he drives perfectly around the corner and around the anchor] Cool... [drives up and down the road hill and finishes the course] Tony Jr.: Not bad, dude, not bad. Suzy: Gasp! It's a miracle! Harold: [on his knees] Neptune be praised! Mrs. Puff: That went better than expected! Oh! If Tony Jr. can keep this up, then SpongeBob might even graduate and I'll be rid of him forever! Forever! [laughs] Forever! Tony Jr.: Okay Bro-Jangles! Catch you... [jumps and flips off of the boat landing perfectly on the ground] ...on the flipside! [snaps and then gets picked up by Mrs. Puff] What the? [Mrs. Puff kisses him on the cheek] [Cuts back to Tony Jr. walking on the boardwalk] Tony Jr.: [stops walking and notices SpongeBob] Yeah, what is it? Can't you see I'm walking here? SpongeBob: I can see that! And I'm eager to learn more from you! Tony Jr.: Eager? SpongeBob: Yeah! Tony Jr.: I can't teach you anything more at this square school, no offense, SquarePants. SpongeBob: None taken! Tony Jr.: Well, if you really wanna learn more, you can come by my house later! [walks off] SpongeBob: Oh! I'll be delighted to! [Cuts to SpongeBob outside of the gates of Tony Fast and Tony Jr.'s house] SpongeBob: [presses the button on the speaker] Tony Jr.: Who is it? SpongeBob: It's SpongeBob SquarePants! Tony Jr.: Who? SpongeBob: SpongeBob, SquarePants! [the gates open and Tony Jr. appears on a unicycle] Tony Fast Jr.! Tony Jr.: Guy from school! Come on in! SpongeBob: [inside the house] Nice place you got here, Tony Jr.! Tony Jr.: Thanks! Lived here all my life! My mom and dad are out. SpongeBob: Oh! Uh, what does that mean? Tony Jr.: It means... you wanna see my dad's vintage speedboat collection? SpongeBob: Oh, would I? [cuts to Tony Fast's gararge showing many speedboats] Tony Jr.: And he took first place in this beauty surpassing speed records held by both Francis Baconskin Jr. and Smitty Tailpipe Rockama! SpongeBob: Wow! They're so shiny! Tony Jr.: Pick your favorite! SpongeBob: My favorite? Oh, I couldn't! Tony Jr.: Why, sure you can! What's the big- SpongeBob: [points to a red speedboat with flames on the front and with the number 8 on it] This one! Tony Jr.: Huh? The Batonia Classic! Excellent choice! [grabs the keys to the Batonia Classic] Want to take her for a spin? SpongeBob: A spin? But we don't even have boating licenses! Tony Jr.: [in the speedboat] You don't need a boating license for a raceboat, SquarePants! [Bubble transition to SpongeBob driving the Batonia Classic] SpongeBob: Wow, Tony Jr.! She handles like a dream! It's like I'm floating air! Tony Jr.: [on a hanglider flying as a rope is keeping him tied to the speedboat] You're telling me! SpongeBob: Are you sure you're comfortable with me driving, though? I admit I'm feeling a little nervous... Tony Jr.: I wouldn't if I were you! Remember, it was your nerves that made us almost crash before! SpongeBob: Hah... my nerves! I almost forgot about... my nerves! [starts driving nervously almost running over a fish] Sorry sir! Tony Jr.: Just let go! [lets go of the hanglider but grabs back onto it] Phew... SpongeBob: Let go... got it! [lets go of the steering wheel and drives around a curve] Whee! Tony Jr.: Go faster, SpongeBob! SpongeBob: Faster? Tony Jr.: Just let go! Of the brakes! SpongeBob: Eh... if you say so! [sticks up  his foot higher letting go of the brake and going even faster around more curves] Whee! [goes down the street] Whee! [goes over a loop] Whee! Tony Jr.: Now you're getting it! SpongeBob: Whee... red light! [notices the light turning red] Tony Jr.: Ah! SpongeBob: [instantly stops the boat] Tony Jr.: Real cool, SquarePants... [now beside SpongeBob in the boat] SpongeBob: Thanks, TFJ... [notices three fish in another speedboat beside them] Street Racer: That's quite a fancy speed boat you got right there! For a couple of squares! Female Passenger: What he said! [all three laugh] SpongeBob: Thank you! And may I say how lovely your speed boat is, too! For a bunch of circles! And by circles, I mean well-rounded individuals! [laughs] Street Racer: Well, wise guy, eh? Well then, how about you wise up to an unfriendly competition? Right here, right now! Female Passenger: Yeah! What he said! SpongeBob: Right here, right now? A little short notice... [takes out a small book] let me check my availability. [looks in the book] Let's see... right now... looks like I don't have anything scheduled for right now. Therefore, I would like to accept your challenge! Tony Jr.: Yes! SpongeBob: However! Certain safety concerns prevent me from doing so! Therefore, I must decline! Tony Jr.: SquarePants! I can't believe what I'm hearing here! SpongeBob: [tries to listen for something] I don't hear anything. Tony Jr.: [face-palm] Ah... look kid! Being cool includes accepting this challenge! Anything less would be an embarrassment! SpongeBob: I would never want to embarrass you, Tony Jr. Therefore, I accept your challenge! Street Racer: Oh, it's on! Female Passenger: What he said! Street Racer: Do you mind? [Both racers get ready as the red light changes to green and they both take off through the town. They pass fish in which they rip their clothes off and onto another. SpongeBob starts to get the lead.] Street Racer: Huh? [speeds up passed SpongeBob and Tony Jr.] Hah hah! Female Passenger: What he said! SpongeBob: Grr... Grr! [presses down harder on the gas pedal which starts to catch in flames as he speeds passed Larry the Lobster burning him] Larry: Sweet! Instant tannage! [SpongeBob catches up to the male race driver as they continue to drive beside each other] SpongeBob: [growls] Grr! Street Racer: [laughs until the female passenger points out to him, his eyes go through his glasses as there is a sign saying \"Click It or Ticket\" with police near by, then goes quick and slows down] SpongeBob: We're winning! We're winning! [SpongeBob and Tony Jr. laugh as they speed passed the police car] Policeman 1: Whoa! Did you see that? Policeman 2: That guy wasn't just going fast... Both: ...He was going Tony Fast! SpongeBob: [notices the police car] Huh? Oh, no! The cops are after us! What are we going to do? Tony Jr.: What? Sorry, I couldn't hear you over that siren. [A police helicopter now follows them] SpongeBob: Now there's a helicopter after us! Tony Jr.: What's that? I couldn't hear you over that helicopter! [Tony Fast is in his speedboat listening to the news on his radio] Newsman: And in other news, son of racing legend, Tony Fast is currently involved in a high speed chase, it is rumored that the... [SpongeBob and Tony Jr. drive passed Tony Fast with the police car and police helicopter still following them] Tony Fast: What the? SpongeBob: What're we going to do!? [notices Tony Fast in the mirror chasing them] Tony Fast: Tony Jr! When I get my hands on you, I'm gonna- SpongeBob: Now your dad is after us! Tony Jr.: Sorry, I couldn't hear you, my... my... my dad is after us?! What are we gonna do?! SpongeBob: How should I know? He's your dad! Tony Jr.: Well, just remember my advice, okay? All you got to do is let go... be cool... [the camera closely focus on SpongeBob's eyes] Let go... be cool... SpongeBob: [annoyed] Do you see where letting go has gotten us so far?! Huh?! Tony Jr?! [pants heavily] Tony Jr.: No, but I see where it's getting us next! SpongeBob: [notices quickly, screams, then drives through the sign of Mrs. Puff's Boating School and ends up on Mrs. Puff as she inflates] [Cuts to the inside of the classroom] Mrs. Puff: Well, class, I regret to inform you that Tony Jr. is no longer with us. Crowd: Gasp! Mrs. Puff: He was transferred to another school. However, I think maybe Tony Jr. taught us all a valuable lesson... SpongeBob: [on a hospital bed] Oh! Oh! Oh! Never argue and drive? Mrs. Puff: Close... the lesson is: [zoom out to reveal her injuries] Never let you drive!","url_transcript":"https:\/\/spongebob.fandom.com\/wiki\/The_Hot_Shot\/transcript"}]
