He's eager to get ready for the day that he is to apply for a fry cook job at the Krusty Krab. He warms up by lifting a weight with stuffed animals before jogging to the restaurant with his iconic \"I'm ready!\", while Patrick Star encourages him from his rock.SpongeBob starts talking about what job he will do when he reaches the Krusty Krab, but feels like his reach is not ready. Patrick then appears, encouraging him that he was born to have a job. SpongeBob eventually decides to go to the Krusty Krab to get the job. Squidward sees SpongeBob running to the restaurant, causing him to panic and to tell Mr. Krabs to watch out for SpongeBob.SpongeBob has already arrived, though, and he tries to get Mr. Krabs to give him the job after jumping back and forth across the restaurant after tripping on a loose nail. He tells Mr. Krabs that Squidward will vouch for him, but Squidward tells Mr. Krabs that he does not believe SpongeBob should get the job. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob that if he gets a seemingly nonexistent hydro-dynamic spatula, he will get the job. SpongeBob quickly runs to the Barg'N-Mart to get it, as Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh, thinking he will not have the job.Soon after SpongeBob leaves, five buses filled with a bunch of hungry anchovies arrive at the restaurant, making Squidward and Mr. Krabs panic, as the latter knows what happens when anchovies come. As the anchovies flood the restaurant, Squidward tries to get them all settled, but they're still crazy. It seems the two are both finished due to the flood of anchovies, but then SpongeBob arrives with the hydrodynamic spatula he found (as there was only one in stock), having fulfilled the errand Mr. Krabs gave him and leaving the two in stunned surprise. SpongeBob goes into the kitchen and, in a montage accompanied by Tiny Tim's \"Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight,\" cooks many Krabby Patties then tosses them to all the hungry anchovies until they all feel satisfied and leave the restaurant.Mr. Krabs recruits SpongeBob as a fry cook thanks to him saving the Krusty Krab from the anchovies, much to Squidward's chagrin, then goes to his office to count the day's profits. Then, Patrick walks into the restaurant and order a Krabby Patty, prompting SpongeBob to create a slew of patties and chuck them all at him, flinging the former out. Squidward tells Mr. Krabs to go see SpongeBob and possibly get him in trouble for the mess he made.", "musics": ["Glissando (A)", "Next Door Neighbour", "Battle at Sea", "Aloha O\u00e9", "The Rake Hornpipe", "Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight", "Buffoonery", "Death Trap [#27]", "Reach for the Stars", "The Main Event", "Bartmania A", "Menace from the Deep", "Grand Orchestral Fanfare", "Timpani Roll [#48]", "The Land Is Ours", "Hawaiian Train", "Sponge Bob Theme", "Honolulu March", "Oyster Girls", "Bossa Cubana", "Cymbals [#85]"]},

He kicks the shell onto SpongeBob's yard to keep his own clean, but SpongeBob is also very protective of his lawn, and gets out a reef blower from his garage to get rid of it, the noise of the machinery making Squidward irritated. SpongeBob, struggling to blow away the shell, ends up blowing it so hard sand comes out and lands on Squidward. SpongeBob comes to Squidward and blows off the sand that landed on Squidward, as well as his face. Seeing that there is a huge pile of sand on his yard, SpongeBob sets the blower to reverse, sucking up the sand pile, but the reef blower starts to break apart and throws out sand.SpongeBob opens up the zipper behind the reef blower and puts the excess sand that was thrown out in there. He tries to start it again, but it does not work. This prompts SpongeBob to pull the handle of the reef blower very far. Once he feels he is far enough, he lets go and quickly zips through the distance he went back onto the blower. SpongeBob starts sucking up the entire ocean, causing Squidward to almost suffocate to death, but the reef blower explodes due to over capacity and shoots all the water sucked up back out again. SpongeBob is happy that his lawn is clean, but Squidward's lawn is filled with sand.

SpongeBob stops for a time, takes a few tentative taps of his hammer, and then quickly finishes construction before Squidward has a chance to complain again.At the newly built stand, SpongeBob offers customers an opportunity to blow a bubble for twenty-five cents. Patrick comes by and asks to try it out. Though he does not have any money, he \"borrows\" a quarter from SpongeBob to pay for it. Unfortunately, Patrick's strained blowing fails to produce a bubble. SpongeBob offers to teach him for an extra quarter, which he happily \"loans\" to Patrick. SpongeBob then demonstrates his somewhat peculiar, yet effective, bubble-blowing technique, which produces a variety of bubble shapes, including a massive elephant-shaped bubble that gets stuck in Squidward's house and pops.The fuming Squidward comes out and approaches the now ostensibly closed bubble stand. He demands to know how they can cause so much disruption just by blowing bubbles. SpongeBob explains that he is creating art and utilizing his technique to its fullest potential. Squidward scoffs at SpongeBob's ideas of art and marketing, sending SpongeBob and Patrick back to their homes in a sad mood. Still snickering, Squidward begins to examine the bubble wand out of growing curiosity. As he tries to blow a bubble himself, SpongeBob quickly comes out and tells Squidward to pay a quarter, shocking him. Squidward reluctantly lays down a quarter for the bubble, suggesting that it is a very simple feat.Squidward attempts to impress the two with his skill, to no avail. All the while, SpongeBob and Patrick try to convince him to use the technique. Fed up and annoyed, Squidward furiously and mockingly copies their technique then screams into the wand in anger, which produces a giant bubble that impresses SpongeBob and Patrick.Squidward, claiming credit for the bubble he blew, heads back inside his house and plays his clarinet once more, with SpongeBob and Patrick chanting his name while dancing. However, the giant bubble descends and encapsulates Squidward's house, unearthing it and floating with it up in the air as SpongeBob and Patrick watch in horror and try to call Squidward's name to get his attention.When at last Squidward looks outside to greet his \"fans,\" he sees himself high above the ground with SpongeBob and Patrick little more than specks. The bubble then pops with explosive force, prompting SpongeBob and Patrick to look at each other nervously and retreat to their houses. Once Squidward's house floats back down to the ground, Squidward lets out a few final feeble notes from his clarinet.", "musics": ["Squid Clarinet25", "Old Hilo March", "Closing Theme 2", "Hawaiian Cocktail", "Maui Beach", "Ups And Downs (D)", "The Rake Hornpipe", "Squidwerd Clarinet #6", "Drum Rolls (B)", "Squid Clarinet27", "Squid Clarinet24", "Menace from the Deep", "12th St Rag Slo", "Timpani Roll [#48]", "Moloka'i Nui A", "Entry of the Gladiators", "Merlins Hill", "Side Drum [#52]", "Watch Out!", "Honolulu March", "Baby Elephant"]},

Squidward sends SpongeBob an order for a Krabby Patty, which through a sleight-of-hand trick SpongeBob performs seems to come out through Squidward's nose. After SpongeBob cooks the patty, however, it begins to move across the floor seemingly on its own and makes its way towards the front door. Mr. Krabs stops the patty in its tracks and reveals that the patty was being stolen by none other than Krabs' diminutive nemesis, Plankton. Krabs places his foe on a plate and flings him back to the Chum Bucket across the street while Plankton exclaims that he will return. Mr. Krabs explains to SpongeBob that Plankton is his arch-competitor, and has been trying and failing to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula for an untold amount of years.Later that night, after the Krusty Krab closes, SpongeBob says goodbye to Mr. Krabs and leaves. On his way home, Plankton stops SpongeBob and tries to convince him that he and the fry cook are somehow friends (or should be since they are both invertebrates), and that as such SpongeBob should come to Plankton's birthday, which he claims is the following day. Plankton gives SpongeBob a golden spatula and says that, \"friends give each other gifts.\" SpongeBob then guesses that Plankton would like a booster seat. Plankton sounds happy with this proposition, but declines. Plankton tells SpongeBob that, for his birthday, he wants SpongeBob to give him a Krabby Patty. SpongeBob loudly and angrily refuses, citing that Plankton just wants to make friends with him in order to gain access to the Krabby Patty. He also feels sure that Plankton's birthday was not going to even be the following day, and runs back home, refusing to give Plankton a Krabby Patty whether they become friends or not. Plankton, however, refuses to give up and proclaims that SpongeBob will \"hand-deliver it to [him] personally.\"Later that night, as SpongeBob is sleeping, Plankton maliciously enters his head through a pore and makes his way to SpongeBob's brain. He attaches a mind control device to the brain and hijacks SpongeBob's mind and body, forcing him to walk out of his house and through Squidward's house, where he insults the cephalopod. At this point, SpongeBob realizes that Plankton has hijacked his body and tries to tell him to let him go, but Plankton refuses, laughs sadistically, and makes SpongeBob exit the house, leaving Squidward feeling nauseous by what he just saw. After Plankton forces SpongeBob to pass through Patrick's house and tosses him aside, he then forces the sponge into and out of the Krusty Krab where he steals a Krabby Patty. He brings it to an analyzer inside the Chum Bucket, which is designed to figure out the ingredients of whatever is dropped into it. As Plankton cruelly gloats over his victory and begins to force SpongeBob to drop the Krabby Patty, SpongeBob sadly laments his failure to protect it, lovingly describing the Krabby Patty's ingredients and succulence. A hungry Plankton leaps out of SpongeBob's head and onto the Krabby Patty, but bounces off of it and falls into the analyzer, thus trapping himself inside his own computer screen. With his mind and body now freed from Plankton's control, SpongeBob happily walks home with the Krabby Patty in hand, ignoring Plankton's angry demands for him to bring it back, his last plea being, \"I'll settle for some fries!\" ending the episode shortly after.", "musics": ["House Of Horror [#10.3]", "Phantom Train", "Panic Stricken", "Maui Beach", "The Nightmare Begins (A)", "Enter the Villain", "Hawaiian Link (B)", "Grass Skirts Blowing (Hilo March)", "Verve", "Holiday Dream", "Heavenly Voices (A)", "Monks (C)", "Shock (R)", "House Of Horror [#10.2]", "Chill Out", "Titi De Paris", "Shock (U)", "The Tip Top Polka/The Cliff Polka", "Black Stockings", "Drama Link (D)", "Death Trap [#27.02]", "The Alphabet Song (A)", "Background Blues", "Haunted Surf"]},

Squidward sees that they are having a private conversation with bubbles. They whisper a message into the bubble wand instead of blowing into it, and when the bubble pops, the recipient can hear the message.Annoyed by this, Squidward comes up with a foolproof plan to make SpongeBob his friend in exchange for his betrayal to Patrick. As the first phase, he makes bubbles of his own using a biproduct from his souffl\u00e9, and proceeds to insult the two while (sometimes) imitating their voices to ruin their friendship, thinking it will give him peace and quiet. Thinking the bubbles are from each other, SpongeBob and Patrick become angry and get into a fight as Squidward comes outside and eats his souffl\u00e9, amused at his neighbors' fight. The two eventually declare that they are no longer friends before storming back to their houses (unaware of Squidward is the one who caused this).Squidward thinks the plan is working very well and goes to the next phase. Patrick gets squashed with his own house; while laughing and eating, Squidward starts to lure Patrick so he could be the bait to bring SpongeBob to him by pretending to get him to help as phase two of his plan. He begins to choke on the fork he was using, resulting him in fainting. Patrick witnesses this and successfully saves Squidward's life by performing CPR on him.Squidward thanks Patrick and he bribes him to help lure SpongeBob to his house by becoming Patrick's \"new friend\" (actually he is using him to lure SpongeBob as part of his plan), inviting him into his house to watch him practice his clarinet composition called \"Solitude in E Minor\" to lure him to sleep, which is hypnotizing him to help him lure SpongeBob as phase three of his plan. Despite Patrick claiming to love music, he immediately falls asleep as soon as Squidward plays a single note, which is the perfect opportunity to lure SpongeBob and make him his new friend. Meanwhile, a lonely SpongeBob tries to cheer himself up by drawing faces on three of his fingers and pretending they are his \"friends,\" but this only results in him bursting into tears.Squidward continues with his plan by attempting to drag the sleeping, heavy Patrick out of his house, and in the process, he throws his back out, which is phase four of his plan to make SpongeBob his friend. He uses his cries for help to lure SpongeBob, who sees this as an opportunity to help him and, despite protests from Squidward, he launches himself into the latter's back and cracks it back into place. Squidward screams but immediately feels better. He repeats his mistake, referring to SpongeBob as his \"friend\" while thanking him, thus making SpongeBob believe that Squidward is his new best friend.They both walk into Squidward's house and prepare to lure Patrick so Squidward could reveal that SpongeBob is now his friend as the fifth and final phase of his plan. Squidward asks SpongeBob to make noise for Patrick by playing a song badly for him on his cello (which he thinks is a bassinet).  Patrick wakes up while overhearing the song and appears in the window, only to interrupt the song, causing SpongeBob to destroy the instrument in a fit of rage. Squidward explodes in fury and kicks him out as a result, and decides to take a relaxing bubble bath, but is horrified to find Patrick, lounging in the tub and warming up a scrub brush and a bar of soap for him. Disgusted, Squidward furiously orders him to leave, but SpongeBob appears through the window and discovers Patrick in Squidward's tub, causing the two to argue again. This drives Squidward crazy with horror, and he flees his house to hide in a trash can outside. Seeing the huge terrible mess he created instead of getting the peace and quiet he thought he'd get, Squidward realizes he needs a plan to reunite SpongeBob and Patrick (and thus make them leave him alone).Squidward decides to invite SpongeBob and Patrick to a dinner party (without telling either of them that the other is coming) to fix their friendship. When they arrive, they are still mad at each other. Squidward tries to get them back together by offering them soda, but the situation devolves into a competition to see who can drink the most soda and thus become Squidward's friend. Eventually, Squidward runs out of soda and leaves to get some more, telling the two to stay and \"chat.\"While he is gone, SpongeBob and Patrick, who are both extremely engorged from all the soda they drank, still refuse to talk or even look at each other. SpongeBob then hiccups a small bubble that makes a burping sound upon popping, which amuses them both. Their immense laughter which follows releases bubbles, reverts them to their normal weight, and they become friends again. However, they create so many bubbles that it causes Squidward's house to explode. Upon arriving back and seeing the destruction, Squidward gets enraged and angrily tells the two to leave, and slams the door (which is somehow still standing) shut. Seconds later, a bubble pops against the door, causing it to fall over and crush Squidward, who then weakly moans over regaining pain in his back, concluding the episode.", "musics": ["Grass Skirts Blowing (Hilo March)", "Botany Bay (b)", "Nostalgic Hawaii", "Fates [#61.03]", "Death Trap [#25]", "Hawaiian Train", "Seaweed 1", "Closing Theme 1", "Maui Beach", "Wishful Thinking", "Squid Clarinet27", "Oyster Girls", "Shock (C)", "Hawaiian Link (B)", "Heroes Win [#35.03]", "On the Beach"]},

When he arrives, he throws his unicycle away under the assumption that he will definitely pass and no longer need it. Having taken the oral exam 37 times before, SpongeBob is able to answer most of the questions before Mrs. Puff even asks them. However, upon reaching the driving portion, SpongeBob gets nervous and quickly loses control of the boat, crashing into a lighthouse and causing Mrs. Puff's body to inflate.Later that night, SpongeBob complains about his failure to Gary, who asks him to go for a walk, which he declines. Patrick is then heard talking to him from a walkie-talkie under his covers. He asks SpongeBob to head to his library for a \"surprise,\" and SpongeBob finds Patrick wearing his clothes and calling himself \"Patrick SquarePants.\" SpongeBob is too depressed to laugh at this, and explains his problem to Patrick, mentioning that he needs someone to help him \"think straight\" during the driving test. Patrick quickly devises a plan. Using a cowboy hat to hide the antenna, he puts a walkie-talkie inside SpongeBob's head so he can offer advice.The next day, SpongeBob goes back to take the test again. When asked to start the boat, he initially panics, but Patrick's instructions keep him calm. Just after SpongeBob puts the boat in drive, he almost floors the pedal, but Patrick stops him just before his foot touches the pedal. Patrick then tells him to use his big toe on the pedal, and SpongeBob's toe pops out of his shoe to gently press the pedal. This is followed by a montage of SpongeBob acing the exam, interspersed with shots of Patrick eating SpongeBob's food, and reading his diary while helping him.Mrs. Puff is floored by SpongeBob's sudden improvement and jokingly suggests that his success is due to an antenna under his hat through which \"some guy miles away from here\" is giving him all the answers. SpongeBob (and Patrick) finds this hilarious until Mrs. Puff tells SpongeBob it would be cheating to do so. Upon realizing he has been cheating, SpongeBob goes into hysterics, followed by Patrick. Devastated and ashamed about what he has done, Patrick flees to his house, crying. SpongeBob starts driving wildly all over the course and sobbing, while Mrs. Puff, in a panic, tries desperately to stop him. SpongeBob is too distraught to listen and crashes the boat, failing the test and causing Mrs. Puff to inflate once again. As the episode ends with SpongeBob leaving boating school, he finds Gary riding his unicycle. SpongeBob rides off on it, with Gary atop his head, and happily rides off to visit the hospital, thus ending the episode from there.", "musics": ["Botany Bay (b)", "Aggressor", "Quiz Organ (B)", "Real Western Steel", "Hawaiian Cocktail", "Seaweed 3", "Hawaiian Adventures aka SpongeBob Theme", "Aloha O\u00e9", "Dangerous B", "Apalachian Banjo Duel", "Terminal Pursuit (C)", "Point of Departure K", "Menace from the Deep", "Rocket Sled to Oahu", "Dramatic Impact (6)", "Hawaiian Train", "Martial Links", "Side Drum [#52.07]", "Knuckleduster", "Cream Pie", "Aloha", "Hello Blues", "Sailor's Waltz"]},

SpongeBob explains his wish to Mr. Krabs, who laughs and says that SpongeBob would not last a day in the wild. Undeterred, SpongeBob quits his job and gives away all of his possessions to his friends. He even gives a tearful Patrick a large jar of mayonnaise, a stash of old phone books, and his prized jellyfish net, Ol' Reliable. Sandy is shocked to hear of SpongeBob's plans and tries to convince him otherwise, but SpongeBob declines and hopes that maybe one day they will end up like him. After saying goodbye to all his friends, SpongeBob removes his pants (except his shoes) and runs away naked while acting like a jellyfish, leaving Sandy and Squidward somewhat confused as to why he took off his pants. They leave after betting on his maximum time (Sandy gives him a week and Squidward gives him 11 minutes (clearly breaking the 4th Wall as each episode usually takes around said amount of time)) while Patrick starts to cry because he is devastated at the departure of his best friend.Once he arrives at Jellyfish Fields, SpongeBob is glad to be \"home\" and he tries to blend in with the other jellyfish. Patrick and Sandy have a picnic to try to trick SpongeBob into coming home, but SpongeBob resists, still insisting that he belongs with the jellyfish. A crazed and heartbroken Patrick soon returns with SpongeBob's jellyfish net, Ol' Reliable, having decided that if SpongeBob refuses to come home, then he'll force him to come back by capturing him and making him his trophy (even going as far as to make a trophy jar (possibly out of the same mayonnaise jar from before) meant for SpongeBob). SpongeBob frantically tries to dissuade Patrick into moving on as his former friend chases him through Jellyfish Fields.SpongeBob eventually jumps into a jellyfish hive out of Patrick's reach, finally forcing Patrick to give up. When the jellyfish return, they sting SpongeBob and chase him away. That night, SpongeBob tries to sleep in a cave, but feels very itchy. He finds poison sea urchins all over him, forcing him to run out of the cave scratching himself very fast.Finally realizing that the wilderness is not as good as he thought, SpongeBob tearfully returns to Bikini Bottom, muttering to himself that he gave up his life and friends for nothing. Upon reaching the pineapple, he is greeted with a \"Welcome Home\" party by his friends. All is forgiven, SpongeBob puts his clothes back on, and Mr. Krabs gives him his Krusty Krab employee hat back. Everyone then piles in Squidward (who is unhappy) for a group hug. However, the poison sea urchin bacteria spreads and everyone except SpongeBob becomes itchy.

However, Incidental 6 walks up to the door and attempts to make an order. Squidward smugly informs him that they are closed, and the customer prepares to take his money elsewhere. Realizing the financial potential of a late-night shift, Mr. Krabs tears apart the \"Closed\" sign and, against Squidward's wishes, proclaims the Krusty Krab to now be open 24 hours a day. Mr. Krabs then promptly leaves his employees while SpongeBob is overjoyed at this prospect and, as the night goes on, takes pleasure in the tasks he had no time to do during the day. When the time comes to take out the trash, however, he shows some trepidation towards the darkness outside. After going outside screaming to throw away the trash, he comes back in and calls it an easy task.Squidward, sensing SpongeBob's fear, weaves him a terrifying tale on the spot of a \"hash-slinging slasher,\" a clumsy Krusty Krab fry cook from years past who accidentally chopped off his hand and had it replaced with a rusty spatula. Due to fatally being run over by a bus and posthumous termination, the horrific specter returns every Tuesday night (though Squidward only put this detail in the story when SpongeBob told him that it was Tuesday) to exact vengeance on all who reside in the restaurant. Squidward goes on to explain the three signs of the ghost's return: the lights flickering on and off, the phone ringing with no one at the other end, and the arrival of the bus that had run the fry cook over. Squidward then laughs at SpongeBob's shrieks of fright, but when SpongeBob continues screaming, an annoyed Squidward tells SpongeBob that he was joking and that the story is not true.3:00 AM soon arrives and the restaurant is now completely devoid of customers or any other signs of life besides SpongeBob and Squidward. Whilst contending with SpongeBob's diligent ceiling washing, Squidward expresses bafflement at the idea of the Krusty Krab being open 24 hours a day, wondering who would want a Krabby Patty at that time. (Ironically, a cutaway gag shows Patrick excitedly waking up at this hour specifically to eat a Krabby Patty.)Suddenly, the lights begin flickering, though Squidward initially thinks SpongeBob is doing it in a failed attempt to scare him. After realizing that nobody is touching the light switch, Squidward then blames the faulty electrical wiring, as the restaurant was not built to run 24 hours a day. The next moment, the phone rings but remains silent when Squidward answers. This time, SpongeBob thinks that Squidward is trying to scare him, but the latter denies this and becomes more nervous as these are two of the three signs that supposedly signal the arrival of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. While trying to remember the third sign, a bus pulls up to the Krusty Krab, even though the buses supposedly do not run so late. Its lone departing passenger is a shadow-covered figure with what appears to be glowing red eyes, wielding a spatula. Fearing it to be the Hash-Slinging Slasher, Squidward screams in horror. SpongeBob states that he is dressed up as the ghost across the street to entertain him because he loves him. However, there are flaws in SpongeBob's theory that Squidward explained. The first thing is that he hates him, and the other thing is how is the ghost that is standing across the street is him when he is standing right next to him. Having thought about Squidward's argument, the Hash-Slinging Slasher taps on the door, which made SpongeBob scream in horror as well.Believing the events they witness to be supernatural, a frightened SpongeBob and Squidward say their final words as the figure approaches the counter. When the figure enters the light, however, he turns out to be just an ordinary person holding a spatula in a fully intact hand, which had been covered by his sleeve. He asks for a job application and reveals that he was the one who called earlier but hung up before speaking because he was nervous. Relieved, SpongeBob asks the applicant if he has any references, though Squidward notes that this turn of events does not explain the lights flickering.As if to answer his question, the lights flicker again, revealing the culprit to be none other than the vampire Nosferatu (portrayed by the late Max Schreck).

When SpongeBob strains to pick up a stick with two marshmallows on the sides, he accidentally rips his pants.This causes everyone to laugh, prompting SpongeBob to continue making ripped pants jokes.

The pair of pants suddenly takes on a personality and deserts SpongeBob as well. He sees some other people who make big mistakes.

A despondent Sandy walks off sadly, while SpongeBob tries to cheer her up and offers to play with her, but Sandy explains that she is just feeling a little homesick. SpongeBob and Patrick then blindfold her and take her to her treedome, which only adds to Sandy's depression. She begins crying, and runs off.Both SpongeBob and Patrick are confused until they hear Sandy singing a song from on top of her treedome about how much she misses Texas, which made everyone else suffer from her song and cry. They decide to cheer up Sandy by throwing a Texas-themed party for her at the Krusty Krab. They go to Sandy's house to ask her to come to the Krusty Krab with them, but she tells them that she is leaving Bikini Bottom to move back to Texas. SpongeBob is shocked by this, and tries to convince her to go to the Krusty Krab, but fails. Sandy gets into a bus out of Bikini Bottom and leaves. Patrick insults Texas by calling it dumb, asking what is so great about it.Suddenly, the bus comes back and Sandy returns, then angrily berates Patrick for badmouthing her hometown. Patrick then asks if he can say that people from Texas are dumb, which angers her even further. This gives SpongeBob an idea to lure Sandy to the Krusty Krab. He and Patrick continue insulting Texas, and an enraged Sandy begins chasing them. They intend to lead Sandy to her surprise party at the Krusty Krab. Patrick continuously insults Texas, thinking Sandy is too slow to catch up to them, only to soon realize that she is very fast and catching up to them.Sandy lassos Patrick and pulls him to her, and a nuclear explosion is shown in the background as he disappears. SpongeBob, still hoping to reach the Krusty Krab, begins screaming as he runs as fast as he can. Sandy's lasso reaches SpongeBob the instant he reaches the door of the Krusty Krab, and she attempts to pull him to her as he holds the door with his pinkie finger. Eventually, this causes the entire front of the building to be torn off, revealing the party inside.

The crowd is happy about this and starts cheering (with an exception of Squidward).

All the guests came except SpongeBob. SpongeBob got Patchy's invitation, but the lettering was smeared by the water. SpongeBob comments that the sender must not have understood the limitations of life underwater, then throws the invitation in the fire. Patchy introduces the viewers to his special guests, including King Neptune, Minnie Mermaid, and Long-Beard the Pirate.In Bikini Bottom, while shopping at the Barg'N-Mart, SpongeBob finds a \"Plan Your Own Party Kit,\" and decides to throw a party using the kit. Despite the kit advising to invite \"only your closest friends,\" SpongeBob invites nearly everyone in Bikini Bottom. Because a warning in the party kit states that unsupervised parties can lead to disaster, SpongeBob makes a brutally specific schedule for things to go to plan.Back in Patchy's party, Patchy decides to have a dance lesson and promotes his dance instruction videos, which Potty finds tacky. Before Patchy can teach his friends how to dance, a band Potty hired for the party arrives. It is Potty's favorite band, \"The Bird Brains.\" Everybody loves the Bird Brains' music, but Patchy hates it because it is too loud, and it blasts him out of his house. Patchy then tells them it is time for them to literally walk the plank. Unfortunately, he forgets that they are birds and can easily fly off.Back in Bikini Bottom, later that night, all the guests arrive at different times. SpongeBob is angered when the guests begin doing certain activities which don't occur until much later according to his schedule, and hands them all the topic cards, which causes an awkward environment. After the last guest arrives, SpongeBob goes into the closet.After a while, SpongeBob sees everybody having fun and starts to panic, as they are violating his completely unnecessary schedule, meaning in his words, the party will fail. He stops all the fun and music and brings them all to the couch to do one of the scheduled events, reading aloud from the funnies. Unfortunately, he finds out the paper he is reading is yesterday's paper and leaves to get today's paper. Once he leaves, all the guests start having fun again.While going out to get today's paper, SpongeBob accidentally locks himself out of his house as the door locks behind him when it closes, allowing the guests to have fun again. He misinterprets this and believes everything is falling apart.After continually trying to get into his house using different methods and failing quite horribly, SpongeBob, at wit's end, grabs a pickaxe and attempts to break in while dressed as a bunny. But before he could do so, the police find him and place him under arrest, but when SpongeBob explains everything, they do not arrest him, and SpongeBob is relieved he was almost ironically arrested for trying to break into his own house. However, the police end up making him miss the entire party by arresting him on purpose for not inviting them.He returns home the next morning depressed. He notices there was a key underneath the doormat the entire time. SpongeBob then enters his house, finding that it is a complete mess. He believes his party failed, until Patrick comes over and tells him that it was the greatest party all of them had ever been to, and that he should do exactly the same thing next weekend. SpongeBob finally realizes that he does not need a schedule to run a party and parties are supposed to be fun. He smiles gladly and becomes proud that his party was a success after all. He finds Gary wearing a lampshade and is happy that he had fun too. SpongeBob turns off Gary's lamp and wishes him a good night's sleep.Back in Patchy's party, Patchy attempts to perform his own song with a one-man-band and sings it off-key to the guests. Potty reminds him that it is time for Patchy's flute solo. Patchy starts playing, but soon realizes that he plays a fife, not a flute, and that the \"flute\" is actually a stick of dynamite (it was notably Potty's plan so he would let Patchy perform but find a way to kill him). It explodes, leaving only his head intact. The Bird Brains then have the opportunity to play music, singing their new song, \"Underwater Sun.\" After they finish, Patchy returns to say bye to the viewers, with a barrel for a new body, before being kissed by girl parrots.

Squidward keeps walking to work while SpongeBob visits Sandy. He finds Sandy with a machine that can transport things. Sandy shows SpongeBob how it works by teleporting an apple to Mrs. Puff's desk. SpongeBob asks Sandy if it can transport him to the Krusty Krab. She allows him to try it. When he gets there, part of Squidward's arm gets stuck in him. Suddenly, the machine's remote control goes haywire and burns out and SpongeBob and Squidward are transported back, fusing them.Sandy sees what has happened and is terrified. When they walk out, SpongeBob has his normal head/body, while Squidward's head is sticking out of the upper left. They are also in control of each other's arms; SpongeBob is controlling Squidward's hand, while Squidward is controlling SpongeBob's. Squidward tries to get out, but he cannot. He is scared of the fact he and SpongeBob are stuck together. SpongeBob says they can be together forever now, scaring him more. Squidward asks Sandy to do something. She decides to zap them back in the transporter. She zaps them to a school, a hospital, and an unnamed planet, but they are still stuck together. Squidward says she has to get them unstuck. Sandy tells Squidward she was working on a new invention, but it is not ready. He tells her to hurry because he cannot stay stuck to SpongeBob.She tells him to stay calm, and she will continue working on it. Squidward and SpongeBob are riding to work on a bike. SpongeBob says he will drive, but Squidward keeps getting hit by the wheel. They crash into the kitchen, and Mr. Krabs asks what happened. They stand up, revealing their morphed body. Mr. Krabs just tells them to get to work. They try working, but they cannot because they are stuck together. Mr. Krabs kicks them out and tells them not to come back until they fix their problem. SpongeBob says they still have each other, and Squidward angrily says that is how they ended up like this in the first place. Squidward practices playing clarinet while SpongeBob is sad. A surfer guy passes and says \"Rock on, Freaky Bro.\" They run over to Sandy's and ask her if she has found a way to fix them. Sandy says she has invented the Molecular Separator Ray. Squidward is ready to be free, but Sandy says the invention is not complete . She says she will probably have it ready the day after tomorrow.

SpongeBob and Squidward try to go to their own houses, but they cannot due to being stuck.Squidward tries by force, but it pushes their houses together. At the clarinet performance the next day, Squidward is wondering where Sandy is. He thinks about giving up, but SpongeBob tells him this is his big chance to be a star. Squidward decides to wear a cloak to hide SpongeBob. He starts playing his clarinet, upsetting everyone. A loose nail pulls the cloak off, revealing their secret. Amazingly, the crowd loves this sight and starts cheering. Excited, Squidward basks at the moment as he finally knows what it feels like to be a star. Suddenly, Sandy shows up and tells Squidward she finished the device. Squidward tries to tell her not to, but she separates the two, displeasing the crowd. Squidward starts playing his clarinet again, but everyone hates the sound of it.The crowd leaves in anger and disgust, except Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Pearl, Larry, and Mrs. Puff, as Squidward says his one moment of fame is gone.

Just then, Mr. Krabs excitedly announces that this particular dollar is his one millionth earned. After congratulating and thanking SpongeBob and Squidward, he says they are going on a surprise trip to celebrate. Squidward guesses they will be going to special places, such as Fancy Springs, Pamper Island, or Bikini Bottom Folk Village. To Squidward's dismay, however, they go clam fishing in a boat called the S.S. Cheapskate on a smelly brine lagoon.While fishing, SpongeBob accidentally hooks the back of Mr. Krabs' pants, which he has taped his millionth dollar to, and rips it off. Once the dollar is thrown into the lagoon, dramatic music played by a live-action orchestra starts up, giving SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs a dark warning that a giant clam is close by. As Mr. Krabs pleads for the orchestra to stop playing to no avail, SpongeBob frantically reels the dollar back into the boat, and for a few seconds, Mr. Krabs is happy at the dollar's safety. Next second, however, a giant blue-lipped clam suddenly jumps out of the lagoon, grabs the dollar from Mr. Krabs' claws, and swims away. Mr. Krabs starts sobbing and, after informing Squidward of what just happened, he falls into an uncontrollable crying fit, which an annoyed Squidward tries unsuccessfully to snap him out of. Finally, Squidward reluctantly promises to help Mr. Krabs get his dollar back. He is happy to hear this, and gives everyone supplies so that they can prepare themselves for catching the clam. Mr. Krabs then starts keeping a lookout for the clam.After three days, the clam still has not returned. SpongeBob and Squidward have grown tired of waiting, so they try to fool Mr. Krabs by giving him an ordinary dollar out of Squidward's wallet, which was all crumpled up, torn slightly, soaked in the lagoon, and kissed up with Coral Blue #3 Semi-Gloss Lipstick that SpongeBob used it. Mr. Krabs sees through their scheme and states that he will give a sandwich to whoever retrieves his dollar. He goes so far as to toss the other sandwiches and the entire fridge into the lagoon, making the sandwich the only piece of food on board. Squidward and SpongeBob realize that their boss has succumbed to madness and try to escape, only for Mr. Krabs to catch them and use them as bait for the clam.Soon, the dramatic music starts again, with Mr. Krabs being the conductor. The clam advances toward the boat with Mr. Krabs' dollar lying on his tongue. Mr. Krabs jumps onto the clam's tongue and grabs the dollar, only for the clam to shut its mouth and dive back into the lagoon.
