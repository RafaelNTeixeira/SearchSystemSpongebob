Suddenly, Gary falls in love with a snail named Mary. Meanwhile, SpongeBob sleeps in the waiting chair. Then, another snail who is the boyfriend of Mary, gets jealous at Gary and threatens to stay away from her, but Mary hates him and falls in love with Gary anyway, which angers the other snail even further as he seeks revenge. Then, SpongeBob comes and tells Gary they are leaving, along with Mary's owner.At nighttime in SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob feeds Gary seaweed noodle stew for dinner and they go to bed afterwards. The next day, Gary sneaks out of the house to find Mary. SpongeBob awakens to find a picture of Mary under the plate Gary ate on, which he thinks is Gary leading him to think that it is a ransom note from a snailnapper, so he sets out to ""save"" Gary.Meanwhile, Gary stays onto a sidewalk with dozens of snail owners having a stroll. Then he sees Mary's owner going into a pet store and goes in himself. The clerk thinks he is a stray and puts him on sale. A few seconds later, the snail from earlier and his friends ransack the store so that the clerk can tell him where Gary is. During the ransack, Gary escapes. The other snails see what appears to be Gary, only to find out it is a vicious poodle worm.Gary then sees Mary but sees her in a boatmobile and jumps on top of other boats in order to find her. He succeeds, but SpongeBob finally finds him, along with the other snail. Then, a man from a soap opera Gary was watching in the beginning finds Mary's owner, who turns out to be his lost love. Beside him is a handsome snail whom Mary gets together with, with SpongeBob remarking over how heartbroken Gary is.The other snail forgives Gary and becomes friends with him by asking Gary if he wants to go get seaweed noodle stew with him. SpongeBob ends the episode by noting how fast snails grow up.",Gary in Love,"[Episode starts with Gary watching TV]
Monica: Help! Help!
Pirate: [laughs heartily when a heart-shaped box of chocolates is thrown at him] Doh! Right in me crow's nest! [then groans and faints]
Monica: [gasps]
Brad: Monica!
Monica: Brad! [she and Brad run up to each other and hug]
Brad: Oh, Monica, I've thought I might never find you. [Gary's eyes brim with tears] I promise to never leave you at your side.
Monica: Oh, Brad.
Brad: Oh, Monica. [Gary is about to cry when SpongeBob turns off the TV]
SpongeBob: Do you know what today is, little guy?
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: It's take Gary for a walk in a park day!
Gary: [uninterested] Meow.
[Gary is about to slither away when SpongeBob leashes him and takes him for a walk. Scene cuts to the Snail Park where all the other snails live. SpongeBob and Gary walk in.]
SpongeBob: Isn't this great, Gary? A whole park full of your own species. [Gary sees all the other snails are bored] Go ahead, have a good time. [sees the two owners sleeping on a bench and SpongeBob walks and sits down between them] I'll just sit down for a sec. [falls asleep with the two owners. Gary sees the two other snails on the swing feeling bored then he sees one snail about to climb up the ladder where the slide is next to and falls down bored, and Gary sees the seesaw where a little snail named 'Mary' is on. Gary's eyes turn into hearts and slither to the other side of the seesaw. Mary sees Gary who is falling in love with her.]
Gary: [to Mary] Meoooow.
Mary: [to Gary] Meooow. [Gary and Mary are sea sawing up and down. Suddenly someone flips Gary on the seasaw in mid-air]
Gary: MREOOOW REOOOOW REOOOW REOOOW! OOF! [a snail slithers up to Gary]
Snail Boss: Hey, lightweight! What do you think you're doing with my girl? [to Mary] Come on, Mary, let's go.
Mary: Mreoooow. [slithers next to Gary who smiles at her]
Snail Boss: [to Gary] You've just made a big mistake, pal.
Gary: Grrrrr... [both growl at each other when SpongeBob picks Gary up]
SpongeBob: Say goodbye to your friends, Gary! Play time's over! I've gotta fix us some dinner! [walks off with Gary in his hands]
Gary: [to Mary] Meoooow.
Mary: [to Gary] Meoooow. [Mabel walks up and picks up Mary]
Mabel/Monica: Let's go, Mary. [walks off]
Snail Boss: Hey, this ain't over, runt! When I get through with yous, the doctor won't know which side to sow your lips back on... to! [two of the other angry snails slither up to their leader of the snail gang] That little runt is going to get what's coming to him! [scene cuts to SpongeBob making seaweed noodle stew in the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Mmm-mmm! Seaweed noodle stew. [scene scrolls over to Gary drawing a picture of Mary. It depicts a snail looking like Gary with lipstick]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [sets the seaweed noodle stew on the drawing of Mary] Bon appetit, Gary. I made it with extra love. [Gary sees the seaweed noodle stew, which turns into a sculpture of Mary. Gary kisses the seaweed noodle stew] Not exactly what I had in mind, but, eh... knock yourself out. [walks off to his room getting ready for bed. Gary keeps on kissing the seaweed noodle stew and stops]
Gary: [sighs sadly and meows, scene cuts to SpongeBob doing touching his toes]
SpongeBob: One, two. One, two. One, two. [Gary slithers in SpongeBob's room looking sad] One, two. One, two. One, two. One-oh. There you are. That sure was a knockout dinner, eh?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Come on, Gary, it's time for beddy-bye! [sets Gary on the newspapers which are beds, then to Gary] Night-night, Gare-Bear.
[SpongeBob turns off the lights and he and Gary fall asleep. Inside of Gary's head, he dreams about him and Mary playing on a see-saw. Mary slithers toward Gary and they both kiss with their lips when the dream ends. Gary wakes up from his dream. Gary carefully slithers out of SpongeBob's house to go find Mary. The next morning, the foghorn alarm goes off and SpongeBob wakes up with a smile, he yawns]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Gary! [notices that Gary is not there] Hmm? Where is he? Oh, he's probably using his snail box. That was a pretty noodly stew he ate last night. [goes over to the guest room where the litter box is] Peek-a-boo! [notices that Gary is not there either] Huh? Not in here either. [goes down the stairs into the kitchen] Gary? Where are you? [notices an empty plate of seaweed noodle stew] Gah! I am gonna teach that snail how to clean up after himself. [picks up the plate and notices a picture of Mary that Gary drew] What's this? Some sort of ransom note? [examines Gary's drawing] Holy Neptune! My Gary has been petnapped by a deranged snail-lover! [goes outside to save Gary] Don't worry, Gare-Bear, I'll save you! [scene cuts to Gary slithering toward the Snail Park where all the other snails are. He looks in a pipe]
Gary: Meow? [sees a silhouette of a girl snail on a slide and rushes to meet her, but it is a different snail]
Elderly snail: [low voice] Meeooooooooow...
Gary: Meow reow. [slithers away. The snails #1, 2, and 3 arrive at a hole in the gate]
Snail Boss: After me, fellas. [they slither into the Snail Park underneath the gate hole]
Bully snail: [struggles to get through the gate hole since the spikes on top of his shell are getting in the way] Hey, how come we never go through the front, guys?
Snail Boss: 'Cause the bad guys don't never use the front door!
Bully snail: [gets through the gate hole] Well, I think that that's pretty ridiculous. [they slither toward the other snails who are playing and doing stunts]
Snail Boss: [to all the other snails] All right. Listen up! Any of you seen a snail come through here? About a... yay tall, a shell, couple of eyes? [all the other snails don't understand]
Bully snail: I think you need to be more descriptive.
Snail Boss: Oh, okay, let's see here. Uh, this particular snail thinks it's real funny to make goo-goo eyes on my girl. [all the other snails laugh and continue playing and doing stunts] Hey! What you's giggling at! They's giggling at me! Alright, that's it! You's all going on my list! You's got that? You're on the list! [they slither off through the gate hole, but the snail with spikes is stuck again and can't get through. He then struggles and sighs. Scene cuts to SpongeBob looking for Gary]
SpongeBob: Gary? Gary? Where are you, buddy? [stops and slides on some trail of snail slime that he sees and gasps] Snail slime! Looks like it could be Gary's. [touches the snail smile with his finger] Colors right. Consistency matches. Now for the true test. [licks it] Uh-huh. It is Gary's slime. I'm on the trail, Gary! [follows Gary's snail slime. Scene cuts to Gary slithering on the sidewalk looking for Mary and her owner. He slithers through dozens of snails with their owners. They all stop and look both ways and a dozen of worms and their owners walk by. Gary continues slithering on and sees Mary with her owner. He slithers toward her while all the other snail and worm owners go across the street. Gary sees Mary and her owner walking in towards the pet store and follows inside when he bumps into the pet store owner ""Harold""]
Harold: [picks up Gary] Why, hello there, little fellow. Are you a stray? [sets Gary in a cage] There now. Isn't that better?
Gary: [to Harold, sadly] Meow reow. [sees Mary leaving outside the pet store with Mabel. A few seconds later, the three angry snail gang members slither inside the pet store and Gary hides in his shell. The three snail gang members slither towards Harold and asks where Gary is]
Snail Boss: Meow meow meow meow?
Harold: No. No, I haven't seen any stray snails come in here.
Snail Boss: [to the other two angry snails] He's trying to pull a fast one, fellas. [smiles evily] Why don't we give him a taste of our special brand of swift justice?!
French Narrator: Two hours later... [the pet store is shown to be all broken and torn inside from the three angry snail gang members who wrecked it. Harold sits there, scared]
Snail Boss: Heh! That's enough, boys. I've think we've done a thorough job.
Bully snail: Yeah. Let's get back to finding that snail. [whacks the cash register next to Harold. An orange snail with a red cap on sees the sale cage which is not broken]
Dan (Bully snail 2): Hey, Boss, there's one left.
Snail Boss: Oh, yeah? [slithers towards the cage with a bat] I know you're in there, you little runt! [breaks the sale cage with the bat, revealing a large green vicious worm]
Vicious Worm: [barks loudly]
Snail Boss: YAAAAH! [the worm attacks him]
Dan (Bully snail 2) and Bully snail: HAAAAH! [run for their lives out of the store]
Snail Boss: AHH! MOMMY! MOMMY! [Gary escapes and Harold spots him]
Harold: You! [Gary keeps running] Come back here! You're gonna help me clean this place up! [Gary slithers out of the broken pet store, then Harold talks to himself] You brought this on yourself, Harold. I did not, Harold. Yes, you did, Harold. Harold, I did not. [Gary slithers quickly across the street when a car pulls up. It is revealed to be Mabel and Mary inside the car and Mabel honks the horn]
Mabel/Monica: Come on, move it! [Gary sees Mary and his eyes google and hearts floats around] Get out of the road! [drives around Gary and drives away. Gary is about to go after her when the two angry snail gang members show up and grab Gary's tail]
Bully snail: Where do you think you're going? [Gary sees and hears Mary meowing for help. Dan and the bully snail try to grab Gary]
Bully snail: Get' em!
Dan (Bully snail 2) and Bully snail: [Gary jumps out of the way which causes them to hit each other and their eyestalks get tangled. They try to get free when they see Gary come up galloping and jumping into them. Their eyestalks become tangled and Gary catapults himself into the air. Gary is flying in mid-air then he notices that he cannot fly. Gary falls into the car and lands on the driver's head, which the driver screams and drives crazy. Gary jumps into Mabel's car and lands safely into the back of the car seat and slithers towards Mary]
Gary: [to Mary] Meoooow.
Mary: [to Gary] Meooow. [SpongeBob finally stops and sees Gary and Mary inside Mabel's car]
SpongeBob: Gary? Gary?! [Gary and Mary meow at each other happily when Mable sees Gary in her car and gasps]
Mable/Monica: What the? [parks the car and SpongeBob crashes into the motor] What do you think you're doing in my car? No free rides, loafer! [picks up Gary when SpongeBob finally finds them]
SpongeBob: [to Mabel] Hold it right there! Hands off my Gary, you snailnapper!
Mabel/Monica: Snailnapper? [gets out of the car and puts down Gary] I don't want your dumb ol' snail.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. I suppose he wandered out of the house in the middle of the night just so he can jump into your car.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Not now, Gary, I'm scolding. And I suppose... Wh-wha-what?
Gary: Meow meow meow meow. Meow.
SpongeBob: You did wander out of the house on your own? But why? [Mary comes slithering next to Gary and SpongeBob sees Gary and Mary purring at each other happily] Oh, I see why. Good ol' fashioned amore! [Just then, the Boss snail catches up to Gary]
Snail Boss: Hey! This ain't over yet, runt! [The two snails start growling at each other when Brad shows up from the TV show that Gary was watching.]
Brad: Monica? Monica!
Mable/Monica: [gasps] Brad! [The two run to each other and hug]
Brad: Oh, Monica, I've thought I've never find you, Monica. I was just taking Billy here for a walk. [A handsome snail named ""Billy"" appears next to Brad. Mary turns around and slithers towards Billy]
Mary: [to Billy] Meoooow.
Billy: [to Mary] Meow. [the two snails keep growling at each other and stop to see that Mary and Billy are together and in love]
Snail Boss: Huh?
Gary: Meow?
Brad: I promise to never again leave your side. Let's go get a steaming hot cup of joe. [the two start to walk off with their snails]
Mabel/Monica: Oh, Brad.
Brad: Oh, Monica.
SpongeBob: That's gotta hurt, buddy.
Gary: Meow reow.
Snail Boss: [smiles to Gary] Eh. Come on, runt, I'll show you this great dumpster where we can get some seaweed noodle stew!
Gary: [smiles] Meow! [he and the Snail Boss slither off toward the dumpster]
SpongeBob: Don't stay out too late, Gary! [sighs happily] They grow up so fast.",5.52,"Casey Alexander,Zeus Cervas,Derek Iversen"

They hold a slide carousel, mentioning they confiscated it. SpongeBob and Patrick ask Sandy what is going on, and she says she has a copy of the slide carousel to show them. The show begins.In the show, SpongeBob meets Sandy, who is preparing for a trip to the moon. She asks him to help her with her luggage, but he runs off to the bakery. He tries to take a number, but gets tangled in the tickets from the dispenser, to the baker's annoyance. The baker asks for ""Number 12,"" and SpongeBob gives him his ticket. Through gritted teeth, the irritated baker asks him what he would like. SpongeBob says he would like a bon voyage sheet cake with ""yummy letters."" He asks the baker to write, ""Have fun on the moon,"" but thinks of what would rhyme with moon (goon, rune, noon, tune), while the baker angrily suggests loon, but he goes with ""See you soon."" He takes the cake to Sandy's, but her rocket just started the countdown. It lifts its ladder, but SpongeBob leaps on, and into the ship. Sandy is annoyed, and says she must adjust for the newly added weight of SpongeBob. The ship blasts off, and soon they are in space. While in there, SpongeBob presents her with the cake. She warns him that food that is not contained will fall apart in a zero-gravity environment, which the cake promptly does. She says everything will be fine unless it gets into the vent, and once again, the cake does just that. She climbs into a special suit and goes out to remove the cake from the vents. While standing out there, she takes a bit of the cake and says it could use ""more nuts."" She returns to the ship, and the moon is getting closer. Sandy picks a crater as a good place to land the ship.When they exit the ship, Sandy sandboards on the moon, showing off many of her moves, such as the ""Flippity-Doo Dah,"" the classic Texas tail grab (where Sandy grabs her tail to the shape of Texas with a star on it), and the 7-20 nut-job (where she slices a moon rock to an acorn, and eats it), including one where she lies on Saturn's rings; the ""Tour de Saturn.""When it is SpongeBob's turn to sandboard, he floats away, since he is too light in the moon's gravity. Sandy uses a lasso made with a rope and a moon rock, and tells SpongeBob to grab it. He does, and falls to the moon. While screaming and holding onto the moon rock, he shows amazing skills, which impresses Sandy. SpongeBob tries again, but this time, his board crashes into the fuel tank, causing it to leak. Sandy pulls SpongeBob back to the ship, telling him they need to return home while there is still enough fuel left. They manage to make it back to Earth, but the steep dive means they will turn into a giant fireball, which causes SpongeBob to panic. Sandy goes outside to ""grab this bull by the horns"" and lassos the ship, pulling it out of its dive. It flies over Bikini Bottom, doing loop-de-loops, and eventually crashing to the ground. SpongeBob sees an unconscious Sandy lying on the ground and tearfully apologizes for ruining her vacation. Sandy tells him he did not ruin her vacation; she had a great time. She plans on taking him with her to Mars next, then jokingly suggests he bring her cakes more often, and they laugh, as the episode ends.",Mooncation,"Patrick: [walking] So why are we going to Sandy's house?
SpongeBob: To see her vacation slides for the hu.. [gets smacked in face by door] Ow!
ZDS Agent: [walking out the door with his partner and the slides] We got the slides, sir.
Patrick: Who?...What?...Why?
[SpongeBob and Patrick get dragged in by Sandy.]
Sandy: [taking SpongeBob and Patrick] Those two agents from the Zero Dryland Security just confiscated all my vacation slides, boys. Or so they think... [pulls a tree trunk lever to activate a secret hideout] You see, [puts the two on two chairs. She goes to a copy of the vacation slides] Someone already made six copies.
[SpongeBob raises his hand.]
Sandy: Yes, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Who is this someone? Do we know him?
Sandy: By someone, I was implying me, SpongeBob. [Patrick raises his hand] Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: Can you not imply anymore? It's confusing.
[SpongeBob raises his hand again.]
Sandy: [tying up SpongeBob and Patrick with rope] Okay, no more questions until the end of the slideshow. Okay? [they nod in agreement] Good. [shows the first slide] The first slide is of me getting some last-minute readings before I took off on my vacation. [switches to the next slide] And this is me giving the thumbs-up-goodbye for now salute. [shows the next slide] And this... [dreadfully] This is where a little square pal of mine decided to pay me a visit.
[Transition to SpongeBob visiting Sandy.]
SpongeBob: [walking to Sandy's house] ♪I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy [spinning] I'm ready to ring Sandy's doorbell♪ [rings the doorbell; suddenly, an extreme humming noise vibrates the ocean floor] Sandy...! [a rocket emerges from beneath the ground] Whoa!
Sandy: What do you think of my moon wagon?
SpongeBob: Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I activated it! How was I to know it was hooked up to your doorbell?
Sandy: Oh no, SpongeBob. That's what you call a ""coincidence."" I'm getting ready for my vacation!
SpongeBob: Where are you going?
Sandy: The moon! [SpongeBob gasps]
SpongeBob: You're going on a moon trip?!
Sandy: Yep! I'm all packed up and ready to go. Wanna help me…
SpongeBob: I'll be right back!
Sandy: ...load up the moon wagon? [sighs]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is at bakery] Morning, Mr. Bakerman! Oh, that's right, I'm sorry. I have to pick a number. [attempts to pull a ticket, but fails and gets tangled up]
Bakerman: Number 12.
SpongeBob: Yes, I'm Number 12!
Bakerman: What can I get for you today?
SpongeBob: I need a bon voyage sheet cake. [Bakerman brings out out sheet cake] Could you put yummy words on it? Hmmmmm, what would those yummy words be? I got it! ""Have fun on the moon..."" What rhymes with ""moon""? Tune? Roon? Noon? Goon?
Bakerman: How about “loon?”
SpongeBob: I got it! ""See you soon!”
Countdown: [SpongeBob heads back to Sandy’s dome with the cake. The rocket is a few seconds from takeoff] T-minus 12, 11, 10, 9, 8…
SpongeBob: No, Sandy! Wait! You can't go without your sheet cake! [grabs a hold of the ladder, but falls into the rocket] Whoa!
Sandy: [sees SpongeBob] SpongeBob? What in cold chicken and pickles are you doing in my ship?
SpongeBob: [panting, and out of breath] I went to get you a, so I went to the, and then I got you a, and then T-minus something, and…
Countdown: Launch commencing.
Sandy: Never mind. Can't stop the countdown now. Better strap yourself down. Looks like you're going on a mooncation!
SpongeBob: I am?! Whoooooo! Moon trip! Moon trip! Moon trip! [rocket takes off] Hey, Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Hey, Sandy...
Sandy: Uh, I'm kinda busy here, SpongeBob. Gotta recalculate to account for the extra weight.
SpongeBob: Oh, I just wanted to show you the…
Sandy: for the afterburners! [activates afterburners; propels rocket further] What were you saying, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, I… brought you a “bon voyage” sheet cake.
Sandy: You can't bring regular food into space!
SpongeBob: Wha, wha, wha, why not?
Sandy: Because, as we leave Earth's gravity, everything becomes weightless, and any un-contained food will float off in all directions!
SpongeBob: Oh. Is that a bad thing?
Sandy: Only if it gets sucked into the reverse spatial linearity drive. [cake floats into the reverse spatial linearity drive. The rocket engine malfunctions and turns off] Ah nuts!
SpongeBob: Oops. Sorry, Sandy.
Sandy: [presses ""Toss"" button, and gets dressed in a large space suit] Well, it's a good thing I've brought my special space suit designed for just this kind of situation! Now, try not to file anything else up while I'm saving our necks. [goes into space] Aha! There's our problem. [clears the cake out from the the reverse spatial linearity drive.] Eh, could've used more nuts. [comes back inside rocket] Okay. I've got her up and running, again. Now, can you please sit with your hands folded for a while, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Roger that! Folding hands.
Sandy: Now, get ready for lunar module se…
SpongeBob: [folds hands into a bird] What do you think Sandy?
Sandy: Just don't touch anything while we separate.
SpongeBob: Ok.
Sandy: [detaches rocket from boosters] That looks like a good spot. [lands on the moon, sets camp up] Alright, SpongeBob. Now that our camp is set up, it's time for some moon crater boarding! [brings out boards]
SpongeBob: What's moon crater boarding?
Sandy: You ride these on that like this. [jumps on and rides her snowboard on the moon] Yeehaw! Right here is the Flip-a-dee-do-dah. [flips her board in midair] Right there is the classic Texas tail grab. [grabs tail, and twists it into the shape of Texas] And this I call the 7-20 Nut Drop. [spins and breaks an asteroid into an acorn and eats it] Munchie! And let's not forget my grandpappy's favorite: The Tour de Saturn. [lies down on Saturn's rings] Star gazer! Yeehaw! Nothing like extreme sports and zero gravity! Alright your turn.
SpongeBob: Oh gee Sandy. I don't know. This looks kinda scary.
Sandy: Oh, come on SpongeBob. You got this! It's a can of corn.
SpongeBob: I don't know what corn is, but I sure like cans. Alright, I'll give it a try. [jumps on board and floats off into space] Sandy, this doesn't seem right.
Sandy: Uh oh! Looks like SpongeBob's too light for lunar gravity. SpongeBob, grab a hold of this! [lassos asteroid to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [grabs onto asteroid] Ok. [the rock pulls SpongeBob to the moon surface. SpongeBob begins to surf the moon, but screams]
Sandy: Wow, SpongeBob! What do you call that trick? [SpongeBob keeps screaming] Interesting. Maybe you can teach me how to do a “Waaaaah!”
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob continues screaming, and begins to surf over a satellite] Hey, this is kind of fun! [leaps, and bounces off the satellite, damaging it]
Frankie Billy: [shifts to Patrick watching TV] Carol, your real father is… [TV goes out due to satellite damage]
Patrick: Hey! Who's Carol's real father?!
SpongeBob: [scene returns to SpongeBob] Watch this Sandy! [ties an asteroid to his helmet to hold him down] Alright. A no-look... let's see... a one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up… [accidentally smashes into rocket's fuel tank, making it leak] puncture into the side of the rocket.
Sandy: You did great, SpongeBob! But, you should call your trick the ""no-look, one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up, puncture the fuel tank on the rocket.”
SpongeBob: Oops!
Sandy: Come on, SpongeBob. We gotta get while there's still enough fuel to make it home!
SpongeBob: Wait! I have to do something very important! [takes picture of himself “holding the earth”] There! [both go into the rocket, and head for earth] So, we are going to make it, aren’t we Sandy?
Sandy: If the fuel holds out, there's no reason to panic. [rocket fuel signs shows ""Empty."" Rocket starts falling to earth] Without the engines, we've lost all control. We're coming in too steep!
SpongeBob: Is that bad?
Sandy: [unbuckles seatbelt] Only if you consider being consumed in a giant fireball ""bad.""
SpongeBob: Well, in that case, I won’t… giant fireball?! [unbuckles seatbelt, but hits wall] Sandy, where are you going?
Sandy: I'm going to take this bull by the horns! [Lassos the nose of the rocket. Rocket begins to catch fire as it descends towards earth]
SpongeBob: Are we gonna get consumed in a giant fireball?
Sandy: Not if I can keep her nose up we aren't. Hang on! It's gonna get bumpy when we hit the atmosphere. [the rocket keeps falling at a faster rate. SpongeBob yells in terror] Yeehaw!
SpongeBob: [continues screaming] My goodness!
Sandy: Yeehaw! Yeehaw! [rockets crashes]
SpongeBob: Oh, oh my gosh! Sandy! Sandy, are you okay? [Sandy groans] Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I ruined your vacation.
Sandy: Ruined? Oh heck no! That was the most fun I've had in a toad's age! Once I get my rocket fixed, you and me is heading to Mars. Now, let's go grab another one of them sheet cakes.

Patrick then starts playing with a snow globe until a big coral monster hovers above him. Patrick hands the snow globe to the monster, showing him how to work it. The monster seems to have just as much fun as Patrick did with it. Then, Patrick and the monster smell each other's armpits, just to pass the time, and then they play a short game of hide and seek.After playing a few rounds of coral ring toss, Patrick jumps in the monster's mouth and rides over to SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob sees Patrick in the monster's mouth and thinks he is being eaten by him. He then has a flashback to a problem ""just as bad"" the day before, when the soda machine at the Krusty Krab ran out of ice. Patrick then introduces the monster to SpongeBob, who finds out the monster's name is Rrarrg. Patrick says Rrarrg can live under his rock, but Rrarrg tries it and smashes Patrick's house. Patrick and SpongeBob then accidentally encourage him to go and smash SpongeBob's house. Gary escapes the house right before it is destroyed.He then smashes Squidward's house and is put under captivity by the police. When a cop sneezes in the megaphone, Rrarrg goes berserk. He then goes through Bikini Bottom and the police finally catch him and the chief angrily threatens to sneeze in the megaphone and make him to berserk again if he takes one more step before he gets captured. After Patrick tries, but fails to save him, they drive him out of town. However, SpongeBob has an idea. They transport Rrarrg and Patrick to a snowy mountain to get ice for the customers at the Krusty Krab. Whenever a customer needs ice, SpongeBob just calls Patrick for Rrarrg to smash a big block of it and to throw the cubes to the Krusty Krab when the ice machine is broken. The customer thanks SpongeBob for the ice and SpongeBob asks him to thank Rrarrg, leaving the customer in confusion, as the episode ends.",The Monster Who Came to Bikini Bottom,"[Patrick is tip-toeing around and laughing. Falls off a barrel]
Patrick: Look, another rubber stopper for my rubber stopper collection. [pulls out the stopper. Toxic waste spills out. Cut to Patrick holding a snow globe] It's a little land that's all mine! [turns it upside-down and back up] Now it's snowing in my little land! [shakes it] It's snowing again! [puts the snow globe down and claps. The ground shakes. A monster drools on Patrick] Hey, my little land must be having an earthquake. [a purple monster is standing over Patrick. It growls] Must have been an aftershock. [monster grabs the snow globe and roars] Uh, hey! No wonder you're angry. You just gotta turn it upside down. See? [the monster turns it upside-down and back up. He laughs and so does Patrick]
French Narrator: Much, much later... [Patrick and the monster are still laughing]
Patrick: Snow globes are always funny. [sniffs his armpit] Hey, you want to smell my armpit? There you go.
[Monster sniffs Patrick's armpit. Patrick laughs. The monster pokes Patrick and has him smell his armpit]
Patrick: Thanks. Oh, hey, do you like to play tag? [monster growls] Never played it before, huh? Uh, yeah, it's kinda hard to explain. Oh, how about hide-and-seek? [monster growls] No, no, no, this one's easy. You just close your eyes while the other guy hides, and then you find him and you win. Okay? Ready, uh, now go hide. [covers eyes] 1, 2, 3. You can skip a few, 100. Okay, ready or not, here I come! [monster is not there] Hey... Where'd you go? Why are you hiding from me? [sobs] This game's harder than I thought! [monster touches Patrick on the shoulder and growls] You want to smell my armpit again? [cut to them playing ring toss] You win again! Hey, hey! You want to go meet my friend, SpongeBob? Oh, he's a little weird, but you guys will probably get along. [the monster grabs Patrick and puts him in his mouth] We can play more coral ring toss later.
SpongeBob: [putting food in Gary's bowl] Dinnertime, Gary! And it's your favorite flavor—crushed anemone byproducts and krill. [ground shakes] What is that horrific banging? [looks out the window and sees Patrick inside the monster's mouth] Patrick's being eaten by a giant sea monster!
Patrick: Hey, hey!
SpongeBob: Oh, he's crying out for help!
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! Hey, up here! Look, no hands! [chuckles]
SpongeBob: Gary, this is even worse than yesterday!
French Narrator: Yesterday... [at Krusty Krab, a customer is trying to get some ice in his cup but there is no ice coming out]
Nat: Excuse me, I think your ice machine's broken.
Squidward: Keep looking. You'll find someone who cares.
Nat: Uh, you're the owner here, aren't you?
Mr. Krabs: That would be me. [chuckles]
Nat: Well, I think your ice machine might be broken.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, try telling that guy over there. [points to SpongeBob, who is cleaning tables]
Nat: Excuse me, the ice machine's broken.
SpongeBob: Noooo! Why?! Why?! Why?! [sobbing] Why?! [flashback ends] It was horrible. [knock on door. SpongeBob opens it to see Patrick] Patrick! Patrick! [gives him a hug]
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I must've been daydreaming. I saw you in this big monster's dripping maw, and I thought you were being eaten.
Patrick: Uh, I wasn't being eaten. That monster is my friend. I thought you might like to meet him.
SpongeBob: I would be delighted to meet him.
Patrick: Well, in that case, SpongeBob, I would like to introduce you to... I would like to introduce you to... I forgot his name. What do I do? What do I do?
SpongeBob: Don't panic. Introduce me first. Then he'll say his name when he meets me.
Patrick: Okay. [to monster] Uh, I'd like you to meet my friend, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: And you are? [monster growls and drools all over Patrick and SpongeBob] Nice to meet you, Mr. Rrarrg! [growls. Cut to later] Well, Rrarrg, now that we're friends, I would like to show you my home.
Patrick: And this is my home.
SpongeBob: Where is your home? Oh, maybe he doesn't have a home.
Patrick: Doesn't have a home? [bell dings] Hey, wait a minute, you can live under my rock if you want, Rrarrg. [the monster puts Patrick's rock on top of his head and adjusts it. SpongeBob, Patrick, and the monster all laugh. The monster throws Patrick's rock and breaks it into pieces. Everyone laughs]
SpongeBob: Oh, he smashed your house!
Patrick: Yeah! [everyone still laughing] He's gonna smash your house now!
SpongeBob: [yelps] He's going to smash my house?! Gary! [monster throws the pineapple] Gary! Jump, Gary, jump! [Gary jumps out of the window] Parachute, Gary! Use your parachute! [Gary uses it]
Patrick: He's gonna smash Squidward's place now! [monster picks up the island head]
SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick, I don't-- [Patrick laughs]
Patrick: Encore! [monster throws Squidward's house, destroying it. Patrick claps a few time as the police cars drive up and surround Rrarrg with barbed wire fencing] Wow, the police have arrived.
SpongeBob: And they built a cute little fence around Rrarrg. [Squidward walks past] Hi, Squidward, you're home early. [Squidward walks up to the cops]
Cop: Hold it, buddy. Where are you going?
Squidward: I live here. [cops laugh] And what's so funny?
Cop: Oh, the thought of anyone living in a pile of gravel.
Squidward: I'll have you know, sir, that my home is a-- pile of gravel?! [screams]
Cop: Sir, don't yell at me. We don't want to alert the--
Squidward: Alert the what?!
Cop: That big scary monster inside the fence over there. [points. The monster waves]
SpongeBob: He waved at you, Squidward! That means he likes you!
Squidward: He likes me? Officer, arrest me right now, because I am about to throw a horrible tantrum that no one around here wants to see. [cut to later]
Cop #2: What do you think he's doing up there?
Cop #3: Who?
Cop #2: The big guy.
Cop #3: I don't know.
Cop #2: What?
Cop #3: I said I don't know.
Cop #2: [sneezes in a megaphone, which upsets the monster and runs away]
Cop #3: He's escaped!
Cop #2: Quick, everybody into the... [grabs megaphone] Quick, everybody into the squad car! [the monster runs and squishes the cop cars] Oh, darn it.
Cop #4: Now what are we going to do?
Cop #2: We shall have to chase him on foot. [monster growls as he runs away] It's headed straight for town! [they chase him into town and then stop] There, by the magazine stand! Hold it right there, bub! [monster is reading a magazine] This is a newsstand, not a library. [over megaphone] Okay, one more step, and I'll sneeze. [monster groans]
Patrick: [angrily taking one step forward in front of the monster] Wait just one minute! This is my friend! If you want to get to him, you're gonna have to go through me!
Cop #2: We're prepared to do that.
Patrick: Actually... just let me to talk to him for a minute. Psst. [monster picks him up]
Cop #2: You mean, that thing can speak?
Patrick: [scoffs] Of course! He's a giant freak of nature, not a freak of nature that can't speak. [both whisper indistinctly] And so as the lowly snail sheddeth his shell, and the lofty gull molteth his feathers, the brightest of friendships must dimmeth as the setting sun.
Cop #2: That was... [sniffles] beautiful. We still gotta run him out of town. [cut to monster waving goodbye and walking off into the distance]
Patrick: It really crushes my heart to see him go.
SpongeBob: Yeah, crushes. Patrick, ""crushes!"" That gives me an idea! [cut to a snowy mountaintop where Patrick is standing by a phone. The phone rings]
Patrick: [picks up phone] Yeah? Okay. [hangs up] Two cubes, please. [the monster crushes a block of ice into cubes. He takes two and throws them]
SpongeBob: [at the Krusty Krab] Your ice cubes, sir.
Nat: What? Where? [the ice cubes that the monster threw land in his cup] Hey, thanks, buddy.

It finally flies into SpongeBob's kitchen, where SpongeBob enjoying a bowl of Kelpo cereal with Gary. SpongeBob opens the letter, which is from his old friend, Bubble Buddy, asking him to babysit his son, Shiny. Shiny appears out of the bubble holding the letter. SpongeBob introduces himself and takes Shiny to meet Squidward. Unfortunately, Shiny causes mayhem in Squidward's house and SpongeBob cannot find him. Shiny keeps flying in Squidward's house and destroying furniture. SpongeBob is being careful so Shiny will not pop from all the sharp objects in Squidward's house, enraging him.Eventually, SpongeBob catches him and takes Shiny to the Krusty Krab.

Then, Shiny flies into the city and gets into lots of trouble.He goes into the Bikini Bottom Pin Factory, Bikini Bottom Scissor Works, and the Pitchfork Pantry. Then, SpongeBob decides to go to the Bikini Bottom Pillow Foundry since pillows are soft and harmless, only to find out that it is a dangerous place too due to the way pillows are produced.When they get home, he feeds Shiny a hot dog in the form of a bubble, but then he pops. SpongeBob has the bubble soap to repair him. Finally, when he blows another Shiny, he grows two heads. Then, Bubble Buddy comes to his house to pick up Shiny.

Woman: [hanging up clothes to let them dry. The bubble knocks the clothes off the rack] Hey, you stupid bubble, I just washed those!

Old Man Jenkins: My spine!
Man: Why don't you watch where you're going?!
Other woman: Come back here!
Old Man Jenkins: I'll sue!
[The bubble passes a fish who's eating soup, and knocks his head into the bowl. The bubble floats into SpongeBob's house.]
SpongeBob: [about to eat cereal, when the bubble goes into his mouth. He takes it, and the note, out] Hey, little bubble. Where'd you come from? Perhaps this letter will shed some light on your origin. It's from my old friend, Bubble Buddy. Wonder what's up with him. [opens letter] Let's see now. Dear SpongeBob...
[Cut to Bubble Buddy writing letter.]
Bubble Buddy: The Mrs. and I have to go away for a few days, and our regular bubble sitter is sick. Could you please watch our son, Shiny, until we get back? I owe you one. Your pal, Bubble Buddy.
[Cut back to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Please keep Shiny away from sharp objects. We don't want him to go pop like his, late Uncle Raymond. [done reading] Oh, boy! Did you hear that, Gary? They want me to watch little Shiny! Gee, I wonder when he's going to show up. The letter doesn't say. [the bubble morphs into Shiny] I can't wait to meet him! [Shiny touches SpongeBob, scaring him] Oh, hey, there you are, Shiny. Look at you. You're just as cute as the dickens. [picks him up] Upsy-Daisy! Say hello to Shiny, Gary. [Shiny blinks, and Gary hides in his shell] Oh, you're full of soap and vinegar, aren't you?

SpongeBob: ♪La la la la la la la la la la!♪ This is gonna be great, Shiny Bubble. Oop! Downsy Daffodil. Squidward loves meeting my friends.
Squidward: No, I don't. [retreats into his house]
SpongeBob: You're gonna like Squidward. He's lots of fun.
SpongeBob: [knocks on door] So, how was your trip? [knocks on door, again] You don't talk much do you? Hmm. Guess he's not home. Oh, well. We can try again, later. [Shiny floats away] Wait! Shiny, where are you going? [Shiny floats into the window] You can't go in there. You weren't invited.
[crashing noises are heard from inside]
Squidward: Would you please get your friend out of my house?
[cut to the inside of Squidward's house, which is a mess]
Squidward: Where'd he go?
SpongeBob: Squidward! This room is so full of sharp, jagged, broken things! This is no place for a delicate little bubble boy! [spots Shiny float towards cupboards] There he is! Don't worry, I'll save him. [opens several cupboards with the following items] Nope. Jagged glass. Barbed wire. Cactuses. Cactuses protected by barbed wire. Shh! Shiny must be in this one. Gotcha! [opens the cupboard and immediately reaches inside, jabbing himself with broken glass] No, guess not. [gasps] Oh no! You don't think he p-p-p-popped in there!
Squidward: There he is! He's headed right for my glass menagerie!
[Shiny slowly floats past them]
Squidward: Phew...
[Shiny floats near a broken lamp]
SpongeBob: Hold still, Shiny. I'll get you down. Gotcha! [leaps, but Shiny dodges, and SpongeBob hits the broken light bulb, gets electrocuted, and flies into the glass menagerie desk, causing them to fall and break]
Squidward: Of course.
SpongeBob: Okay, Shiny. Fun is fun, but it's time to come down, now. [tries to catch Shiny, but he misses] Barnacles!
[Shiny floats toward a spinning fan]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Oh, no!
[Shiny gets caught in the fan, escapes, and floats upstairs]
SpongeBob: Shiny, come back! [he and Squidward run upstairs] There he is! [Shiny begins to float out a window] He's headed for that open window! [the wind blows Shiny back in. Shiny grabs a paintbrush, and paints a mustache on one of Squidward's paintings]
SpongeBob: [grabs Shiny] I gotcha, you little rascal. It looks like Shiny wants to be an artist, just like you.
Squidward: SpongeBob, I spent 6 long months on that painting.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. Shiny's made of soap. We'll just wash it off. [uses Shiny to wipe the mustache off] There you go, good as new. [the painting of Squidward drips off the painting, revealing its brain, making Squidward angry] Really catches your inner self. Oh, my! Look at that! Time to go to work! See you there. Bye. [leaves]

SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Morning, laddie. What's with the glass puppet?
SpongeBob: He's not glass, Mr. Krabs. Remember Bubble Buddy? Well, I'm taking care of his son.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, Bubble Buddy, huh? That guy still owes me money. So, what's the little deadbeat's name?
SpongeBob: Allow me to introduce Shiny Bubble. [whispers] He doesn't talk much. Shake hands with Mr. Krabs, Shiny.
Mr. Krabs: [holds out hand] Put 'er there, lad. [Shiny floats in between his eyes] Hey! [almost pinches Shiny]
SpongeBob: Ooh! You might want to be careful with those claws, Mr. Krabs.
[Mr. Krabs grunts] [Shiny floats all over Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Hold still, you little rascal. [tries to grab him. SpongeBob takes Shiny away]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, I've got him. Wow, Mr. Krabs. Look how shiny Shiny made you.
Mr. Krabs: Well, now, look at that. I've never felt this clean on a weekday. Why don't you take Shiny there into the kitchen and let him play around with the dirty dishes?
[SpongeBob takes Shiny in the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Wow, I think Mr. Krabs really likes you. Now you play with these while I tend to the grill. [puts Shiny on the dishes] You sure are lucky, Shiny. You get to learn all about the glories of the the service industry.
[Shiny floats out the kitchen window]
SpongeBob: Yes siree, Shiner, you show me a sizzling grill, and I will show you a happy customer.
[Shiny slides around on the floor, leaving behind a trail of soap as he does so. Customers begin slipping all over the place]
[Harold slides on the floor until he hits his torso directly on the side of a table]
Harold: Whoa! Hernia.
Squidward: What in the name of Neptune is going on-- [steps on Shiny and slips, sending Shiny in the air. Shiny hits the ceiling, wall, and hits the cash register, opening it and money flies out]
Customer: Yoo-hoo! Free money! [cheering] Yeah, all right!
SpongeBob: There you are, Shiny. I've been looking all over for you. Thank goodness you weren't hurt.
Mr. Krabs: You better get him out of here if you want to keep him that way. [SpongeBob runs out with Shiny] Bubbles today. They don't seem to understand the value of money.
[cut to SpongeBob walking with Shiny]
SpongeBob: That's okay, Shiny. It's too dangerous for you to work at the Krusty Krab, anyway. But there are a lot of fun, safe things we can do. Like stand in place, or sit in place. Or the ""let's not move at all"" game. Patrick is really good at that one. He-
[Shiny disappeared from his hand]
SpongeBob: Shiny? Shiny where are you?
[Shiny is floating toward the city]
SpongeBob: [screams] Shiny, no! Not the city! It's too dangerous! [runs to Bikini Bottom] Shiny, where are you? [looks for Shiny and finds him floating in the middle of the street, gasps] Shiny, no! [grabs Shiny] There now. Safe and sound. [gets hit by a boat] Now, Shiny, I- [gets run over by another boat] Now, Shiny, you might- [gets run over by several more boats] That was a close one. Okay, Shiny. Let's get you back to my house and keep you away from sharp pointy things.
[Shiny floats away]
SpongeBob: Oh, tartar sauce. Ooohhh!
[two boats collide and almost hit Shiny. Shiny floats in a pin factory]
SpongeBob: ""Bikini Bottom Pin Factory""?! Shiny, no! I'll save you! [goes inside. SpongeBob is heard screaming. He comes out with pins stuck in him, and Shiny] You need to watch where you're going. You could get popped in a place like that. Hold on. There's something tickling my nose. [pulls the pin from his nose, and deflates. He blows himself back up]
[Shiny floats away]
SpongeBob: Where's Shiny? Oh, no! [Shiny floats into the Bikini Bottom Scissor Works] ""Scissor Works""? I'll save you, Shiny! [goes inside. Clipping noises are heard. SpongeBob comes out with Shiny] Oh, boy. Don't you know scissors are sharp and dangerous? Luckily, we both escaped unharmed. [becomes reduced to cubes. He puts himself back together]
[Shiny floats away again]
SpongeBob: Shiny? [Shiny floats in the pitchfork pantry] ""Pitchfork Pantry."" Of course. [walks inside] Aah! Ow. [walks out with Shiny and a pitchfork stuck in his head] Shiny, how many times do I got to tell you? No sharp, no pointy! Let's see if there's someplace safe for you to visit. Ah, that's it. ""The Pillow Foundry."" You'll like it in there. Pillows aren't dangerous. [goes inside and becomes surprised] Huh?
[a stock footage of a live-action factory is shown. Iron is shown being melted, steamed, and comes out on a conveyor belt. It is cut by a buzzsaw, and a guy uses a giant needle to jab the pillows and fling them into a pile]
SpongeBob: Okay, let's skip the pillow foundry. I'll just take you to my house.
[cut to SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Here we are. Home safe home. You must be hungry after all that running around. Now what would a growing bubble eat? [takes out bubble soap] I know! [blows a hot dog-shaped bubble, which bumps into Shiny, and pops. Shiny pops, too]
SpongeBob: [panicking] Shiny! Don't worry, Shiny, you'll be okay. [dips bubble wand into the soap puddle. He blows a monster-shaped bubble] Oh, that ain't right! [blows a dinosaur-shaped bubble] Oh, come on, now! [blows Shiny back to normal] Ah, he's okay.
[Shiny grows a second head]
SpongeBob: Uh-oh.
Bubble Buddy: Hello there, SpongeBob! How's my little boy been faring?
SpongeBob: Oh, what? Huh, oh, Shiny? He's... [hides Shiny behind his back] ...been behaving great.
Bubble Buddy: Well, now, it looks you've gone and grown another head again, Shiny.
SpongeBob: Again?
Bubble Buddy: Not to worry. I'll take care of it. [sucks Shiny into his bubble wand, and place him inside his soap bottle] So, SpongeBob, did my boy Shiny behave himself?
SpongeBob: Oh, he was just a little angel... in a little devil, sort of way.
Bubble Buddy: Well, so long, SpongeBob. [walks off] Thanks for watching my boy.
[Shiny's head pops out of the bottle and raspberries SpongeBob before Bubble Buddy hops into an airplane-shaped bubble, which takes off]
SpongeBob: So long! Bye-bye. Anytime you need a babysitter. Just give me a little advanced notice. I, uh... I work a lot. I have to check with Mr. Krabs, and, and there's Gary, he needs feeding, and, then... stand around a lot and that keeps me busy.",3.27,"Luke Brookshier,Marc Ceccarelli,Doug Lawrence"

At first, Timmy takes out a can of Fizz Bomb soda, drinks it, and then burps, but that does not work. In the second attempt, they eat a bag of spicy kelp chips, which causes their mouths to burn and then hiccup. In the process, they let out hiccup bubbles. Two of their hiccup bubbles touching each other combines into one bigger bubble and Tina gets the jar to put the bubble in. They trap the hiccup bubble in a jar, and laugh about how this will make a great prank. They release the hiccup bubble into Bikini Bottom, which is about to land on an old woman, but she unknowingly blows it away while blowing her nose. The hiccup bubble then lands on SpongeBob while he is skipping down the street, causing him to get the hiccups.Later, at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is about to prepare a fresh batch of Krabby Patties, but his hiccups interfere. At first, SpongeBob uses this to his advantage, using his hiccups to bounce the Krabby Patties off of his head, but this quickly spirals out of control. Mr. Krabs walks into the kitchen to see what is going on, to which he realizes SpongeBob has a case of the hiccups. He attempts to scare the hiccups out of him, but this proves unsuccessful. Mr. Krabs sends SpongeBob home for the day, but not before SpongeBob hiccups the bubble out of his mouth and onto Mr. Krabs, passing the hiccups onto him. Mr. Krabs walks back into the restaurant to greet Mrs. Puff, who is waiting in line, but Mr. Krabs' hiccups prove to be an annoyance. Mrs. Puff claims the hiccups are not contagious and kisses Mr. Krabs on the cheek, and Mr. Krabs unknowingly passes the hiccups onto her. Mrs. Puff then rushes into the restroom and tries drinking water upside down to get rid of the hiccups. Pearl then also walks into the restroom and is confused by what Mrs. Puff is doing. Mrs. Puff then accidentally spits water all over Pearl's pom-poms, making her upset. Mrs. Puff tries to apologize to Pearl, but ends up passing the hiccups to her, causing Pearl to storm out of the restaurant. Pearl attempts to practice cheerleading, but her hiccups get in the way. She ends up passing the hiccups to a group of jellyfish, and she happily finishes her cheer.The jellyfish then fly past the comic book store where Bubble Bass is reading a comic book, and pass the hiccups onto him. His hiccups cause him to sneeze on his comic book, making him upset. Old Man Jenkins then approaches Bubble Bass and mocks him, saying how back in his day, hiccups could turn someone inside out. This also happens to Bubble Bass, who panics and runs away. We then cut to Perch Perkins, who is reporting the Hiccup Plague on the news, but he just laughs it off until Bubble Bass (still inside out) grabs Perch Perkins' microphone, claiming the Hiccup Plague to be real. He then hiccups, causing the hiccup bubble to travel inside the microphone, and into telephone wires leading to the Chum Bucket, causing Karen to get the hiccups, who then passes the hiccups to Plankton. The hiccups cause Plankton to accidentally drop a couple of beakers he was using, which creates an explosion that sends him flying. He then lands on the ground right in front of Patrick, who ends up accidentally stepping on him. He then picks up Plankton, who ends up passing the hiccups onto him. Plankton laughs in his face and then runs away. Patrick then starts hiccupping, causing him to panic, and he bumps into Squidward. Patrick begs Squidward to help him get rid of the hiccups, but then passes the hiccups onto him. Squidward berates Patrick, saying that hiccups are not contagious, but when he starts hiccupping himself, he panics and takes off.We then see Mrs. Puff, Pearl, and Bubble Bass, who are walking down the street together. Squidward then approaches them and starts uncontrollably hiccupping. This causes them to panic and flee. Squidward is then approached by SpongeBob, who states that he will willingly take the hiccups if Squidward hugs him. He begrudgingly does so, and passes the hiccups onto SpongeBob. Squidward then retreats gleefully, while SpongeBob says goodbye to Bikini Bottom, while Timmy and Tina (the two kids from earlier) are seen giggling behind a mailbox. SpongeBob is then seen sitting on a large piece of coral while sipping on a carton of grape juice. SpongeBob then hiccups, causing him to fall off the coral, and lands in Sandy's arms. SpongeBob is alarmed and tells Sandy to stay away from him as he still has the hiccups. Sandy states that she wants to attempt to cure SpongeBob of the hiccups and take him back to her treedome.At Sandy's treedome, SpongeBob is seen in a small tank, while Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff, Pearl, Bubble Bass, Patrick, and Squidward look on. Mr. Krabs once again tries to scare the hiccups out of SpongeBob, but fails. Mrs. Puff suggests drinking water upside down, Pearl suggests to do a cheer, Bubble Bass suggests hiding pickles under his tongue, Patrick suggests eating Snail-Po, and Squidward suggests nothing. SpongeBob tries all of these options, but none of them end up working. Sandy tries to treat the situation ""scientifically"" and tickles SpongeBob, which actually ends up working. The hiccup bubble floats out of the Treedome as everyone cheers. The hiccup bubble then floats back to the treehouse where Tina and Timmy are laughing, but the hiccups are passed onto them. They both start hiccupping, causing their treehouse to jump up and down, as the episode ends.",Hiccup Plague,"[The episode begins at a tree house, where two kids are laughing.]
Timmy: [takes out a can of Fizz Bomb soda and drinks it, then burps] How's that, Tina?
Tina: No, Timmy, we want a hiccup. [holds some Spicy Kelp Chips] Try this!
[Tina puts some Spicy Kelp Chips in her mouth and gives some to Timmy. They both eat it, and then their faces light on fire and spin around. When they fall back to the ground, they hiccup, then the hiccup bubbles combine and Tina gets the jar to put the bubble in.]
Tina: Yes, we have created the worst case of hiccups in history! [laughs]
Timmy: This is gonna make a great prank.
[They release the hiccup bubble into Bikini Bottom, which is about to land on an old woman, but she unknowingly blows it away while blowing her nose.]
[The hiccup bubble then lands on SpongeBob while he's whistling and skipping down the street.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] It tickles! [hiccup] What was that? [hiccups while Tina and Timmy laugh]
[Later at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is still hiccuping as he opens the freezer. He gets a box of patties, which fly onto the grill as he hiccups. He laughs as he starts flipping the patties. He hiccups again, causing the patty to fly in the air, and again, this time bouncing the patty back onto the grill.]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah.
[SpongeBob proceeds to use his hiccups to bounce the patties back and forth while flipping them.]
SpongeBob: Well, that's it.
[One of the patties fall to the floor, and the other patties fall in other places such as the deep fryer.]
SpongeBob: Oh, no!
Squidward: SpongeBob! Hurry up with that order! [gets patty on his eye and gets it off] Mr. Krabs! SpongeBob is up to more nonsense again! [gasps and avoids patties, and Incidental 41's Krabby Patty gets more Krabby Patties in until one patty knocks him out]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] Two whole days without nonsense, [changes the two on the chalkboard to a zero] for a good run, Mr. Squidward. But we both knew it couldn't last. [enters kitchen] SpongeBob, what shenanigans are you up to now?
SpongeBob: [hiccups, then another patty hits the ceiling] I— [hiccup] hiccup— [hiccup] down with something, Mr. Kra— [hiccup]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] You just got a case of the hiccups, son.
SpongeBob: Are they dangerous?
Mr. Krabs: No, of course not! And I [tucks his pants] have a foolproof hiccup cure. Using an old navy trick.
SpongeBob: ""Old navy trick?"" [gulps] Okay. Go for it.
Mr. Krabs: Boo.
SpongeBob: [has no reaction at first, then screams] Huh? I'm cured! [laughs but hiccups again]
Mr. Krabs: Eugh. This might be a tougher case than I thought. Why don't you go home and sleep it off? [patty falls from ceiling]
SpongeBob: Oh, but I don't wanna go... [hiccups one last time and the hiccup bubble comes out of SpongeBob and goes to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: [shakes his head] Uh, sorry, boy-o. [slams door]
SpongeBob: Oh, stupid hiccups. [notices his hiccups are gone] Hey hey, they're gone! [whistles while walking away]
Mr. Krabs: [hiccups] Oh... hiccups. Hiccups are nothing to a old navy man like me. [hiccups and laughs while leaving the kitchen]
Mrs. Puff: Hello, Eugene. [pinches his cheek] How’s my little Krabby-Wabby-Oooooh?
Mr. Krabs: Doing fine now that you're here, Puffykins. [hiccups, then covers mouth and hiccups while eyes pop out]
Mrs. Puff: Oh my! Are you alright?
Mr. Krabs: [muffles mouth and tells the truth] SpongeB— [hiccups] given me a case of— [hiccups] hiccups!
Mrs. Puff: Oh Eugene, hiccups aren't contagious. [kisses Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: [hiccups one last time and the hiccup bubble is out of Mr. Krabs and gets to Mrs. Puff, then he laughs] Me hiccups! They're gone! Oh your kisses are magical, Puff!
Mrs. Puff: Oh Eu- [hiccups] Dear me! I have to— [hiccups] powder my gills! [hiccups and enters bathroom] I got to get rid of these rotten hiccups before I pop! [hiccups and turns on sink to drink water]
Pearl: Oh hi Mrs.... Puff?
Mrs. Puff: Oh hello- [water comes out of her mouth, getting Pearl wet]
Pearl: Ohh... my pompoms!
Mrs. Puff: Oh, Pearl, I'm so sorry. [hiccups one last time and the hiccup bubble escapes from Mrs. Puff and gets to Pearl]
Pearl: [gasps and gets out of the bathroom]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! My hiccups. They've stopped.
Pearl: [does her cheerleading] Go... [hiccups] [spins] Team... [hiccups] Ugh! I can't cheer like this! [hiccups one last time and the hiccup bubble is out of Pearl] Rah rah rah! Go Pearl!
[The hiccup bubble heads toward a group of jellyfish and gets to them. The jellyfishes start to hiccup as they head toward Bikini Bottom. The Jellyfish hiccup one last time and the bubble gets to Bubble Bass, who is reading a comic book and drinking soda.]
Bubble Bass: [hiccups and spits out the kelp soda coming out of his nose, ruining his comic] No! That hiccup ruined my precious comic book!
Old Man Jenkins: [comes by] You call them hiccups? Ah! [pokes Bubble Bass with his cane] Back in my day, hiccups could turn a fella inside out. [Bubble Bass hiccups as his whole body turns inside out. Bubble Bass screams and runs away] Now that's what I call a hiccup.
[Bubble transition to Perch Perkins from the Bikini Bottom News.]
Perch Perkins: You won't believe this, folks. But there are reports of a contagious hiccup plague spreading throughout Bikini Bottom. [laughs] [Bubble Bass, still inside out, comes by, panicking]
Bubble Bass: The hiccup plague is real! Save yourselves! [hiccups one last time and the hiccup bubble comes out of him and into the mic as it goes into the cable by traveling toward the Chum Bucket]
Perch Perkins: So what do you think, folks? Is it real? [the hiccup goes in Karen's face]
Plankton: [doing an experiment, holding test tubes] Contagious hiccups? [scoffs] What a bunch of idiots.
Karen: Huh? [hiccups]
[Plankton gets the hiccups.]
Plankton: [hiccups, stammers, and then gets launched out of the Chum Bucket and then Patrick steps on him]
Plankton: Ow, watch it, you clod! [hiccups three times]
[Patrick picks up Plankton, who hiccups and spreads it to Patrick.]
Plankton: My hiccups! They're gone! [pokes Patrick] Now you have 'em! [runs away laughing as Patrick hiccups]
Patrick: Oh, no! [screams and runs around until he bumps into Squidward. He shakes Squidward] You gotta help me, Squidward. I've caught the hiccups! [he lets out the hiccup, and it spreads to Squidward]
Squidward: Huh? [slaps Patrick backward] You can't catch the hiccups, you nitwit.
[Patrick hides under a rock like a crab.]
Squidward: What [hiccups] an ignoramus. [hiccups] Huh? [hiccups repeatedly, then screams as he runs out onto the street]
[Bubble Bass, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl are walking along the street, as Squidward runs to them, who starts hiccuping repeatedly.]
Mrs. Puff: Squidward has the hiccups! Run for your lives!
The trio scream and run away from Squidward. Squidward hiccups and falls to the ground.]
Squidward: [hiccups] Must get rid of these hiccups.
SpongeBob: [taking Squidward's hand and lifting him up] I'll take them, Squidward.
Squidward: SpongeBob? [hiccups]
SpongeBob: [hugs Squidward] There, there.
Squidward: It's not [hiccups] working.
SpongeBob: You have to hug me back.
Squidward: [groans as he hesitantly tries to hug SpongeBob back]
SpongeBob: You have to mean it.
Squidward: [hugs SpongeBob, and releases the hiccup bubble]
SpongeBob: There you go. Come to me, little hiccup. [the bubble pops on top of him, making him hiccup]
Squidward: Thank you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I need no thanks. [hiccups] It's enough to know my sacrifice [hiccups] will be remembered forever. [hiccups]
Squidward: I'm free! [runs away, cheering] Oh, yeah!
SpongeBob: [somberly] Goodbye, Squidward. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. I'll take this hiccups where they won't harm anyone again. [hiccups and walks away]
[As SpongeBob continues hiccuping, Tina and Timmy laugh behind a mailbox. The scene bubble transitions to SpongeBob sitting on some coral, hiccuping. He takes out his lunchbox and grabs some grape juice. He tries to drink it, but hiccups again, sending him flying into the air and lands in Sandy's arms. Sandy is in a hazmat suit.]
Sandy: I've got you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Stay away, Sandy! Or you'll catch these horrible hiccups! [hiccups]
Sandy: Aw, don't worry. In my new hazmat suit, I'm safer than a bowling ball in a pillow factory. Besides, I'm here to [pokes SpongeBob's nose] cure you of those darn hiccups. But first, I best put you in quarantine. [drops SpongeBob into a rolling trash can, and she pushes it along]
[Bubble transition to Sandy's treedome, where SpongeBob is in his own glass box. Patrick, Mrs. Puff, Squidward, Bubble Bass, Pearl, and Mr. Krabs are all watching him.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey guys. [hiccups around the box]
[Sandy pushes an x-ray up to SpongeBob, which reveals the hiccup bubble stuck in his body.]
Sandy: Woo-wee! That is one industrial-strength hiccup! Don't you worry nun', we'll get it out.
Mr. Krabs: Step aside. This old navy man will take care of it. [holds an animal mask and puts it on; he approaches the box] Boo.
[After a delay, SpongeBob screams. He then hiccups and inflates to a giant size, scaring Mr. Krabs as well.]
Mrs. Puff: Try drinking water, upside down.
Pearl: [cheerleading] Try a cheer! [chuckles]
Bubble Bass: [pulls his tongue to reveal pickles under it, like in the ""Pickles"" episode] Put a pickle under your tongue.
Patrick: [mouth full] Try eating some Snail Po!
SpongeBob: Um, okay! [grabs a hose and fills himself with water, and tries to cover his holes as he still hiccups] [with pom-poms] Hip-hip! [hiccups and releases the pom-poms] [swallows a bunch of pickles from a jar, but releases them with a hiccup] [he pulls out a can of Snail Po as he hesitantly eats it] Blech. [meows; he hiccups and launches himself into the air and falls back down]
Sandy: Squidward? [everyone looks at Squidward]
Squidward: Huh? I got nothing.
Sandy: We'll have to treat it scientifically. [inserts her arms through two holes in the box] And tickle! [tickles SpongeBob, which eventually releases the hiccup bubble]
[The bubble travels through a tube, and it is released into the air.]
Everyone: Hooray!
SpongeBob: [weakly] Hooray.
[The bubble makes its way back into the treehouse, where the two kids are on the floor laughing. It pops.]
Timmy and Tina: Uh oh.

A lobster named Larry comes by and asks them if they want to do some weights. They accept, even though SpongeBob is not in the mood to do weights. Larry and Sandy do several impressive weight stunts, while SpongeBob tries to pick up a stick. When SpongeBob strains to pick up a stick with two marshmallows on the sides, he accidentally rips his pants.This causes everyone to laugh, prompting SpongeBob to continue making ripped pants jokes. After a while, though, SpongeBob's jokes start to annoy the people in Goo Lagoon. At some point, SpongeBob fakes himself drowning in order to make a ripped pants joke, but this proves to be too far, as it causes everyone, most importantly Sandy, to get disgusted with SpongeBob and continue playing without him.SpongeBob tries to figure out more ripped pants jokes as the last one did not work but realizes nobody is paying attention to him, and tears off his pants during the course of one of these jokes. The pair of pants suddenly takes on a personality and deserts SpongeBob as well. He sees some other people who make big mistakes. SpongeBob decides to sing a song about how he lost his friends due to ripping his pants. Sandy forgives SpongeBob for what he did, and he rips his underwear while signing Larry's shorts, making him embarrassed.",Ripped Pants,"[The episode begins at Goo Lagoon. The camera pans across the lagoon.]
French Narrator: Ah, Goo Lagoon. A stinky mud puddle to you and me. But to the inhabitants of Bikini Bottom, a wonderful, stinky mud puddle. [SpongeBob and Sandy sit enjoying the beach. SpongeBob sighs]
SpongeBob: What a great day. [runs off] Hey, Sandy! Look! [now covered in a mound of sand] I'm Sandy! [Sandy laughs. SpongeBob forms sand around his head and nose to look like Squidward and imitates his voice] Hey Sandy, who am I? [Sandy still laughs. SpongeBob picks up a sand phone while imitating Squidward.] Hello, SpongeBob. Could you keep it down? I'm trying to be boring. [Sandy continues laughing]
Sandy: SpongeBob! [a doorbell rings, SpongeBob walks in carrying sand pizza boxes and wearing a Krusty Krab sand hat]
SpongeBob: [normal voice] Did anyone order twenty pepperoni and sand pizzas? [he and Sandy laugh together. A red lobster walks up]
Larry the Lobster: Hey, Sandy. Hey, SpongeBob.
Sandy: Hey, Larry.
Larry: You guys wanna go lift some weights?
Sandy: Sure. [she and Larry walk off] Well, come on, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob's sand pizzas and hat fall flat as he walks on dejectedly]
SpongeBob: [disappointingly] Coming. [cut to a group of weightlifters, each grunting as they work out. Larry turns to Sandy]
Larry: Give it a try, Sandy. [Sandy stands in front of a weight. She picks it up, grunting as she does so. The crowd cheers for her, and she throws the weight down]
SpongeBob: Good job, Sandy. Well, that's about enough for today, don't you think? [tries to walk off]
Larry: How about a little more weight? [bends down to pick up a weight heavier than Sandy's] Observe. [grunts as he picks it up, his eyes bulging, and veins stick out from his neck. The crowd cheers, and Larry throws the weight down]
SpongeBob: All right, stand back, everyone. [picks up a single twig from the ground. The crowd is silent. He sinks into the sand. Sandy walks to a weight]
Sandy: Y'all watch this! [picks up an anchor weight. The crowd cheers for her, but stop when they realize Larry has lifted the spectator stands] Way to go, Larry! [SpongeBob burrows into the sand, and tunnels over to Incidental 36 who is picnicking next to a marshmallow sack]
SpongeBob: Could I borrow a couple of these?
Incidental 36: [through his marshmallow-filled mouth] Mm-hmm. [crams another marshmallow into his mouth.]
SpongeBob: [takes two marshmallows and places them on the twig] And now, with the addition of two-- count 'em, two marshmallows. [preps himself for his lift, inhales deeply, takes hold of the twig, and is unable to lift it. The crowd isn't moved. He tries again. And again. After a huge effort, SpongeBob hears a rip, causing the crowd to gasp. He looks down and notices that he's ripped his pants. The crowd then laughs at SpongeBob. SpongeBob scuttles off, embarrassed. Scooter walks over, laughing]
Scooter: That was too funny. [slaps SpongeBob on the back] You are hilarious!
Sandy: Ain't he the funniest little Sponge you ever saw? [SpongeBob grins widely which gave him an idea. The scene cuts to Larry with a volleyball on his claw]
Larry: Anybody up for some volleyball? [the ball volleys back and forth, until Larry spikes it into some fish and the crowd cheers for him. SpongeBob looks at him in contempt. A fish serves the ball and as Larry is about to hit it, SpongeBob interferes]
SpongeBob: I got it! [the ball falls and SpongeBob tries to serve it] Incoming! [the serve misses and the crowd boos. He bends down to pick the ball up and rips his pants] Oops, I guess I ripped my pants again! [the crowd laughs. Scooter walks in laughing again]
Scooter: Once again, dude, [slaps SpongeBob on the back] you have split my sides! [he continues to laugh. The scene cuts to a tossed Frisbee. Larry catches it and throws it to Sandy]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, how about throwing it to me?
Sandy: Okay, here it comes! [SpongeBob stands still and lets the Frisbee hit him on the head, knocking him over]
SpongeBob: I could use a hand here! [laughs. Sandy walks over and helps him up]
Sandy: You okay, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I guess so... [does a handstand, revealing his pants] ...except I ripped my pants! [the crowd laughs, and Scooter walks up to SpongeBob once again]
Scooter: You still got it, dude! [slaps SpongeBob on the back again. The scene cuts to SpongeBob and Sandy walking to an ice cream vendor]
Incidental 39: May I help you?
SpongeBob: I'll take a banana split.
Incidental 39: Uh, we don't have that.
SpongeBob: That's okay. I already split my pants! Get it? [Sandy giggles]
Incidental 39: [annoyed] Tee-hee. Anything else?
SpongeBob: How about ripple? [does so, Sandy giggles again] No, thanks, already got one! [Sandy drops laughing, Incidental 39 is unamused, and SpongeBob happily bounces off to a snack bar. SpongeBob runs up to Incidental 40, knocking his drink over] Is that a burger you're eating?
Incidental 40: Why, yes, it is.
SpongeBob: You know what would go good with that?
Incidental 40: No, what?
SpongeBob: [whispers] Ripped... pants. [smiles widely and shows the annoyed Incidental 40 his ripped pants. SpongeBob then runs around the snack bar, laughing. He comes up in-between two fish] Ripped pants a la mode! [rips his pants, the fish are annoyed. Cut to SpongeBob being in the kitchen of the snack bar, next to the fry cook] Delivery! Did you order twenty cases of ripped pants? [shoves his behind through the box, revealing his ripped pants, then laughs and the box is revealed to have no lower part. The fry cook groans disgustedly. The scene cuts to a broadcasting booth over-looking the lagoon]
Sports guy: Surf's up in the Goo Lagoon! [fish are surfing. Close-up of Perch Perkins] And here comes Larry, doing his trademark lay-back! [cut to Larry lying on his surfboard] There goes Sandy, hanging ten... fingers, that is. [cut to Sandy doing a handstand on her surfboard] There goes SpongeBob... [rip] ripping his pants again. [The sports guy is annoyed, then cut to SpongeBob ripping his pants on his surfboard. A wave knocks SpongeBob off his surfboard and washes him up on the beach]
Incidental 155: Hey, look, a cardboard box washed up on the beach. [takes a closer look through his telescope] Holy fish paste! It's a guy! [sprints over to SpongeBob and flips him over] Why?! Why?! WHY?! [a crowd gathers around SpongeBob and Incidental 155]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [to Incidental 155] Come closer. [a divine light shines on him] I need... I need...
Incidental 155: What do you need? [tears come to Incidental 155's and Sandy's eyes]
SpongeBob: [pats Incidental 155 on the shoulder. Close up of SpongeBob's mouth] A tailor. [the light turns off, accompanied by a light switch] Because I ripped my pants! [laughs. Incidental 155 makes an annoyed expression, drops SpongeBob, and the crowd surrounding him walks off with annoyance. SpongeBob is left alone and Sandy walks up to him angry]
Sandy: That wasn't funny, SpongeBob! Y'all had me worried sick! [walks off as Scooter walks towards SpongeBob and looks at him sadly]
Scooter: [shakes his head] Dude... [walks off. Ripping transition to a dressing tent, with SpongeBob inside]
SpongeBob: [thinking] Come on, SpongeBob, you're losing them! Think! Your public's waiting. [speaking] Let's see... [checking them off a list] ""Lifting weights - big laugh,"" ""Frisbee in face - kills,"" ""Surfing - knocks 'em dead,"" ""Pretending to drown,"" [uses his pencil to write the word ""NO"" and circle it] No. Come on, think! I got it! Hey, everybody! [runs out of the dressing tent] Not ripped pants! [tears his pants off] Pants ripped off. Huh? Someone call the police. There's a pants thief on the loose! [the wind howls, SpongeBob standing alone on the beach. A tumbleweed rolls by. SpongeBob turns and hears party music at a distance, and sees Larry and Sandy playing volleyball] Oh, no, everybody's gone, even Sandy. She'd rather hang out with Larry! Oh, no. [lies on the beach as he continues saying, no] We blew it, pants. [throws his pants aside]
Pants: What do you mean, ""we?"" [the pants walk off, leaving SpongeBob alone]
SpongeBob: Oh, I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?! [Incidental 22 walks up to SpongeBob, shining red]
Incidental 22: No, I am. I forgot to put on sunscreen. [places a fin on herself, and it leaves a sounding mark, which vanishes]
SpongeBob: Ouch. [a fish walks up to the two]
Loser 2: No, I am. I got sand in my buns. [shows them two sandy hamburger buns. There is a rumbling coming from the sand and a whale pops his head out of the sand]
Loser 3: No, I'm the biggest loser on the beach. They buried me in the sand and forgot me.
All: What happened to you?
SpongeBob: I lost my best friend.
All: How? [SpongeBob grabs a sand guitar and sings he is front of the sand castle and a sand telephone he built earlier]
SpongeBob: When I ripped... [his underwear starts ripping] my pants. [starts to sing] I thought that I had everybody by my side, but I went and blew it all sky-high, and now she won't even spare a passing glance… [a curtain comes down and a spotlight shines on SpongeBob] …all just because I… [rips his underwear again] …ripped my pants. [the other three ""losers of the beach"" assemble on a sand stage with sand instruments and sing]
All: ♪When big Larry came round just to put him down, SpongeBob turned into a clown, and no girl ever wants to dance with a fool who went and [Incidental 22 turns around and suddenly, her bottom then rips, splitting open, revealing her white underwear] ripped his pants!♪
SpongeBob: [singing voice, a crowd begins to gather] ♪I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse, but the pain feels so much worse. 'Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun...♪
All: ♪Or sand in your buns!♪ [instrumental break. The loser scrapes the two buns together to make a rhythm then the curtain shows waves crashing about]
SpongeBob: ♪Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget... so listen and you won't regret. Be true to yourself; don't miss your chance... and you won't end up like the fool... who... ripped... his... pants!♪ [the whole group comes together one by one in sync with the music and they rip their pants. By now, a huge crowd has gathered and is cheering the group onstage. A blimp flies by with SpongeBob's name on it. It's revealed that SpongeBob and his band were having a concert.]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Sandy! [she gets onstage and hugs SpongeBob. He returns the embrace]
Sandy: Your song is true. If y'all want to be my friend, just be yourself. [Larry walks up]
Larry: [impressed with SpongeBob's singing during the big concert] SpongeBob, that was so righteous. [hands SpongeBob a pencil] Would you... sign my pants?
SpongeBob: Absolutely, buddy. [SpongeBob bends down to sign Larry's pants. His underwear then rips off completely, leaving SpongeBob ""au naturel."" Someone off-screen whistles. SpongeBob covers his crotch, grins, and blushes sheepishly, ending the episode.]",2.51,"Paul Tibbitt,Peter Burns"

Everyone goes to his house, only to be surprised and disappointed that they are going to see vacation slides, which they do not care about. They are about to leave, but SpongeBob persuades them back.The adventure starts with Patrick squirting the Cheese Fizz on the camera. SpongeBob's parents pull up and get him and Patrick in.

Margaret sees a playground and offers SpongeBob and Patrick to play on it. They do, but they slide down a sewer pipe and onto a small puddle.When they get up, they try to get back up, but they cannot. They enter a mysterious red kelp forest with many mushrooms. They hear a hollering noise and run. It turns out it is a small creature. They jump over a cliff, onto an anemone and onto a mushroom. Behind Patrick is a giant fruit fly. They run away and go behind a rock. They hear a noise. It came from a gift shop. SpongeBob wastes his money on useless knick-knacks. They sing the road song wearily. Then, SpongeBob decides to play the road song on a flute he bought at the gift shop.They walk along past Harold and Margaret and into the forest again. Animals follow them. The animals suddenly run away because the giant fruit fly is behind them. SpongeBob stops playing. When they turn around, they see the fruit fly wants to give them a lift. They then sing the above the road song. He drops SpongeBob and Patrick off. SpongeBob's parents call them over, but SpongeBob and Patrick just fall asleep.

Mr. Krabs: [With his eyes closed] Please be money, please be money. [Pulls out postcard from mailbox.] Oh! That's not money. It's from SpongeBob. [Puts on his glasses, and reads the postcard] ""Dear Mr... Krabs, please come to my house tonight. I am having a free money party."" Free money party!? This sounds too good to be true!

Squidward: [Reads postcard] ""Dear Squidward, come to my house tonight, I am having a... [surprised] ...latte sipping contest?"" This sounds too good to be true!

SpongeBob: [opens the door] Welcome, friends! Please come in!
[Everyone walks inside]
SpongeBob: I'm so glad you all could make it! Tonight is going to be a magical evening filled with... magic!
Mr. Krabs: Eh... SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Can we skip the magic and get right to the free money?
Squidward: How 'bout the latte sipping?
Larry: And what about the pumping of the iron?
Plankton: And diabolical conspiracies?
Sandy: And let's not forget the science fair!
SpongeBob: The real reason I called you here was to watch this slideshow of photos from my family vacation!
Squidward, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, Mrs. Puff, Larry, and Pearl: I knew it was too good to be true!
[Patrick then bursts through the crowd]
Patrick: Ahaha! Ahaha! Sorry I'm late, SpongeBob! I had to find my movie watching hat!
Plankton: That does it... I'm gone. [Plankton starts to leave, but the others exit, and Larry squishes him, followed by Pearl, Mrs. Puff, and Sandy, all stepping on him] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! You're going to miss the first slide! [Clicks button and sticks his tongue out]
[A slide of Patrick appears on the screen next to the wall.]
Squidward: Looks more like a slip than a slide. Ha ha!
Mr. Krabs: I've seen enough.
[They start leaving while Sandy is angry]
SpongeBob: Wait! Come back! [Moves projector] See, it's Patrick!
Patrick: Hey! It's me!
Squidward: Why is it all orange and blurry?
SpongeBob: Where?
Squidward: See, right there on the entire thing!
SpongeBob: Oh! That's because Patrick kept spraying the camera with Cheese Fizz!
[Ripples to SpongeBob taking picture]
SpongeBob: Patrick! You're spraying the camera with Cheese Fizz! The pictures will come out all orange and blurry.
Patrick: I can't help it, SpongeBob! I'm so excited about going on a family vacation with you and your parents that my aim is off! [Patrick sprays himself in the eye with Cheese Fizz.] See? [Patrick blinks, squirting the Cheese Fizz into his mouth and then licks his lips.] There we go...
SpongeBob: I know what you mean. Sometimes it feels like I've been waiting my entire life to go on this trip!
Patrick: Really? Why is that?
SpongeBob: Probably because I have.
Patrick: Have what?
SpongeBob: Been waiting.
Patrick: [Breathing heavily] Wait... you mean so... What?
[SpongeBob throws the camera behind him and then gasps]
SpongeBob: Patrick! They're here!
[SpongeBob's parents pull up in their station wagon. Harold pokes his head out of the window.]
Harold: Good morning son, are you ready to head out?
SpongeBob: You bet!
Margaret: SpongeBob! Don't leave your luggage behind! [points to Patrick]
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's not luggage, it's Patrick! He's coming with us, remember?
Harold: Well, shake a leg, boys. The Great Barrier Reef isn't gonna visit itself!
Margaret: Your father's right, son!
Harold: [Muttering] They know I'm right...
[Cuts to the family driving.]
Patrick: [As SpongeBob pulls out a map] You brought homework?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, it's a brochure detailing all the fun we'll have at our final destination! [opens brochure] The Great Barrier Reef! See? there's a huge assortment of slides, and trampolines...
Patrick: [Drooling] And forts...
SpongeBob: And ropes to swing on...
Patrick: [Still drooling] And forts.
SpongeBob: And a water park! [Camera zooms out, pans to Patrick drooling on map.] Oh wait, that's just where you drooled on it. [Closes brochure] I can't wait to get there! How about you?
Patrick: No, I can't.
SpongeBob: [With his eyes closed] Yeah...
Patrick: [Sweating] No, I mean I really can't. [Shouting] I've been in this confined space for too long, somebody help! [bangs on the car windows] Get me out of here!

Harold: Egad!
[Car spins out of control, crashing into a sign for The Great Barrier Reef. The car crashes in the Outskirts Outlet Mega Mall, bouncing through. The car goes down the escalator, while a tan female fish looks over at the car, and doesn't seem to care. The car then crashes out of the mall, flying through the air, and landing on a race track.]
Announcer: There's the green flag and the race is underway. [The car bounces off of a siren, and then circles the track. The car crosses the finish line, and wins the race.] And we have a new winner!
[The crowd cheers, and the car crashes through the trophies, exiting the race. The car leaves the ocean, and flies into the air, eventually flying through space. The car hits the cow that jumped over the moon, and falls back down into the ocean. The car crashes between a multitude of rocks, before landing back on the road, and driving away with Patrick now inside.]
SpongeBob: Maybe we should just sing the road song.
Patrick: ♪Road! Road! Road! Road!♪ [Continues for rest of song]

SpongeBob: Um... anybody know any other good road tunes?
[Cut to the gang pushing the car, sans Patrick who thinks he is pushing the car, but is not pushing anything.]
SpongeBob: How much farther to the nearest service station?
Harold: Probably pretty far son.
[Cuts to show road sign that shows that the nearest service station is ""Probably pretty far.""]
SpongeBob: Oh, you're right!
[Gang continues to push car, cut to them at a service station.]
Harold: So, uh, how's it lookin'?
Service Station Worker: [Pointing to objects in car] Well, it's got a cracked timing case cover, you've broken a couple teeth off the timing gear, your radiator is damaged at the core, you got a cracked water pump, and a fractured injector line.
Margaret: And what does all that mean?
Service Station Worker: Well, little missy, in technical terms... if she don't wanna run, she don't wanna run!
[Cuts to Margaret and Harold staring blankly.]
Harold: Uh-huh. So what are we looking at time wise?
Service Station Worker: Well, now, that depends... how much time ya got? [Service Station Worker starts laughing]
Patrick: [Laughing] How much time ya- [All stare at Patrick] Not funny.
[SpongeBob takes a picture.]
SpongeBob: Hey at least they have a cozy-looking waiting room! [Points to outhouse.] Come on!
[Cut to the gang in the outhouse. Harold is reading the paper and Margaret is knitting. SpongeBob and Patrick are waiting silently.]
SpongeBob: Man, am I bored.
Patrick: I am beyond bored. I am... be...yond.
Margaret: [Looking out window] Oh boys! Is that a playground I see?
[SpongeBob and Patrick stare blankly for a few moments before running to the playground, hollering ""Playground!"" They slow down upon noticing all the mud around the playground]
Patrick: Not the most colorful playground I've seen.
SpongeBob: Mm-mmm. This looks more like a grey-ground.
Cuts to swings, slide, and see-saw. SpongeBob takes a picture.
Margaret: Well I'll just let you two amuse yourselves and come back for you when the boat's fixed.
SpongeBob: [Turns to Margaret] Actually this place seems a little bit-
Margaret: Have fun!
Patrick: Well, this is a nasty turn of events.
SpongeBob: You're preaching to the choir, Patrick.
Patrick: [Crosses arms] I knew it was gonna happen, too.
SpongeBob: You did? How?
Patrick: [Turns around to reveal Cheese Fizz spread across his shorts, reaches into pocket] Because it happens every time I keep my cheese fizz in my back pocket! [Sprays remaining cheese fizz into mouth before running out.] Darn! It's almost empty!
SpongeBob: [Walking towards see-saw] Well, I guess we'll have to make the best of it. [Jumps onto see-saw while laughing.] This is fun! Hey Patrick, you- [SpongeBob's speech becomes incoherent as he sinks into the mud.]
Patrick: [Spraying Cheese Fizz into mouth] Huh? [Patrick walks towards the mud that SpongeBob had sunk into.] SpongeBob, were you talking to me? [SpongeBob reaches his arms out of the mud] I could have sworn SpongeBob was calling me from this direction. SpongeBob, where are you?!
[SpongeBob pulls himself out from the mud by grabbing onto Patrick. Patrick is now sitting on top of SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Huh? SpongeBob? Oh come on, where are you hiding? This isn't funny! [Looking around] Huh. [Puts hands on hips]
SpongeBob: [Pokes Patrick] Patrick, I'm right here.
Patrick: [Looks at SpongeBob] Oh, hey SpongeBob! How'd ya get there?
SpongeBob: Well, I was on this see-saw-
Patrick: [Yelling] Slide! [Bounces off of SpongeBob and onto slide. Patrick laughs and attempts to go down slide, but gets stuck and has to force himself down. The slide gets stuck to his bottom. Patrick tries to pull the slide off, but fails. The slide hits Patrick, and he goes flying.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, do you need help?
Patrick: [Walks up to SpongeBob with side still stuck] Huh? With the slide stuck to my bottom? Nah, I want it there. [Patrick stands motionless for a second.] I hate you slide! [Pull slide off, flattening SpongeBob. SpongeBob sits motionless on the sand.] Oh, sorry SpongeBob. [Patrick pulls the slide off and throws it behind him]
SpongeBob: [Wobbles back up] Hey look, a swingset! [Flops over to the swings, pulling himself back up] Can't go wrong with this old-time playground favorite. [SpongeBob swings on swing set.] Weee. Hey, this is almost like being at The Great Barrier Reef, huh? Try it, Patrick.
Patrick: Okay. [Patrick sits motionless on swing.] It's not working.
SpongeBob: [Swinging] Go back and forth like this. [Patrick starts swinging] There you go! Now you're getting into the... swing of things! [Laughing]
Patrick: [Starts laughing] Hey, watch me go!
[Patrick breaks the swing set and flies off, screaming]
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: [Rolls into fence, breaking it and starts falling down a slide]
SpongeBob: Patrick! I'm coming!
[SpongeBob and Patrick slide down the water slide, screaming, while going down multiple sharp turns. SpongeBob and Patrick end up in a puddle]
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: [Muffled] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Patrick! Are you okay?
Patrick: No, I'm not okay.
SpongeBob: You're not?
Patrick: No, I'm great! That was awesome! Let's do it again!
SpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick, wait for me.
[SpongeBob and Patrick climb up the slide, falls back down]
SpongeBob: Something tells me that is a one-way drain.
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick walking through a strange forest.]
SpongeBob: [Groaning] How long have we been walking here, Patrick?
Patrick: Well, that depends on who you ask.
SpongeBob: Why?
Patrick: Well, if you ask someone with a watch, they might be able to tell you.
[Monster growling]
SpongeBob: Are you getting hungry?
Patrick: Yeah! How'd you know?
SpongeBob: I could hear your stomach growling. For a second I thought it was some scary monster coming to eat us.
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing]
Patrick: That's funny! Couldn't have been my stomach growling though.
SpongeBob: It couldn't?
Patrick: [Poking stomach] Nope. I had its vocal cords removed before the trip.
SpongeBob: Well, I could've sworn that I heard-
(Monster growling)
Patrick: SpongeBob, I heard it! I heard growling!
SpongeBob: No, that time it was my stomach. There's got to be something around here to eat. [Picks berry and puts it in mouth] Patrick, I found some berries we can- [SpongeBob inflates, body turns purple] not eat!
Patrick: [Patrick eating] Thanks for the warning.
SpongeBob: Patrick, where did you get [Pulls out needle, pops self] the kelp cake?
Patrick: From the vending machine! [Camera pans to vending machine]
SpongeBob: Oh.
[Monster growling]
Patrick: Was it your stomach that time too?
SpongeBob: Nope. Run for your life!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run]
[Small creature appears, growls]
SpongeBob: It's getting closer! [SpongeBob and Patrick almost fall of cliff] Oh no! It's a sheer drop-off! What do we do?
Patrick: Don't ask me! I don't remember ""being eaten alive"" on this trip's itinerary.
SpongeBob: I'm too young to be digested! [Jumps onto Patrick, crying]
Patrick: Wait, SpongeBob! I know how to get us out of this!
SpongeBob: You do?
Patrick: I saw something like this in a movie once! Now watch closely, and do exactly what I do!
SpongeBob: Roger!
[SpongeBob and Patrick jump off of cliff]
SpongeBob: Okay, now what?
Patrick: Uh... I'm not sure, I fell asleep in the second half of the movie!
[Both screaming]
Patrick: Well, I hope that monster's carrying some syrup!
SpongeBob: Yeah, cause if he's eating us, he's having pancakes for lunch!
[SpongeBob and Patrick land on sea anemone, bounce off and land on plant. SpongeBob and Patrick laughing with heavy breath]
SpongeBob: Patrick, we did it!
Patrick: We're not gonna be eaten!
SpongeBob: Hooray for not being eaten!
Patrick: Hooray! [Laughing]
SpongeBob & Patrick: We're not gonna be eaten! We're not gonna be eaten!
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick?
Patrick: All this not being eaten is making me hungry.
SpongeBob: Oh, don't worry. When we get to The Great Barrier Reef, we'll eat like kings!
Patrick: Alright!
SpongeBob: Alright! Now put 'er there, Patrick!
Patrick: Put 'er there!
SpongeBob: Ooh Patrick, have you been using a different moisturizer? Your hands feel kind of- [Screaming]
[Monster appears behind Patrick]
Patrick: Oh no, it's just the same old moisturizer I always use.
[SpongeBob panicking]
Patrick: Oh, come on, SpongeBob, don't leave me hanging here!
[SpongeBob panicking]
Patrick: Let me guess, it's time to start screaming again?
SpongeBob: Wait a second. [Takes picture] Okay now. [Both screaming and running]
[SpongeBob and Patrick fall, SpongeBob grabs onto a vine while Patrick grabs onto SpongeBob's legs]
Patrick: SpongeBob, as much as I'd like to stay and hang around, I'm not sure now's the time.
SpongeBob: I know Patrick, but now it seems to be- [Hands slip, SpongeBob starts hyperventilating] Our best possible course of action!
Patrick: [Sweating] Well, I'd probably be really enjoying the view if I still had some blood flowing in my arms. Ow!
[Vine starts to break]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick, your blood flows not the only thing that's wearing thin! [Vine breaks, both screaming and swinging on a vine. SpongeBob sees different vine] Grab it, Patrick!
Patrick: Grabbing! [SpongeBob gets sleepy] Okay SpongeBob, your turn! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [Snoring, wakes up and grabs vine] Oh, I got it!
[SpongeBob and Patrick slide through the sand, land behind a rock]
[Monster looks around, shrugs and flies away]
SpongeBob: Whew, that was a close one, right Patrick?
Patrick: Yeah, but it looks like everything worked out just... fine... [Patrick laughing]
[Ringing noise]
SpongeBob: Patrick... Patrick, did you hear that?
Patrick: It sounded like it came from the other side of this big rock!
SpongeBob: This isn't a big rock, it's a big wall!
[Camera zooms out to reveal ""no parking"" sign on brick wall]
Patrick: Do you think it belongs to that gift shop right there?
[Camera pans to gift shop]
SpongeBob: [Walks up to gift shop] What would a gift shop be doing right in the middle of nowhere?
Patrick: Uh... selling gifts?
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter gift shop]
SpongeBob: [Looking around] Wow Patrick, look at all this stuff! [Taking multiple pictures] You gonna buy something?
Patrick: No, I'm not in the market for any souvenirs.
SpongeBob: Oh, you could never have to many- [Gasps] Oh no! I just realized what this place is!
Patrick: You have?
SpongeBob: Patrick, we have walked straight into a [whispering] tourist trap.
Patrick: A trap!
SpongeBob: Shhh...
Patrick: [Whispering] A trap!
SpongeBob: [Sweating] Come on. Let's escape, before we spend all our money on useless trinkets.
[SpongeBob and Patrick tip-toeing out of gift shop]
SpongeBob: Patrick, wait, I saw a very nice driftwood sculpture over there that would work great as a mantelpiece.
Patrick: SpongeBob, no! [cries, as SpongeBob walks off-screen]
[Cuts to Patrick spelling his name in the sand, SpongeBob enters crying and carrying multiple shopping bags]
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Patrick, that tourist shop took me for everything I had! Now we don't have any money, we're still lost, and we're gonna be in big trouble! Oh, this vacation is a disaster!
Patrick: SpongeBob I-
[SpongeBob bursts into tears and speaks gibberish]
Patrick: I don't think this vacation has been a disaster.
SpongeBob: You don't?
Patrick: [Picks up brochure, opens] No! Of course not, see?! We did everything we dreamed of doing at The Great Barrier Reef.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're right! We went down a sewage pipe...
Patrick: Like a slide.
SpongeBob: Bounced off a huge anemone...
Patrick: Like a trampoline.
SpongeBob: Hid in a nest!
Patrick: Like a fort!
SpongeBob: And swung on some vines! Which are a lot like ropes! This vacation has it all!
Patrick: [Closes brochure] All except for one thing.
SpongeBob: What's that?
Patrick: A way out of here.
SpongeBob: My poor parents must be worried sick.
Patrick: I suggest we take a nap here until they come and find us! That way we'll be well-rested on the way home.
SpongeBob: [Walking away, Leaving his bags.] I suggest we start walking.
Patrick: I was afraid he was gonna suggest that.

Harold: Oh, hey, son, we're ready to go.

Patrick: Wow, SpongeBob, you're pretty good with that thing.
SpongeBob: Well, thanks, Patrick, glad you think so.
Patrick: Apparently I'm not the only one who does.
SpongeBob: What do you mean? Who else could- [Camera zooms out to reveal the monster] Oh no, not again

While talking to SpongeBob, he gets the idea to fake being sick to get away from him. He tells SpongeBob that he has a scratchy throat, a dry mouth, and an itchy eye. He dubs it as ""squid's disease"" and SpongeBob worries that he will catch it. He suggests Squidward to go home to get better. Squidward goes to Mr. Krabs to tell him he is sick, so Mr. Krabs checks him out. He concludes that Squidward is fine and healthy, and then tells him to get back to work.When SpongeBob prepares to deliver an order, Squidward notices him wearing a gas mask. Squidward sneezes into it, so SpongeBob panics. He goes to Mr. Krabs to tell him Squidward is sick, but Mr. Krabs is not convinced. He notices SpongeBob is acting odd, which is affecting business. He learns that it is because he thinks Squidward is ill and he is afraid to catch it. He then suggests Squidward ""make him scarce."" Squidward mirthfully leaves, and SpongeBob is relieved, until he notices his eye itches, his throat feels scratchy, and his mouth is dry. Using home remedies, SpongeBob soaks his feet in hot water, then freezing ice water, then boiling oil. He then smears hot mustard onto his fried legs to attempt to conceal the crisp, only for it to worsen his pain rather than healing it. He thinks about putting cucumbers on his wounded legs, but only sees pickles. Concluding pickles are like cucumbers, he dumps the pickles and their vinegar onto his legs. The vinegar burns his legs and he falls all over the place, into a pile of garbage. SpongeBob delivers an order while covered in garbage. The customers are turned off by the sickly employee and leave, prompting Mr. Krabs to tell SpongeBob to go home until he feels better. SpongeBob asks who will work while he is away, and Mr. Krabs boasts that he can do all the work blindfolded with one claw tied behind his back.Squidward lies on a beach chair, enjoying his break, when a garbage-covered SpongeBob comes along. Squidward is annoyed, and then goes into his house to at least enjoy himself inside. SpongeBob then goes in with him, and shows him a video tape with a romantic comedy on it, causing Squidward to immediately get angry at SpongeBob. At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is having a hard time fulfilling orders, and angers customers by throwing food at them and all over the place. Back at Squidward's home, the movie is over, but SpongeBob says there are 99 more sequels to watch next. Squidward cannot take it anymore and runs out of his house, screaming. SpongeBob follows him to the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs lies on the ground, covered with Krabby Patty pieces, woozily telling SpongeBob that he could take care of everything and that he might've caught the ""squid's disease."" Noticing that Mr. Krabs is not feeling good, SpongeBob presents him with the video tape of the romantic comedy. The episode ends with Mr. Krabs telling him to get that tape away from him and runs away from him.",Squiditis,"[Episode starts in a field with the clams flying. Squidward is shown to have two clouds with a rainbow over his head, bordered by many jellyfish.]
Squidward: [sighs] My, what a beautiful day it is outside. [scene switches to Krusty Krab] Too bad I'm cooped up here in the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Who are you talking to, Squidward?
Squidward: Just like I always seem to be on a nice sunny day.
SpongeBob: Look at it this way, Squidward: Things could always be worse.
Squidward: Worse? How?
SpongeBob: Well, uh...
[fish walks by and sneezes all over a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Uh...you could be sick.
Squidward: Sick? Is that really any worse?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Being sick is awful! The aches, the running nose, and the fever are bad enough. But that's not even the worst part.
Squidward: Oh, really.
SpongeBob: No. The worst part is missing a glorious shift here at the Krusty Krab.
[the words ""Krusty Krab"" echo in Squidward's head]
SpongeBob: Squidward? Squidward? Squidward!
Squidward: Huh? Oh, SpongeBob. I'm suddenly not feeling very well. [inadequately coughs]
SpongeBob: What's the matter?
Squidward: Well, Uh. Let's see. Uh. I got a scratchy throat and, uh, [sticks out his tongue] dry mouth, and my, um, uh, my eyes are itchy. [scratches his left eye vigorously]
SpongeBob: Squidward, what could it be?
Squidward: I'm not sure. But I fear I might be coming down with a dreaded illness.
SpongeBob: Ah! What is the name of this horrible illness?
Squidward: Name? Oh, uh. Per, swees, swer, squeer, uh, squid's disease.
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: Squid's disease.
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: Squid's disease!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward. I think the disease is affecting your temper.
Squidward: SpongeBob? SpongeBob. [camera pans to find SpongeBob hiding behind three pillows] What are you doing back there?
SpongeBob: I hate to be the bearer of bad news, Squidward, but I think the best thing for somebody in your condition would be to [gulps] go home and not come back until you're fully recovered.
Squidward: Well, SpongeBob, [stutters] I think you're probably right.
SpongeBob: [sniffles] I'm so sorry, Squidward.
Squidward: Well, I, I better go break the news to Mr. Krabs. [inadequately coughs again]
Mr. Krabs: You're sick?!
Squidward: [inadequately coughs]
Mr. Krabs: Well you don't look any sicker than you usually do. [Squidward frowns] You know what. I better give you the old navy onceover just to be sure.
Squidward: The what?
[Mr. Krabs lifts Squidward's nose]
Mr. Krabs: Now open wide.
[Squidward opens his mouth]
Mr. Krabs: [pulls out Squidward's tongue] Tongue looks fine. [lets it go, opens Squidward's left eyelid] Eyes, check. [knocks on Squidward's forehead]
Squidward: Ow!
Mr. Krabs: Forehead feels normal. [lifts two of Squidward's legs] Now let's see those kneecaps. [hits kneecaps, causing Squidward's legs to slowly bend upward and then back downward] Reflexes are a little slow. But I'd expect that from you.
Squidward: Wonderful.
Mr. Krabs: Well, Mr. Squidward, in my expert opinion, you look fit as a fiddle.
Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: [slams his fist on his desk] Mr. Krabs nothing.
Squidward: But I...
Mr. Krabs: [slams his fist on his desk again] Mr. Krabs nothing!
Squidward: But, but…
Mr. Krabs: [slams his fist on his desk one last time] Mr. Krabs nothing! Just go ahead, I'm gonna keep saying it.
Squidward: And what about the customers? You don't want them to get sick, do you?
Mr. Krabs: No. And I don't want them to get hungry either. [pushes Squidward out of his office] So step to it, Mr. Squidward. Oh yeah, and get well soon. [laughs and shuts the door]
Squidward: [sighs. Fishes speak among each other in the cash register line.]
Squidward: [takes a bill from fish] SpongeBob, would you bring that order to table 3, puh-lease?
SpongeBob: [muffled] Right away, Squidward.
Squidward: SpongeBob. [SpongeBob halts] Turn around, please.
SpongeBob: [turns around and appears to be wearing a gas mask] Yes. [heavy breathing]
Squidward: And just what is that supposed to be?
SpongeBob: Oh this, it's a number 2: Krabby Patty with cheese, medium drink...
Squidward: Not that. Not that. The thing on your face.
SpongeBob: [points to his gas mask] Oh, this.
Squidward: Yes.
SpongeBob: Oh, this is a precautionary measure in case should anyone in the workplace happens to fall ill, which in this case you have. Then I wear it to protect my body from spreading germs and bacterias.
Squidward: [appears in front of SpongeBob, and lets out a breath, stretching his words] Hi SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hello Squidward.
Squidward: Could I see that?
SpongeBob: Um actually no.
Squidward: Because I find this all so very inte... [sneezes into his nose of his mask] ...resting.
[SpongeBob takes off mask, screams, and runs into Mr. Krabs' office]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Neptune's Knee-highs, lad! How many times do I have to remind you to knock?!
SpongeBob: [knocks on the door while speaking] Mis...ter...Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: That's better. Now what can I do you for?
SpongeBob: It's Squidward. He's sick.
Mr. Krabs: That's funny. You're the second person today whose told me that.
SpongeBob: Who was the first?
Mr. Krabs: Squidward. But I checked out that slimy green cashier personally, and if he's sick, then I'm the next mayor of Marmalade Mountain. [lowers his voice and ponders] Doesn't sound like a bad gig actually.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, you have to believe me. Squidward's got a horrible disease called Squid's Disease! Scratchy throat, itchy eyes, dry mouth, fevers, and boils, and missed workdays! [panics and falls to the floor]
Fish: One Krabby Patty, please.
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, got a minute?
Squidward: Oh of course. It's not like I'm busy working or anything.
Mr. Krabs: [leans in] We've got a situation with the kid. Something's got him spooked.
[SpongeBob is shown holding his nose and mouth tightly]
Mr. Krabs: He can't cook in this condition. No cookin, no patties. No patties, no money.
Squidward: And you're telling me this, why?
Mr. Krabs: I need you to make yourself scarce for a while.
Squidward: So, you're telling me to go home?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't care where you go, just as long as you get outta here!
Squidward: Yippee! Thanks, Mr. Krabs! I mean [inadequately coughs]
SpongeBob: Poor Squidward.
[in the kitchen]
SpongeBob: My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is... [scratches his right eye] My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is... [scratches his eye once again] That's funny. My eyes feel itchy. [pauses, coughs] And my throat feels scratchy, too. [laughs, drops spatula worriedly] Itchy eyes, scratchy throat... [rubs his tongue only for smoke to come off and gasps, hoarsely] Even my mouth feels dry! [normal] I've contracted... Squid's Disease! [yells]
Mr. Krabs: [barges into the kitchen] SpongeBob, everything all right in here?
SpongeBob: Everything's fine, captain. Just a little, uh, howl for pleasure.
Mr. Krabs: Well, how about a little less pleasure and a little more work? [shuts the door]
SpongeBob: [to himself] If Mr. Krabs finds out I have the Squid's Disease, he'll send me home, just like Squidward. Wait a second! That's it! Why go home when I have Grandma's down home folk remedies right here? [fills a pot with water] Grandma always said: 'If you might be coming down with an illness, just stick your feet in hot water.' [places his feet into the water] Or was it cold water? [places his feet into the ice and shivers] Something tells me it wasn't that either. Of course! It wasn't hot water or cold water. It was boiling oil. [places his feet into fryer] Uh-huh. I can definitely feel the medicinal qualities. [takes his feet out, fried to a crisp] Oh no!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You sure everything's alright?
SpongeBob: [places his feet and legs back into the boiling oil] Yes, everything's fine in here. [Mr. Krabs shuts the door] Just dandy. [takes his feet and legs back out] I better conceal these unsightly blemishes or Mr. Krabs will get suspicious. [smears liquid onto his right leg] This super hot spicy yellow mustard will do the trick. Oh no, actually that burns real bad. [worriedly] Stay calm. Just need to cool it off. Cucumber. Cucumber will cool it off. We'll just need to find some— [holds up a pickle jar] pickles. Pickles are like cucumbers. Sweet relief, here I come. [pours all the juice and the pickles onto his legs, sigh of relief turns into loud screams of pain] Sweet vinegar, it burns! It burns! It burns! [crashes into a trash bin and a mop. Rolls into more trash bins. Customers listen to that racket]
Frankie Billy: Do you guys hear what's going on?
Harold: Yes, and I'm very puzzled.
Nat Peterson: So am I, in fact, I might even be a little concerned.
Harold: Well, I don't know if I'd go that far.
[SpongeBob comes out of kitchen with trash covering him; crawls in front of Frankie Billy, Harold, and Nat Peterson and then lies on side]
SpongeBob: Sorry, I think I might be coming down with something.
Harold: Coming down with something?
Nat: I refuse to be served by a sick fry cook.
Harold: Me too. Let's get outta here!
Frankie Billy: Good idea!
[fish banter while two other fish march out of restaurant]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Me customers! [looks at SpongeBob lying on back now and gasps] You look terrible.
SpongeBob: Thank you, Mr. Krabs. [coughs]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can't just stand by while me restaurant becomes a breeding ground for infection. SpongeBob, go home. That's an order!
SpongeBob: But who's going to run the restaurant?
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Who's gonna run it? I could run this place blindfolded with one claw tied behind me back. I'll show ya.
[scene cuts to Squidward's house]
Squidward: [appears to be resting on a chair with the radio on.] [sighs] Who thought that having an illness could feel so good? [drinks beverage]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. [Squidward spits out drinks]
Squidward: Oh, no! What happened to you?
SpongeBob: I... fell ill. Mr. Krabs won't let me work again until I'm better. Well, at least we can spend the day recovering together. After all, misery loves company. Right, Squidward? [coughs. Squidward appears to have disappeared] Squidward?
[inside Squidward's house]
Squidward: Well, so much for enjoying the great outdoors. But at least I can relax and enjoy… [sighs] some afternoon tea.
SpongeBob: That sounds like a great idea, Squidward!
Squidward: [drops tea and screams] SpongeBob, what have I told you about coming into my house?
SpongeBob: I figured I can't make you well, Squidward, but I can at least make you comfortable. I brought hot compresses, tissues, the good kind with snail butter, and even a romantic comedy for us to watch. I know they're supposed to be funny, but they always make me cry.
[in the Krusty Krab, the customers are in a riot]
Mr. Krabs: 25 Krabby Patties! [leaps into kitchen and sprints out with Krabby Patties. Throws food randomly] Order up! Order up! Order up!
Thaddeus: Hey I didn't order a table patty! [Krabby Patty appears to be splattered on table]
Shubie: Yeah or a window patty!
Fish 3: Or a face patty, I want a refund!
[fish start riot yelling refund. In Squidward's house]
Television: Female: I love you Ted. Male: Ditto. [both engage in laughing]
SpongeBob: [seen crying and blows into tissue] Wasn't that great, Squidward?
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh, yeah, howdy. That's too bad it had to end. Finally.
SpongeBob: Oh don't worry, we have all 99 sequels to watch next.
Squidward: Oh would you look at that. I'm suddenly feeling much, much better. I think I'm going back to work now, bye. [rushes out his house and back to work being followed by SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward, wait! Squidward! You're not well enough to return to work! I can't let you.
Squidward: Please just stop! Stop following me.
SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!
SpongeBob and Squidward: [both gasp] Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [appears to be lying on ground with mustard and buns covering him] I told you. I could run this place all by myself. Blindfolded with one claw tied behind me back.
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here lying on the floor?
Mr. Krabs: Well, SpongeBob, funny you should ask. Because in me expert medical opinion, I think I may be coming down with a nasty case of Squid's Disease.
SpongeBob: Squid's Disease? I know just the cure! [holds up romantic comedy tape]
Mr. Krabs: Romantic Comedy?! No! [crawls away] Ahh! Get that thing away from me!",2.27,"Aaron Springer,Derek Iversen"

Mr. Hillbilly (Instrumental),Jellyfish Jam,Lonely on the Beach,Stadium Rave A","10 minutes, 49 seconds",1,"A jellyfish insists on following SpongeBob home after a day out at Jellyfish Fields, so SpongeBob decides on keeping it as a pet at his home. Squidward warns SpongeBob that jellyfish are wild animals and that he should not attempt to domesticate it, but SpongeBob completely ignores him. At home, SpongeBob dances with the jellyfish to loud techno rave music, which annoys Squidward to no end. After 12 hours of this form of nonstop partying, SpongeBob finally decides that it is time to go to bed, but this jellyfish does not want to stop. SpongeBob eventually forces it to go to bed by tying a leash around it and ties it to his bed. Gary tries to tell SpongeBob he should not be keeping a wild animal, but SpongeBob does not listen. During the night, while SpongeBob sleeps, the jellyfish escapes and many other jellyfish come over whom he invites into the house.The next morning, SpongeBob wakes up to find his living room filled with dozens of dancing jellyfish. He attempts to make them leave, but to no avail. Squidward, annoyed that the music has been going on for 18 hours and prevented him from sleeping, angrily calls SpongeBob on his conch phone to tell him that he has had enough of the loud music. A jellyfish picks it up and sprays him with jelly over the phone. Irritated, Squidward decides that ""two can play at this,"" and starts loudly playing his clarinet, angering the jellyfish with his terrible playing, and causing them to start destroying SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob asks Squidward to play his clarinet a little ""better,"" as an insulted Squidward sarcastically responds to this request. However, Squidward intentionally starts playing even worse and much louder with speakers and a microphone. This prompts the jellyfish to angrily go to his house, as he cowardly tries to promise to stop playing, but they sting him before returning to SpongeBob's house. A sting-covered Squidward says to SpongeBob, ""Everybody's a critic. You won't be hearing from me anymore,"" and gives him his clarinet before leaving. The jellyfish hastily take it from SpongeBob, break it in half, set it on fire, and dance around it.This brings SpongeBob to the limits of his patience, and he attempts to remove the stereo system to make the jellyfish leave. However, the jellyfish attempt to bring it back to continue their party. In the ensuing struggle, both SpongeBob and the jellyfish end up accidentally dropping the stereo to the floor, destroying it instantly. The enraged jellyfish begin stinging and chasing him. SpongeBob and Gary go up to the roof of the house, but the swarm follows them outside and surrounds them. SpongeBob tells Gary that he was right about attempting to keep a wild animal in his house, then Gary soothes the jellyfish away by clicking his eyes together. SpongeBob tells Gary to keep doing this and puts him on his head, walking downstairs and out the front door, followed by the swarm. As he leads them back to Jellyfish Fields, more sounds accompany Gary's clicking, eventually becoming a full-fledged symphony. After resettling the jellyfish, SpongeBob quickly returns home with Gary.In the last scene, SpongeBob shakes hands with Gary's eyeball as the French narrator declares, ""Today, SpongeBob has learned one of the sea’s harshest lessons; wild animals can throw very wild parties."" Then the severely stung Squidward is shown settling into his bathtub to recover from his stings, which the French narrator reacts ""Oh, I felt that.""",Jellyfish Jam,"[The episode begins at Jellyfish Fields. Some jellyfish are floating around.]
French Narrator: Ah, Jellyfish Fields. Here we find SpongeBob once again stalking the wild jellyfish. SpongeBob? Allô? SpongeBob? Hmmm... he's supposed to be here somewhere... [narrator looks around and sees a square-shaped coral] A-ha! [a jellyfish floats by. SpongeBob puts his glasses on]
SpongeBob: [to the viewers] Safety first. [slides to a jellyfish and captures it] A-ha! I finally gotcha! [grabs a wooden stool and sits on it. He then puts on a farmer hat and ""milks"" the jellyfish. Jelly comes out and squirts on a piece of bread. The jellyfish moos like a cow. He eats and starts speaking like the French Narrator] Ah, there is nothing better than the taste of natural jelly from a jellyfish. [normal voice] See you later! [walks off but jellyfish floats towards him with his glasses] Oh? Oh, my glasses! Thanks, little guy! Bye! [the jellyfish floats with SpongeBob] I can't play anymore, jellyfish. I got to get home. [the jellyfish hangs onto SpongeBob's nose] No. You can't go home with me. [the jellyfish walks behind him. The jellyfish's steps are squeaking, like SpongeBob's] Jellyfish, you've got to stay here! [the jellyfish floats towards SpongeBob] Hey! [puts the jellyfish on a rock] Stay! [walks backwards] Stay... [the jellyfish floats around SpongeBob. SpongeBob grabs the jellyfish and uses a slingshot to launch him somewhere else but the jellyfish ends up on his back. The jellyfish giggles. SpongeBob pulls the jellyfish off] [exasperated] Jellyfish! For the last time, you cannot come home with me! [looks at the jellyfish sternly. The jellyfish deflates as if he was sad. SpongeBob decides to keep him] Ahh, what the heck! [SpongeBob, with the jellyfish on a rope, like a dog, walk by Squidward's house] Squidward! Hey, Squidward! Squidward! Squidwardiard! [Squidward peeks out his window] Squidward! Look at my new pet!
Squidward: That's no pet, that's a wild animal.
SpongeBob: No he isn't! Watch this! Fetch! [throws a stick so the jellyfish returns it. SpongeBob is holding up three fingers] How many fingers am I holding up? [the jellyfish hums deeply three times] Play dead! [jellyfish is buried underground with a tomb that says ""R.I.P."" He pops up]
Squidward: I wouldn't let that thing into my house even if it was potty-trained! [the jellyfish, still on the rope, is on a toilet reading a newspaper as he hums to the tune of ""Hello Blues"" casually] I didn't need to see that.
SpongeBob: Well, we're going to my house to have a little fun.
Squidward: How can you possibly have fun with a jellyfish? [SpongeBob and the jellyfish dance to Stadium Rave A. Also, various colors change as they dance. Disco lights rotate around the room. SpongeBob's house is vibrating from the music] SpongeBob is the only guy I know who can have fun with a jellyfish... for 12 hours!
SpongeBob: [stops dancing. He is exhausted, sees the jellyfish dance more] Whew! Wow, you sure like to dance. Well, that's enough for tonight. [turns the music off] It's time to go to bed. [as he walks off, the jellyfish turns the music back on] Huh? [walks over to turn the music off] You got it all wrong, little fella. [the jellyfish turns the music back on. SpongeBob turns it back off] Bed. Repeat after me. [SpongeBob ties the rope around the jellyfish] Bed! [the jellyfish reaches for the stereo but SpongeBob pulls it off. Upstairs, SpongeBob ties the rope around his bedpost] We'll just keep you right here.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Quit worrying, Gary. He'll be just fine. Good night, everybody. [as he is sleeping throughout the night, other jellyfish float inside the pineapple]
Gary: [wakes up] Meow. [jellyfish opens the window, and the 4 jellyfish talking in jellyfish speaking. Gary gets angry] Meow. [gets squirted with jelly from all the jellyfish, they laugh at Gary, and continue squirting jelly on him] Meow. [More jellyfish enter SpongeBob's House. It's now daytime and the rooster crows everyone up]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Gary. Good morning, jellyfish. Jellyfish? Jellyfish? Here, jellyfish. Oh, jelly! [puts on his green robe and goes to check downstairs]
Gary: [Follows SpongeBob to the doorway, while completely filled with jelly.] Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, jellyfi-! [slips on some jelly. Opens a door leading into his living room and sees jellyfish dancing to music. The jellyfish are having a dance party.] Where'd you all come from? [jellyfish form a figure of a hand and the hand grabs SpongeBob. They stick over a light bulb like a disco ball and spin him. Then falls to the ground] Okay, that's it. Party is over! You guys have overstayed your welcome. [As SpongeBob is walking to the stereo, jellyfish form a flight of stairs that SpongeBob walks up and but does not notice] This music is way too loud. [He screams as he falls down. Jellyfish carry SpongeBob in a triangle] Very funny. [jellyfish carry SpongeBob in a rectangle] I'm serious!
[Jellyfish carry SpongeBob up and down the screen. The scene then goes to SpongeBob's house bouncing up and down because of the loud party. Scene cuts to Squidward's house. Squidward is still lying in his bed, holding a pillow against his face. He has not slept all night.]
Squidward: Grr! 18 hours! [falls off his bed, picks up the phone and dials SpongeBob's number] I'm gonna give that SpongeBob a piece of my mind!
Jellyfish: [Cut back to the party. The phone rings and a jellyfish picks it up and he is garbled] Hello?
Squidward: SpongeBob, listen to me, you square-headed assault on my ears! I've had enough of this! [Jelly squirts through the phone and onto Squidward's face] Strawberry. [Squidward plays his clarinet outside his window] Two can play at this! [plays ""Row Row Row Your Boat"" with his clarinet badly. Jellyfish form a smiley face.]
SpongeBob: Come on, guys, enough is enough! [hears the clarinet music in the distance.] Huh? [Cuts back to the Jellyfish's smile but this time, it turns into an angry frown when Squidward plays his clarinet] Uh-oh! [Jellyfish sting him] Hey, take it easy! Ow! Okay, I'll talk to him! [peeks his head out his window] Squidward! Would it be possible to play your clarinet a little... better? I don't think the jellyfish like it.
Squidward: The jellyfish don't like...? [sarcastically] Why, sure, pal, I can play better.
SpongeBob: Okay, he said he'll play better.
[Squidward's house rotates slowly towards SpongeBob's house. He has a giant amp set behind him. In front of him is a microphone. Squidward inhales deeply as his house stretches, then he plays ""Row Row Row Your Boat"" more unpleasantly with his clarinet again, but extremely loud.]
SpongeBob: Uh-oh! That's not better! [Jellyfish knocks his coral plant over] Hey! Take it easy with that! [The jellyfish knock over his television] Those are my things! [The jellyfish knock over a wall decoration then they push him] Don't break th- Dow! [The jellyfish float out of the party and into Squidward's house]
Squidward: Uh, wait, I can turn it down. Ow! Ow! Ow! [The angry jellyfish sting him and float back into SpongeBob's house, returning to their party. He is welt-covered then walks up to the door and gives SpongeBob his clarinet.] Everybody's a critic. You won't be hearing from me anymore. [hands SpongeBob his clarinet]
SpongeBob: Hey, now, that wasn't nice! [jellyfish take the clarinet and snap it in half. A fire forms and they dance around it in a circle. Boat horn toots as SpongeBob finally reaches his breaking point, shouting] Okay, that is it! Everybody out!
[SpongeBob grabs the stereo and runs toward the door but the jellyfish try to take it back so they can party more. Both sides accidentally let go and the stereo falls to floor and shatters into pieces with a crash causing the music to stop. SpongeBob gulps and the jellyfish start to quiver, due to the loss of the music, thus ending their party. SpongeBob stammers. The jellyfish get enraged and sting SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Come on, Gary! [SpongeBob and Gary head up to the roof. SpongeBob's house vibrates forcefully, and the jellyfish start to swarm around the house.] Gary, you were right. Thanks for not rubbing it in. [SpongeBob looks scared and his teeth chatter. Gary clicks his eyes together making a beat that the jellyfish can dance to.] Huh? They stopped? [holds Gary's eyes together and the jellyfish get enraged again. Then he lets go of Gary's eyes and they dance again. Does this a couple more times and notices a trend.] Gary! Don't... stop... shaking it!
[SpongeBob takes Gary to Jellyfish Fields, the jellyfish following him behind in a line. Along the way, SpongeBob has other creatures and things join in the rhythm, first bubbles popping, a chest opening and releasing bubbles on the first beat, an anchor chain making tambourine noises, a dolphin chirping every fourth beat, a trio of anemones making synthesizer noises, a line of singing clamshells, jellyfish playing a harp, and soon a lively melody is playing. Eventually, he gets the jellyfish back home to Jellyfish Fields and he runs back to his home.]
French Narrator: Today, SpongeBob has learned one of the sea's harshest lessons: Wild animals can throw very wild parties.
[SpongeBob shakes Gary's eye, congratulating him. Meanwhile, Squidward sinks down into his bubble bath as he groans in pain.]

Plankton comes in on a rocket to steal the patty, with Krabs dismissively shutting him in, locking him into it for around 2000 years. Nobody notices that Plankton is trapped inside, except Karen, who ignores him.About 2000 years later, the time capsule re-emerges and opens up.

French Narrator: [narrating time card] 2,000 ish years later...
[The clock on the time capsule beeps as it now reads ""0000."" The time capsule rises back up and opens its hatch, also releasing its contents and SpongeBob's laugh gas.]
Plankton: [emerging from the pile] At last, [holding a singular patty molecule] after surviving on this patty one molecule at a time, I've finally cracked the secret formula. [insane laughter] Now my reign of terror can be--wait a minute.
[Bikini Bottom is now entirely covered in chrome, and there are now flying cars.]
Plankton: [hops down, walking around] This dump looks less dumpy. [looking at his reflection on a building] The future must be pretty great if everything's made of chrome, [pulls out a pair of socks] and slidey. [puts on the socks and starts sliding around on the ground] Whoo-hoo! Hey-ee. Mm, pretty. Ooh. [sees a building called ""Chrome Bucket"" in place of the Chum Bucket] What? The Chrome Bucket? Whoa. [runs into the building and pulls himself off] Where's the door? I can't take over the world if I can't even [jumps] get into my lab. [knocking] Karen, let me in!
Future Karen: [phases through the Chrome Bucket as a chrome orb] Sheldon, welcome home.
Plankton: Karen, is that you? I see you've had some work done.
Future Karen: Uh-huh. And that's not the only work I've been doing.
Plankton: Ooh. [rubbing hands] Have you completed some kind of deadly destructive robot?
Future Karen: Negative. [displays an easel] I have been working on my art pieces. [sprays a gray background with two squiggly lines] I'm quite successful, in fact.
[A couple appears.]
Wife: Oh, honey, [pointing] this would match the couch in the living room.
Husband: We'll [holds up chrome money] take it.
Future Karen: [takes the money, then the couple walk off with the painting]
Plankton: [shrugging] Who cares about art? [walks] Time to help me take over the world. Now, what happened to the front door? [waves arm] Ah, never mind. [uses a blowtorch on the Chrome Bucket while wearing a welding mask]
Future Karen: You don't understand, Plankton. The whole world is different now.
Plankton: [stops welding, lifts mask] Wait, what do you mean?
Future Karen: Let me show you. [uses a beam of light to pick up Plankton]
Plankton: Whoa!
Future Karen: [showing Plankton a Museum of Squidward, where people are lined up to see his house] See? This is Squidward's old house.
Plankton: Huh? Museum of Squidward? Who would ever go to a museum dedicated to that loser?
Future Karen: Lots of people. [Squidward's clarinet playing is heard as the guard lets someone in] Squidward's old clarinet recordings are considered classical music now.
Plankton: Wow. They weren't considered music at all before.
Future Karen: [approacing a chrome sculpture of Squidward's head] Sadly, no one started listening to them until the day after he was gone.
Squidward sculpture: Typical.
[Future Karen turns around with Plankton. Chrome bubble transition to Future Karen and Plankton arriving at Patrick's chrome rock.]
Future Karen: This is what Patrick's rock looks like [lets Plankton to the ground] now.
Plankton: [faceplams] Ugh. [pointing] That moron was always an idiot. [Patrick's soda cup is seen attached to his butt] And his stupid soda cup left me sticky for [rips off the cup to reveal his bare rear end, raises fist] 2,000 years. [Patrick's rock slowly forms into a figure resembling Patrick] If he were here right now, I'd sock him right in his slack jaw. [notices Patrick] Eh--
Future Karen: [off-screen] And this is the P-1000.
P-1000: [eyes turn red] I'm hungry. I need a chrome snack. [scratches torso]
Plankton: Even as a robot he's an idiot.
P-1000: [head forms into vacuum to suck up Plankton] Food!
Plankton: [gets sucked up] Whoa!
P-1000: [eats Plankton and spits him out onto Future Karen] Ew! This doesn't taste like chrome. I'm going back to bed. [reforms into a chrome bed]
Plankton: [groans and falls to the ground, then gets up, wiping hands] Now let me guess--next, you're going to show me what happened to SpongeBob.
Future Karen: I wasn't, but if [carries Plankton over to Future SpongeBob's house] you insist. [uses Plankton to knock on the door]
Future SpongeBob hologram: [wearing future shades and outfit; door raises, pointing] Hey, cats. How's it hanging? Thanks for stopping by, ya dig?
Plankton: Wow, SpongeBob. I can't believe something here has actually improved, and that something was you.
Future Karen: It's not SpongeBob. It's his holographic doorman.
Plankton: [puts his hand through the hologram to see it is a hologram]
Future SpongeBob: [a glass cube with a mouth on a wheel, laughing]
Future Karen: This is the real SpongeBob, or at least what he's left of him.
Future SpongeBob: [laughing]
Future Karen: Aww, he likes you.
Plankton: [screams, covering ears] Make it stop! I was haunted by the echoes of that laugh for 2,000 years. [falls down and gets chased by Future SpongeBob, screaming]
Future SpongeBob] [laughing]
Plankton: [tosses chrome coral to trip Future SpongeBob]
Future SpongeBob: Whoops! [trips on the coral and falls over]
Plankton: [stops and looks back] Huh?
Future SpongeBob: [spinning while laughing on the ground, then begins making ""voop"" noises, then continues laughing again as Plankton runs away back to Future Karen]
Plankton: Okay, I get it. The future is awful. But I know the secret [grabs Future Karen] formula now. We can take over [waving fist in the air] this horrible timeline.
Future Karen: Um, about that. I think there's something else you should see.
[Cut to Future Karen showing Plankton ""The Kromey Krab,"" which displays a closed message with wooden boards.]
Plankton: The Kromey Krab? [drops to the ground] ""Permanently closed due to rust."" This is great news!
Future Karen: Ah, not exactly. [cut to her showing Plankton the chrome town] It doesn't matter if the Krusty Krab is open or not. [two fish synthesize Krabby Patties with the bulb on their heads] In the future, everyone knows the secret formula.
Fish: [both take a bite into their patties]
Plankton: They what? [holds arms to head, screams] No! [slumps] That's it! I've had it with the future! I just want to go back to all the people I hate. [crosses arms]
Future Karen: Oh, why didn't you say so? I know someone who might be able to help.
[Future Karen carries Plankton over to Sandy's treedome's entrance.]
Plankton: [falls to the ground facefirst, then gets up] The screwy squirrel? Really?
Future Karen: The squirrel didn't get trapped in a tube for 2,000 years, did she?
Plankton: Touché, I guess. This is weird. Sandy's place looks exactly the same.
Future Karen: Indeed, but be warned. Sandy may not be exactly how you remember her.
Plankton: [scared] Uh-- [knocks on the entrance door, then jumps upon hearing Future Sandy]
Future Sandy: [off-screen] Who dares to knock upon [entrance door opens] my dome?
Plankton: [gulps and enters the treedome with a water helmet, looking around] Hello? Sandy? Are you in there?
Kamp Koral Sandy: [grunts, then jumps into Plankton's view] Hey!
Plankton: [screams]
Kamp Koral Sandy: [salutes] Sandy Cheeks at your service, Mr. Plankton.
Plankton: What the-- how did you get younger?
Kamp Koral Sandy: Oh, I've just been jumping through the ages since summer ended at Kamp Koral.
Plankton: Oh, just exploring space and time, huh? [fakes looking delighted] How wonderful. [jumps up to Kamp Koral Sandy's feet, begging] Please take me back to the present, please! [puts face to ground] I hate the future. I hate it!
Kamp Koral Sandy: [giggles, holds out a remote] No need to beg, Mr. Planton. I've been expecting you. Time time hopper's all gassed up.
Plankton: [jumps] Well, where is it?
Kamp Koral Sandy: You're standing in it, partner. This here treedome [camera zooms out] is my reverse time capsule.
Plankton: Then what are we waiting for? Away we go!
Kamp Koral Sandy: [presses the button on her remote, and the treedome begins vibrating]
Plankton: [waving] So long, Karen! See you 2,000 years ago. [the treedome and everything in it disappears]
Future Karen: You can come out now, Plankton 2.0. [a much larger and muscular version of Plankton with hair emerges from a rock]
Plankton 2.0: I thought he'd never leave. Now lay some [holds Future Karen] chrome on me, baby. [kissing Future Karen]
Future Karen: [purrs, giggles]
[Cut back in time to the Chum Bucket, where Sandy's treedome reappears nearby. The entrance door opens as Plankton and Kamp Koral Sandy walk out.]
Plankton: [kisses the ground, then grabs some sand] I never thought I'd say this, but I missed this horrible place. Oh, and thank you for your help or whatever. [waves hand] Be gone now.
Kamp Koral Sandy: Ain't you forgettin' somethin'?
Plankton: [turns around] All right, all right. [pulls a dollar out from his wallet and gives it to Kamp Koral Sandy] Can you break a single?
Kamp Koral Sandy: [giggles] I don't need a [pushes dollar away] tip, but I will need you to forget the secret formula. [pulls out a piece of pipe] Hold still while I activate my memory-erasin' device.
Plankton: Your what?
Kamp Koral Sandy: [hits Plankton with the pipe, making him faceplant; runs back inside the treedome, waving] See you back at camp, Mr. Plankton. [door shuts, treedome disappears]
Plankton: [gets up and groans, walks] What happened? [walking on the road] How did I get here? [groans, rubs eye] Huh? Aha!
[The same scene seen earlier in the episode of Mr. Krabs putting the patty in the time capsule is seen.]
Mr. Krabs: Customers of the future will pay top dollar for a vintage original Krabby Patty. [places patty in capsule]
Plankton: A Krabby Patty! Ho-ho-ho! [pulls out a remote and presses the button to summon a rocket] Now's my chance. Not so fast! [jumps into the capsule]
Crowd: [gasps]
Plankton: [cackles, points] You fools! Huh? Is anyone else having déjà vu?
Mr. Krabs: See you in 2,000-ish [shuts time capsule hatch] years, Plankton. [laughs]
Time capsule: [displaying ""2000 YEARS""] 2,000 years.

He then mopes about the activities he hasn't done, like his unfinished painting, his symphony, and his fresh strudel, which Patrick gobbles up. Squidward then ultimately decides that instead of going to work, he will stay home and ""dive into an ocean of Squidward.""He then calls Mr. Krabs and lies about being sick, but the latter is not fooled. He then goes over to Squidward's house and has SpongeBob take care of him until he is better, much to Squidward's dismay. Squidward tries to relax by finishing his painting, playing his clarinet, and eating his strudel, but SpongeBob constantly annoys him in an attempt to treat his disease.SpongeBob later checks Squidward's temperature, only to find that it is normal. SpongeBob then concludes that Squidward is better now and they can go back to work, but Squidward tricks SpongeBob by sticking the thermometer into the oven, making it break. SpongeBob then gets a bunch of ice from the mountains to cool Squidward down.SpongeBob then realizes that he has been treating the symptoms instead of the disease. Squidward then claims he has ""acute spotting sclorboritis,"" but he realizes it is actually real when SpongeBob finds it in a book. When Squidward sees the way it is treated, he then says it is actually ""Plerkington's syndrome,"" which SpongeBob ""cures"" by using leeches to suck Squidward's blood, jellyfish to electrocute Squidward, and using a rake to clear the leaves in Squidward's lungs.Mr. Krabs later calls to check on Squidward, to which the latter claims he is all better and begs the former to let him come to work. However, thinking that Squidward still needs to learn his lesson, Mr. Krabs pretends that Squidward is still very sick and tells SpongeBob to step up the cure. SpongeBob then seizes a sea urchin on Squidward.The day after at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob describes all the things he did to Squidward and Mr. Krabs laughs. Squidward arrives in bandages, but takes them off to unveil the Handsome Squidward, which Mr. Krabs faints at. Handsome Squidward says that SpongeBob cured his illnesses and goes to the register. Unfortunately, the customers begin yelling at Squidward for him to take their orders and SpongeBob begins annoying him again. Squidward then loses his hair and begins going back to his normal self and melts down, claiming he is going to be sick, as the episode ends.",Squidward's Sick Daze,"[The episode begins with a shot of the exterior of the Krusty Krab on a rainy day. A drop of rain falls through a visible hole on the roof, and falls on Dream Squidward's head.]
Dream Squidward: Hey!
[The camera zooms out to show a bunch of dream angry customers.]
Dream customer #1: What's taking so long?
Dream customer #2: I never got my fries!
Dream Fred: [popping out from the ceiling] Why doesn't my father love me?
Dream customer #3: Come on! Why are you so slow?
Dream SpongeBob: [putting his spatula on Dream Squidward] Hey, Squidward.
Dream Squidward: Quit it.
Dream SpongeBob: [putting his spatula on Dream Squidward again] Hey, Squidward.
Dream Squidward: Quit it.
Dream SpongeBob: [putting his foot on Dream Squidward] Hey, Squidward.
Dream Squidward: [shouting] Quit it!
Dream Mr. Krabs: [toilet flushes] Mr. Squidward, clean up in the head!
Dream Squidward: [eye twitches; groaning]

Dream Mr. Krabs: [spills soda, which turns into a flood] Also, clean up here!

Dream customers: Squidward!
Dream SpongeBob: [putting his spatula on Dream Squidward repeatedly] [off-screen] Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward, Hey, Squidward.
Dream Squidward: [his head falls onto the floor] Oh, no.
Dream Mr. Krabs: Don't just lay there. Clean up! Clean up! Clean up!
[Dream Squidward's head is on the floor and screams in fear]
Squidward: [screaming as he wakes up from his dream] It was just a dream. Just a horrible, realistic, totally on point dream. [walks into his art room] Oh, I can't believe I'm dreaming about work when there's so many more interesting things I could be doing. Just look at my unfinished painting. And my unfinished symphony. [a music note falls from the paper] And my uneaten strudel.
Patrick: [eats the strudel]
Squidward: [takes the strudel away] My strudel!
Patrick: Uh, just tasted like pie to me.
Squidward: It's a strudel, you barbarian. [flips through the strudel's layers] Just look at those pastry layers.
Patrick: [sucks up the pastry layers, and spits food into Squidward's face as he talks] Oh, yeah!
Squidward: Ohh... I just woke up and the day's already a disaster. I can't face the Krusty Krab today. I am staying home and diving into an ocean of Squidward.
[Squidward has a dream sequence of a waterfall, where he dives, quickly paints a masterpiece of himself, plays some clarinet notes, eats one of the Bon Bons from a food table, which slips off his tentacle hand and makes him shrug, and relaxes with the water pouring on him; when he wakes up, he finds Patrick drooling on him.]
Squidward: What the? [wipes the drool off of his face]
Patrick: Any more of that layer pie?
Squidward: Get out! [Patrick falls] Now, to get rid of the other monkey on my back. [Monkey screeching sounds are heard.] [fakes coughing and calls Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: [answers the phone] Krusty Krab?
Squidward: [fakes coughing and pretends to be sick] Oh, Mr. Krabs, it's... [fakes coughing again] Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, what are you doing on the phone? You should be working.
Squidward: [fakes coughing] I can't work. Too... [fakes coughing again] sick. [fakes sneezing, spreading the germs to Mr. Krabs over the phone]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, you do sound pretty bad. You sure you're too sick to work?
Squidward: [giggling while painting] I mean, I mean... [fakes coughing] positive.
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm. [grunts and sneaks his eye through the phone to peek on what Squidward is doing] Mmm, too sick, eh? Oh, I've got the cure for what ails ya. Well, you just rest up, Mr. Squidward. I'll take care of everything.
Squidward: Okay, bye, talk to ya-- I mean, I mean, uh... [fakes coughing and spits out the phlegm to one of Mr. Krabs' eyes] Bye! [hangs up phone]
Mr. Krabs: [hangs up phone] No one fakes sick on Mr. Krabs and gets away with it. [removes Squidward's phlegm from his eye] Ugh.
Squidward: [singing and dancing] ♪ No work for me today / Mr. Squidward gets to play / No customers for me to fear / SpongeBob can take a long walk off a very short pier ♪ [hears a knock on the front door] Oh, that must be the crudité I ordered. [Squidward opens the door] Well I... whoa!
[Squidward sees Mr. Krabs at his doorstep then he closes the door. Squidward comes out again, wearing a blanket and an ice pack.]
Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs. I didn't see you there. How thoughtful of you to visit me in my [fake cough] weekend state.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, think nothing of it, Mr. Squidward. You sounded so bad on the phone, I rushed right over to make sure you were taking good care of yourself.
Squidward: Well, I wouldn't want to infect anyone, so you should probably go now.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you are in no condition to be alone. That's why I brought you some help. [Mr. Krabs pulls out SpongeBob from behind his back wearing a doctor's outfit.] Take one of these and call me in the morning.
SpongeBob: The doctor is in!
Squidward: Uh... [SpongeBob wraps him up in a blanket and holds him like a baby]
SpongeBob: Swaddle, swaddle, swaddle. [Squidward tries to break free from him] Hush-a-bye now. Don't strain yourself. [kisses Squidward's eyes, making Squidward angry. Squidward pulls SpongeBob's lips and lets go of them, making him fling]
Squidward: Humph! [hops over to Mr. Krabs] Really, Mr. Krabs? This isn't necessary.
Mr. Krabs: Of course it is. [gets closer and closer to Squidward's face] If I find out you were faking it, just to get out of work, I'll have to fire ya!
Squidward: Oh, no faking here. [sweating] No, I'm really [fake wheezes] sick. [dashes away to SpongeBob] Okay, back to the swaddling.
[SpongeBob laughs, kisses Squidward again, puts his icepack on his head, and carries him into his own house. Mr. Krabs walks off laughing. Bubble transition to SpongeBob preparing soup. Meanwhile, Squidward is painting a masterpiece.]
Squidward: Oh, yes, I like that. Uh-huh, uh-huh, indeed.
[SpongeBob arrives with the soup but gasps to see Squidward enjoying himself.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, you're overexciting yourself! Now, you just rest that sick little body of yours while SpongeBob finishes up your self-portrait of you.
Squidward: But, but, but...
SpongeBob: [laughs while painting] Oh yeah, yeah! [laughs] Done. [shows a painting of SpongeBob feeding a baby Squidward with baby formula] In my imagination, you're a helpless, little baby. [the painting makes Squidward vomit] Gee, you're sicker than I thought. [Squidward continues to vomit] Bleh.
[Bubble transition to Squidward sleeping in his bed, and he opens his eyes to look around.]
Squidward: Hmm. [dashes out of his bed and into his art room] Just forget that yellow nuisance, and lose yourself in music. [plays a few squeaky notes and SpongeBob instantly comes over]
SpongeBob: Squidward! You shouldn't be wasting your breath in your weakened state. Let me blow the clarinet for you. [spins and takes Squidward's clarinet]
Squidward: No, no, don't touch my-
[SpongeBob begins playing the clarinet badly, and Squidward takes it from him, causing them to fall over. Squidward's clarinet is now in SpongeBob's mouth.]
SpongeBob: Bleh. [inhales, and launches the clarinet out of his mouth, causing him to be sent back and send the clarinet into Squidward's face, who takes the clarinet off his face and yells in frustration]
[Bubble transition to Squidward sleeping in bed again, this time with an ice pack on his head. He once again looks around and dashes out of bed. He enters the kitchen to check on the strudel in his oven.]
Squidward: Ah, the perfect strudel will make everything alright.
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward! [holds out a thermometer] Time to take your temperature.
Squidward: Get that thing away from my-! [SpongeBob shoves the thermometer into his mouth and takes it back out, leaving Squidward's tongue all over his own face.]
SpongeBob: [looking over the thermometer] Ah, ah, ah! Woo, 98.6! Oh, Squidward, you're all better! [hugs Squidward] I'm so happy we can both go to the Krusty Krab now.
Squidward: What? No! [shoves SpongeBob back and takes the thermometer back] Gimme that thing. You must've read it wrong. Hmm. [points to a wall] Hey, what's that over there?
SpongeBob: Oh, cool! A wall! [dashes towards the wall and feels it] So smooth. [laughs]
Squidward: [takes the thermometer out of the oven] Mm, hmm?
SpongeBob: Well, that was fun. Now let's check that thermometer again, shall we?
Squidward: [giving SpongeBob the thermometer] Here you go.
SpongeBob: [looks at the thermometer as it quickly rises in temperature, and his eyes turn into thermometers as well. They both explode] Yikes! A fever! Squidward, we gotta cool you off! [puts Squidward into the sink and turns on the sink]
Squidward: Stop!
SpongeBob: You're right, you need even colder. [he runs to a tundra, runs up a mountain, enters a cave, and scares an arctic sea bear as he comes out with a bucket of ice] Thank you!
Squidward: [gets off the sink, leaving a huge square indent in his butt] Oh boy.
SpongeBob: [splashes the cold water onto Squidward] There. All better?
Squidward: [shiving] N-no, you buffoon!
SpongeBob: You're right, Squidward. I have been... buffoon.
Squidward: W-what?!
SpongeBob: I've been treating the symptoms instead of the sickness! [pulls out a saw]
Squidward: Stay away from me with that thing!
SpongeBob: But we have to figure out what you have so we can treat it!
Squidward: [sweating] No, um, I already know what I have, it's, uh, acute... uh... spotting, uh, sclorboritis.
SpongeBob: Acute spotting sclorboritis?! I've never heard of that one. [holds out a book] Better look i [blows onto the book to remove the dust, which gets into Squidward's nose, making him sneeze 3 times] Oh, you're getting worse! We've gotta find a cure fast! [rapidly flips through pages] I found it. Here it is.
Squidward: [sniffling, snot dripping] You did?
SpongeBob: Yup. And the cure seems pretty simple. [he shows the pages to Squidward as a screaming sound effect plays] See?
Squidward: [pushes the book down] Uh, wait, wait, did I say acute spotting sclorboritis? No no no, I must've meant... uh, uh, Plerkinton's syndrome.
SpongeBob: [flipping through pages] Found it. [shows the pages] Now, let's get to the curing, shall we?
[Bubble transition to Squidward in a chair. SpongeBob puts a barrel on him, which puts leeches all over Squidward's body, making him scream and run away. He comes back shriveled up. Cut to Squidward sleeping, when SpongeBob is seen rubbing two jellyfish together]
Squidward: Huh? [SpongeBob puts the two jellyfish onto Squidward, electrocuting him]
[SpongeBob then uses a rake to rake the leaves in Squidward's lungs, making him gag. He pulls out a giant bag of leaves. Squidward then sneezes a pinecone into SpongeBob's left eye. Squidward is then seen shivering out of fear in his bed.]
Squidward: Are we done?
SpongeBob: Don't be silly. We've just begun. [pulls out several tools with six hands, making Squidward scream. The phone rings, which SpongeBob answers]
SpongeBob: Tentacles residence. SpongeBob speaking.
Mr. Krabs: [over the phone] Hello, me boy-o. How's the patient?
Squidward: [snatches the phone] Better. I'm all better. [crying] Please, just let me go back to work.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, nonsense. [his eyestalk comes out of the phone] You still look so sick. Better step up the cure, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [takes back the phone] Whatever you say, Mr. Krabs! [hangs up the phone, and pulls his tie. His pants open up and he takes the cure book inside, and starts flipping through pages] Ah ha! [he comes back with a sea urchin on a metal rod] Open wide. [the sea urchin opens its eyes and growls]
Squidward: You will not get that anywhere near my mouth.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Guess again.
[The scene cuts to an exterior shot of Squidward's house as Squidward is heard screaming. Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: So, the book told me to stretch his nose, shock him with jellyfish, and then I scraped his lungs and then cleaned them out with a toxic eating urchin.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs diabolically and wipes a tear from his eye] Priceless. [Squidward walks in the Krusty Krab, looking unwell] Well, Mr. Squidward, feeling better after your sick day?
Squidward: ""You might say that."" [takes off the blanket and transforms into Handsome Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] He's glorious.
Squidward: [in a deep voice] That's right! I used to be sick of everything, but I'm not sick anymore. [levitates around Mr. Krabs] I've been plagued by toxins and stress, built up over the years at this job, But SpongeBob washed those away. [Mr. Krabs gasps and falls] Now, who wants to order? [laughs, as he flexes his muscles]
Customers: Double Krabby Patty! [more overlapping dialogue] Squidward : [stops flexing muscles and looks, frowning]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Hey, Squidward. [pokes him with a spatula] Whoa, muscles.
Patrick: More layer pie.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.
Squidward: [his hair falls apart] No, no, no! [melts to the bottom of the cash register, then speaks in a normal voice] I think I'm going to be sick.",0.59,Ben Gruber

That night, Squidward is grocery shopping and is approached by a large thug (The Creepy Creeper). Squidward assumes he is going to steal his groceries, so he runs to SpongeBob and asks to be taught karate. However, because SpongeBob is not very good at it himself, he is unable to teach Squidward.They then go to Sandy for help. First, she makes Squidward promise not to use it for revenge and use it only for protection. Then, she and SpongeBob try to teach him, but cannot. When Squidward says that he had vengeance during training, Sandy then decides to quit on him, but Squidward says he would do anything, so Sandy makes him do all the work around the treedome, saying that it will teach him the basic movements. Finally, Squidward decides to quit. However, he accidentally flings acorns at himself that he is able to dodge. He then finds out that in doing all the work, he actually did learn karate.So then, Sandy presents him his belt to show that he knows karate, but Squidward claims that he has ""important business"" to attend. He then finds the thug and uses karate to beat him up, with a lot of the moves being related to the housework he did around the treedome.However, it turns out that he never wanted to steal his groceries; he wanted to return them. SpongeBob and Sandy then come to give Squidward his belt only to find out that he used karate for vengeance. Sandy says that Squidward does not deserve his belt, and SpongeBob scolds Squidward for not taking Sandy's advice. Then they walk away because Squidward dishonored their trust in him. However, Squidward has no shame of what he did and still considers himself as a karate master. Squidward is then arrested for assaulting the thug, as the episode ends.",Squid Defense,"[The episode starts with Squidward walking out of the Krusty Krab bathroom holding a newspaper.]
SpongeBob: Hiii... yah! [karate chops Squidward in the stomach] Squidward! Sorry, buddy, didn't see you. Are you okay?
Squidward: [holding his leg in pain; moans] What kind of unforeseen yet completely predictable stupidity have you ruined my day with this time?
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm just practicing my [chops with his hand] karate chops. I'm going to have [takes off his karate glove] an intense kar-a-tay session with Sandy later. Sandy says you never know what kind of creepy creeper could be creeping creepily around any creepy corner.
Squidward: Paranoid much?
SpongeBob: [spooked, chops Squidward in the torso again] Sorry, Squidward! I thought you were one of those creepy creepers. You know, Squidward, you really should learn how to protect yourself. Maybe you'd like to join us.
Squidward: Well... nope. I have more important things to do.
SpongeBob: Okey dokey, Squidward! Stop on by later if you change your mind about the karate.
Squidward: [pushes SpongeBob] I won't. [walks out of the Krusty Krab and scene changes to him walking in town with groceries. He then walks down a dark alley then turns around noticing something] Uh... hello? Is somebody there? [spots a large figure in the distance] Um... hello? It's considered rude not to answer! [the figure walks closer to him. He starts to act nervous] Hah... whatta ya got? Cotton in your ear holes? [laughs nervously as the figure gets even closer to him] I gotta get outta here! [starts to run away, walks face-first into a low ladder, then falls on the ground and drops the groceries, then notices the figure staring at him, gets up and runs to SpongeBob's house] SpongeBob! [starts banging on his door as the scene changes over to SpongeBob and Gary]
SpongeBob: [watching television with Gary while laughing] Oh, wait, I-I don't get it.
Squidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob! Open up! [the door opens and he falls on his face]
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: Hurry, SpongeBob! [pushes SpongeBob inside and closes the door]
SpongeBob: Squidward? What's wrong?
Squidward: You were... right!
SpongeBob: I was? About what?
Squidward: About how danger lurks around every corner! [screams as a shadow roars at him]
SpongeBob: Um, Squidward? [Gary is shown] It's just Gary.
Gary: [looking at the television] Meow meow meow meow meow!
SpongeBob: Hey, I should've named you ""Scary,"" eh buddy?
Gary: [laughs] Meow meow meow meow! [crawls away]
Squidward: SpongeBob, this is serious! I was just viciously attacked!
SpongeBob: [gasps] No!
Squidward: You gotta teach me, SpongeBob! Teach me the way! The way of tar-a-kay.
SpongeBob: Eh, don't you mean ""kar-a-tay?""
Squidward: Um... sure. Whatever.
[Bubble transition to Squidward and SpongeBob who is in his karate gear]
SpongeBob: [walking around Squidward] Hmm... hmm! Hmm... yes! You show potential young student! [grabs Squidward's arm] But with the rubbery arms and the doughiness in this area [pokes Squidward's belly] you obviously have our work cut out for us.
Squidward: Can't we just get on with this, SpongeBob? [SpongeBob shushes him, Squidward sighs] I mean can't get just get on with this ""O Great Sensei?""
SpongeBob: Pay close attention and you will receive the totality of my kar-a-tay mastery! Handed down from Sensei Cheeks herself. Now watch! Watch and learn. [walks over to a piece of wood and karate chops it the force breaks him in half]
Squidward: Uh huh. What else you got?
SpongeBob: That's it.
Squidward: That's it!? That's the ""totality"" of your karate mastery?
SpongeBob half 1: Well, Squidward. I've only been studying a couple of years. But if total karate knowledge is what you seek...
SpongeBob half 2: ...then you should visit Sensei Cheeks.
SpongeBob half 1: Hey! I was just going to say that!
SpongeBob half 2: I know! [both laugh]
Squidward: Oh boy...
[Karate chop transition to Sandy's Treedome]
Sandy: I don't know, SpongeBob. [grabs Squidward's arm] With the rubbery arms and doughiness in this area [pokes Squidward's belly] , we obviously-
Squidward: Alright already! We've been through this! Are you going to teach me how to get revenge on my attacker or what!?
Sandy: Whoa, oh, oh! Karate ain't for revenge. It's a delicate art that helps you protect yourself!
Squidward: Yeah, fine.
Sandy: Great! Now repeat after me: Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! [also karate chops]
Squidward: Oh... whatever. Hi-yah...
Sandy: ""I promise to use karate only for protection and not for revenge.""
Squidward: ""I promise to use karate only for protection and not for revenge."" Or whatever...
[Karate chop transition to SpongeBob, Sandy, and Squidward near a wooden board]
Sandy: Okay then! Let's get started with a little choppin'! Like so. Hi-yah! [karate chops the board in half, and SpongeBob does the same]
SpongeBob: Whoa!
Squidward: A board? I wasn't attacked by a piece of wood! I was assaulted by a deranged lunatic!
Sandy: The only way you'll protect yourself is if you know the basics. Now give it a chop!
Squidward: [sighs] Whatever you say, Sensei...
SpongeBob: This is a tough one, Squidward. Don't feel bad if you can't do it.
Squidward: I'm sure I can break one little twig! Hiiii... yah! [karate chops the board but it doesn't break. the force makes him shake and moves back on the treedome wall and he breaks apart on the ground]
[Karate chop transition to Sandy]
Sandy: Arms up Squidward! Block! Block! [Squidward gets hit by acorns thrown by SpongeBob] Block! Block!
Squidward: [grumbles] This is stupid! The only thing this maniac threw at me were his big, meaty fists! [raises his hands up but SpongeBob continues to throw acorns at him. Then he throws a acorn at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [blocks the acorn with his elbow] Block!
Sandy: Now that's how you do it!
Squidward: Dimwit's luck! [gets hit by another acorn]
[Karate chop transition to the tree of them near a sandbag]
SpongeBob: Come on, Squiddy! Give it the ol' roundhouse!
Squidward: Alright... [moves backwards] Hi-yah! [kicks the sandbag but gets stuck to it and starts to get smacked over and over and is thrown in front of Sandy] This isn't working! [walks back toward the sandbag] My assailant was twice as tall! And his shoulders were twenty times as broad! The furrows of his brow with the size of biceps!
Sandy: Hmm... we're gotta make this more personal for you, Squidward. So as to help you bring out your inner dragon! SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: [jumps in wearing a ski mask] Hey! Grocery boy! It is me! A big, scary miscreant! Now hand over that sack of groceries before things get ugly!
Squidward: Groceries? You'll have to pull my groceries from my cold, wet tentacles, bucko! Take this! Hi-yah! [tries to karate chop SpongeBob but his arm gets stuck to his helmet] Huh? Think that's going to stop me!? You're not getting me without a fight! Hi-yah! [tries to kick SpongeBob but his feet retract and get stuck to his helmet as well. He starts moving around on the ground getting more and more tangled] Got you... right where... I want you! [moves around again becoming fully tangled] Vengeance... is... mine!
Sandy: Vengeance? Squidward Tentacles, I told ya at the beginning that karate ain't for revenge! Sorry Squidward. As of now, I ain't your sensei no more! [walks off]
Squidward: Sandy! Wait! [tries to move] I need you to teach... [sighs] ... Oh, this is pointless. [struggles] I'll never be able to protect myself. [struggles] I may as well start handing my groceries to criminals. Here! Please Mr. Criminal! [struggles] Take my unprocessed kale cream.
SpongeBob: Sandy! Wait! Please! Help him! He just want to keep his organic, blue algae safe.
Sandy: He's going to use my teachings for revenge, SpongeBob.
Squidward: Please, Sandy! I'll do anything!
Sandy: Oh, really? Well, Squidward, a wise sensei once told me: [takes out a mop] ""One must first know the movements of everyday, before mastering ka-rah-tay!
[Karate chop transition to a short montage with Squidward first mopping in Sandy's house. He then tries to turn on a vacuum but doesn't turn on. He kicks it and it finally turns on and starts to clean up making the place spotless]
Squidward: Phew! All finished!
Sandy: Wow! This looks great!
SpongeBob: [to Squidward] Psst! You missed a spot!
[Squidward growls. Karate chop transition to him with water hoses tied to him spraying the grass]
Sandy: Alright! I reckon the yard is good and watered!
SpongeBob: Psst! You missed a spot!
[Squidward mumbles angrily. Karate chop transition to him shoveling the ground]
Squidward: Phew! [grabs the bucket of acorns and pours them into the hole he dug up]
Sandy: Atta boy Squiddy! [on a beach chair next to SpongeBob] Be sure to twist that torso!
SpongeBob: Hey Sandy? [stretches] I don't remember this being a part of my training.
Sandy: It wasn't! But today is chore day! So I'd figured why not fry two fish in one skillet! [she and SpongeBob laugh]
Squidward: That's it! I am outta here! This is a no good waste of my time! [rams his foot onto a bucket of acorns and they start to fly toward him. He blocks them all away] Hey! I'm doing it! I'm blocking the acorns!
Sandy: Yee-haw! I told you all you had to do is know the movements of everyday to master karate!
Squidward: [laughs] I can't believe I did it!
SpongeBob: [holding a wooden board] Yeah! Yeah! Now try this!
Squidward: Okay! Okay! Hi-yah! [chops the wooden board and SpongeBob in half and laughs] I did it! [starts running then jumps] Hi-yah! [kicks the Slug Buddy punching bag destroying it] I can protect my groceries now! Hi-yah! [kicks SpongeBob toward the glass wall and breaks him apart. SpongeBob holds a thumbs up] I am a karate master! Woo hoo hoo!
Sandy: Well, I wouldn't go that far. But you have proven yourself worthy of... [takes out a belt] ...the Belt of Basic Competence!
Squidward: Yeah yeah, that's great, thanks. But I have some business to attend to!
[Squidward walks off. Karate chop transition to him walking down a dark alley.]
Squidward: Heh heh heh... What's this? Do I find myself on this dark and scary street, yet again? We'll just see what happens! [walks down further into the alley] This time!
Man: Hey! You! [starts walking toward Squidward]
Squidward: Let me give him a taste! A mere morsel of what's in store! [karate chops] Hi-yah! [kicks] Hi-yah! [flips] Hi-yah! That one was called Washing Sandy's Windows! [the man walks closer] Stay back or you're gonna get it! I am warning you! [the man continues to walk closer breathing heavily] Okay buddy, I warned ya! [near a trash can] I like to call this one Taking Out Sandy's Trash! Hi-yah! [kicks the trash can toward the man]
Man: What? [gets hit on the head by the trash can] Ow!
Squidward: [laughs] How do you like them apples? Wah! [punches a crate at the man]
Man: Oh! Ow!
Squidward: [holding two wooden planks] Hah! Feel my wrath! [throws them] How's your uncle?!
Man: [gets hit on the head by one of the planks] Ow! [the other hits him on the stomach] Ow!
Squidward: And as my finishing move! I give you Watering Sandy's Lawn! He-yah! [spin kicks a dumpster at the man. Then pushes it off of him]
Man: Oh... hey, man! Wha-what was that for? [holding Squidward's groceries] I was just trying to give you back your groceries you dropped!
Squidward: [takes the groceries] Uh, oh.
SpongeBob: Sandy! I found him! He's over here! [holding the belt] You forgot your belt silly! [looks at the man and gasps]
Sandy: Gosh! What happened to you?
SpongeBob: This guy's been... ka-rah-tayed!
Sandy: After all I said about never using karate for revenge?
SpongeBob: For shame, Squidward. For shame .
Sandy: Looks like he's not worthy of this belt after all. [takes the belt] Thanks for dishonoring our trust in you, Squidward. [walks off with SpongeBob] .
Squidward: Whatever! I'm still a karate master!
Officer John: Wow, really? You are? [walks Squidward to the police car]
Squidward: Yes I am!
Officer John: Hey watch your head. [Squidward gets into the police car. Then John gets into it] Oh, I'd never guess it.
Squidward: And what is that supposed to mean?
Officer John: Oh, uh... nothing. Just with the rubbery arms and the doughiness in the midsection...
Squidward: Okay, already! I get it! [notices the handcuffs on him] What? Wait a second. Am I under arrest?
Officer John: You sure are! And you have the right to remain silent... [Squidward screams loudly] ...or not silent. [drives off as the episode ends]",3.70,"Casey Alexander,Zeus Cervas,Blake Lemons,Derek Iversen"

As she serves a customer, Narlene and Nobby pop out of some barrels and remind SpongeBob of his promise to show her around the big city. SpongeBob bemoans that he can't leave the Krusty Krab, so Pearl volunteers while Nobby takes her place. Pearl then takes Mr. Krabs' credit card so they can start their trip.Pearl and Narlene soon arrive in the big city, where Narlene collects all the gum that's been left on the pavement. The two wander around and take in the sights, like the skyscrapers and public transport. Back at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob stresses over the fact he can't reach the fryer from the grill, so Nobby starts moving all the various machines closer to SpongeBob.Eventually, Pearl and Narlene end up at the heart of the big city; Upturn's, a large skyscraper-like department store. Narlene is fascinated by the automatic sliding door and accidentally rips it off, drawing the ire of Upturn's owner, Lady Upturn. Narlene flattens Upturn with the door, and Pearl apologizes for Narlene's behavior, before showing her their credit card. Lady Upturn forgives them, but warns them that at Upturn's, they take shopping seriously.The two soon arrive at the perfume department, where Narlene is put off by the fancy smells. After the manager sprays perfume in her face, she uses her own toadstool tang perfume, which causes a huge stink that drives everyone out. Pearl and Narlene then try some clothes, before going to a sale at the shoe department. Narlene's dislike of shoes makes her destroy a stiletto, causing the manager to realize the two are the wanted ruffians, before calling security.Pearl and Narlene try to escape, but the security guards surround them as Lady Upturn arrives. Pearl tries to apologize, but Lady Upturn ignores her, stating that the two will never shop at Upturn's again. They escape to the store's roof, where Lady Upturn comments that country visitors like Narlene is especially unwelcome. This makes Pearl stick up for Narlene, calling Lady Upturn a snob, before trying to use Narlene's gum to let them escape. The guards stop them, but Pearl throws their credit card off the building, causing the guards and Lady Upturn to jump after it.The two make it back to the Krusty Krab, where Nobby is causing chaos. Narlene whistles for him to stop, before thanking Pearl for the day out, and hopes to take her to the countryside as thanks. Mr. Krabs then complains about the credit card bill from their day out, causing Pearl to decide to go to the country right then. As Pearl and Narlene ride away on Nobby, Mr. Krabs gives chase, and the episode ends in the cluttered kitchen with SpongeBob calling for help beneath all the machines.",Upturn Girls,"[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab. There is a long line of customers, and Mr. Krabs is standing at the register, humming happily and writing on a notepad. The order window is completely stuffed with papers.]
Fish: Hey, let's go! Come on!
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs tears off a paper and is about to put it through the order window, but notices that it is full.] Hm? [He pushes them away and looks into the kitchen.] Hey! What's the hold-up in there? You're acting like you've never cooked a Krabby Patty before. [He rings the bell twice with his eyestalks. The camera zooms out to show Pearl at the grill, holding two patties while buns are on the grill.]
Pearl: Yeah, Dad, that's because I never have cooked a Krabby Patty before. Why are you making me do this? [She puts two patties between two buns.]
Mr. Krabs: Because today is bring--I mean, put your daughter to work day. Besides, SpongeBob is busy deep cleaning the barrel chairs.
[SpongeBob is scrubbing the inside of a chair, which a blue fish is sitting on.]
Fish: [disgusted] Do you mind?
SpongeBob: [happily] Oh no, not at all!
Pearl: [Pearl walks up, holding her Krabby Patty on a plate.] Here's your food or whatever. [She drops it on the table.] Oh, hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hi, Pearl. Isn't this just the best job ever? [He flutters his eyelashes. He is suddenly pulled towards the chair by something inside. He struggles and bounces backwards, but sees his left arm missing. He crawls back to the chair and looks inside, only for his arm to poke back out.]
Narlene: [coming out of the barrel] How-dy, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [happy] Narlene! [looking around] Hey, where's your brother, Nobby?
[Pearl is filing her nails. A customer's chair starts vibrating, and Nobby stands up, carrying it on his head.]
Nobby: [tipping chair] Ma'am.
Narlene: Me and Nobby was just on our way to the big city, so we thought we'd take you up on your offer [whips SpongeBob's arm over his head] to show us the sights. [She scratches her arm with SpongeBob's hand.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, I'd love to! [takes out a brochure labeled ""Bikini Bottom"" and flips through it] We can say hi to my favorite fire hydrant, [shows page, then flips through brochure] and then we can see the old man that feeds the clams, [shows page, then flips through brochure] and then [shows page with a sticky note labeled ""Cool Rock,"" and a picture of a rock, but then suddenly realizes something and stops] --no. [flips through brochure, then throws it away] I can't abandon these lovely people.
[Cut to a close-up of various grotesque Krusty Krab patrons. Chewing and burping is heard.]
Pearl: [a lightbulb forms over her blowhole] Ooh, then why don't I show you around the big city? I don't care about these people.
Narlene: Little Pearly's gonna take us on an adventure? [slaps her knee with SpongeBob's hand] Hot dippity!
Pearl: Anything to get out of this place. [clapping] It'll be a whale's day out!
Nobby: [takes Pearl's employee hat and puts it on his head, then salutes] Hard day's work! [He jumps over to a Krusty Krab patron and shoves her Krabby Patty in her mouth, then makes her chew.]
Narlene: Nobby says he's fixing to stay and help SpongeBob with the hungry folk. So, Pearl, looks like we got ourselves a deal! [spits on her foot and sticks out to Pearl]
Pearl: [disgusted, but shakes her foot] Okay...
Narlene: This'll be great. Two whale gals reconnoitering the big city together! [Pearl wipes her hand on a disgusted customer's back.]
Pearl: If we want to do that [making air quotes] ""noitering"" thing in the city, I'll need an advance on my allowance.
[Krabs is taking a customer's money at the register. The screen shakes as Pearl runs up.]
Pearl: Oh, Daddy! [sticks out her hand]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs sadly, then takes out a wooden card] Alright, here you go.
Pearl: Ugh, Dad, we can't have a whale's day out [a close-up of the card is accompanied with a sad trumpet noise] with your balsa wood card. [takes his wallet and pulls out a diamond card] We need the diamond unlimited! [the card sparkles as a harp plays]
Mr. Krabs: [defeated] My diamond...
[In downtown Bikini Bottom, Narlene and Pearl ride on a plastic scuba diver figure.]
Narlene: I never took the Scuber before, but it sure is mighty convenient. 'Preciate the lift. [She and Pearl jump off, and the Scuber paddles away. Narlene has stepped in some chewing gum.] Huh? I'll be! These city streets is paved with chewing candy. [lifts her foot up] I'm saving you as a souvenir! [She takes the gum and eats it, then notices other gum on the street. She steps on all of it in sequence, then sticks her foot in her mouth.] Tasty!
Pearl: Uh, the city also has a lot of things in it that aren't gross.
Narlene: Really? [grabs Pearl to her side] Oh, like these fancy shacks here? [the camera zooms out to show a tall building labeled ""Sārdell Bldg.""]
Pearl: Yeah, these are skyscrapers. [camera pans up to reveal the top of the building literally tearing through the sky]
Narlene: And that? [She points to three miserable-looking business fish standing at a bus station. A bus runs by and splashes water on them.]
Pearl: That's public transportation! [They walk away. The ""Bus Stop"" sign falls and hits one of the fish on the head.]
Business fish: Ow!
[A construction worker uses his jackhammer on a pothole.]
Narlene: What's he doin'?
Pearl: [covering her ears] Street construction! [They run away. The construction worker blows on the hole, then walks away, clapping his hands once.]
Construction worker: Heh heh! [A bus runs over the pothole and flips over, then explodes. A tire bounces over Narlene and Pearl, who duck.]
Narlene: Why, it's like walking through a TV show!
[SpongeBob is cooking at the Krusty Krab. He takes his hat off and wipes his head.]
SpongeBob: Phew! [puts his hat back on, then looks at the grill] Ahh! [an alarm goes off] Huh? [The deep fryer's timer beeps.] Uh-oh, the fries! [SpongeBob reaches towards it.] If only I could reach them...
Nobby: [washing SpongeBob's employee hats and hanging them on a clothesline] Huh? [Nobby jumps over to the deep fryer and lifts it. He carries it over to SpongeBob, then drops it behind him.]
SpongeBob: Oh! [is bounced by the impact of the fryer hitting the ground] Wow, thanks, Nobby! [He lifts up a basket of fries while grilling at the same time.] Now if only the condiments were closer. [Nobby drops the condiment table to his right.]
Nobby: Here you go! [babbling]
SpongeBob: [laughs, then squirts ketchup and mustard on a patty] Too bad the bun rack is on the other side of the room! [Nobby pushes the bun rack to SpongeBob's left. He is completely boxed in, and cooks rapidly. Nobby begins moving other furniture towards him.] Oh, yeah! This is what I call fast food!
[Downtown, a big building is seen. Pearl and Narlene look up at it.]
Pearl: This is my favorite department store and, like, the heart of the big city: [they run up to the entrance] Upturn's! [Pearl opens the door and motions inside. Many fancy-looking fish are seen walking around. Pearl walks inside, and Narlene follows, but stops once she notices the automatic glass door.]
Narlene: Huh? Ooh! [She sticks her foot out and opens the door. She pulls it back, and the door closes. She does this repeatedly, crushing a customer between the doors.] These here automatic doors sure is frilly, but we hillfolk do things a little more polite-like. [She rips off one of the doors.] Right this way, sir!
Crushed customer: [groans ""thank you"" and crawls inside]
[Lady Upturn is standing besides Narlene, watching the customer crawl. She turns to Narlene.]
Lady Upturn: Excuuuuse me? What do you think you're doing?
Narlene: Uh, holdin' the door? Here, you try! [She drops the door on Lady Upturn, crushing her. Pearl walks in.]
Pearl: [concerned] Narlene, that's Lady Upturn! [She flips the door and helps Lady Upturn get up, then laughs nervously.] I'm so sorry. She's new in town. [takes out her diamond card] But we'll be good shoppers, I swear! [Lady Upturn inspects the card with a diamond-studded magnifier.]
Lady Upturn: Hmm, yes. Carry on, [patting their heads] my little consumers. [grabs their shirts] But here at Upturn's, we take shopping seriously.
Narlene and Pearl: [nodding] Okay. [They sprint off.]
[Pearl and Narlene go to Upturn'd Nose, a perfume department.]
Pearl: Welcome to the perfume department!
[Narlene looks through various perfume bottles. An employee blows out a puff of pink perfume from a small bottle, which Narlene inhales.]
Narlene: [coughing, then sneezes] Phew-wee! I think something done died up in here.
Pearl: Died [jumps onto a perfume cloud and twirls in mid-air] and went to heaven! [She sinks into the cloud and rides it around.] Yeah! [inhales the perfume] Aaah, ambergris!
Narlene: I-- [A shark salesman appears and sprays perfume in her mouth, making her choke. She rubs her tongue in disgust, and the salesman smiles.] Why, you!
Salesman: Yeeeeeees?
Narlene: [angry] What's your problem?
Salesman: I've got a clean up on aisle [flicks Narlene's horn] you. [plugs his nose] Perhaps another sample spritz?
Narlene: [walking away] Sorry, but I ain't too 'ticular about that stench.
Salesman: [uninterested] Ehh.
Narlene: Besides, I carry my own signature stench! [Pearl sprays a bottle of perfume and smells it, but then stops in shock.]
Pearl: Huh?
Narlene: [takes out a large mushroom] Toadstool tang! [she squeezes it and creates a green stench cloud that covers the screen] Ya-hoo!
Salesman: [smells it and melts] My nose! [The cloud flies over Pearl, who ducks. Various other shoppers smell it, cough, and melt.] The horrible stench!
Shoppers: [coughing, screaming]
[Everyone runs out of Upturn'd Nose, followed by the cloud. Narlene follows them, but Pearl grabs her and runs in a different direction.]
Pearl: Come on, we better cheese it!
[Cut to a changing room. Pearl comes out, wearing a blue dress like Lady Upturn's.]
Pearl: [imitating Lady Upturn] What do you think about this cool dress?
Narlene: [her head comes out of a Lady Upturn mannequin] I don't know. It's kinda constricting.
[A ding noise is heard. Pearl and Narlene laugh. A female voice comes over a loudspeaker.]
Announcer: Attention, Upturn's shoppers. There's a sale in the shoe department. Tenth floor.
Pearl: Come on! [she runs off and grabs Narlene]
[They take the elevator from the 3rd floor to the 10th. Pearl runs out and stops suddenly.]
Pearl: So. Many. Shoes! [Pan over to fancy-looking fish trying on shoes. Pearl smiles, but Narlene is confused.]
Narlene: Huh? [The shark salesman jams a fish's large foot into a small slipper.] Hoo? [The salesman welds a metal boot onto a customer's foot.] Huh!? [The salesman tightens a shoelace with his teeth, causing the wearer's leg to turn red. He winks at Narlene. Narlene hops on one foot to Pearl.] Uh... no offense, Pearly girl, uh, but [shot of Narlene's bare feet] my feet don't cotton much to shoes.
Salesman: As the saying goes, [takes out a measuring tape] there's a tiny shoe for every giant foot [He whips Narlene with the tape measure, causing her to spin around and sit on a small chair. He puts the tape measure on Narlene's foot.] May I?
Narlene: Well, uh... [The salesman pulls up a box and takes out a red slipper.] Well, if the shoe fits! [Her foot walks up to the shoe, but then tears it to shreds like a dog.]
Salesman: You slaughtered my stiletto!
Narlene: Sorry. [shrugs] I told you.
Salesman: [looks at Narlene and Pearl] Wait a minute. I know you two. You're those hooligans! [Pan over to a phone and a black-and-white photo of Narlene and Pearl. The salesman runs over and grabs the phone.] It's those wily whales! Code red! [an alarm goes off, and the screen is tinted with a red-black filter.]
[Pearl and Narlene look at each other, then run off. They leave the escalator, and the salesman looks out from behind it.]
Salesman: Ha ha! [He runs after them, stopping them outside of a closing store. Security guards jump out from behind some mannequins]
Security guards: Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut hut! [...] [A flower pot breaks, revealing a guard inside. A fancy-looking waiter explodes to reveal two guards stacked on top of each other. Guards descend from the ceiling on ropes, with one spinning rapidly. Lady Upturn is standing at the top of the stairs, and a spotlight shines on her.]
Pearl: Aah! Lady Upturn! [clasps hands] I'm Sorry! Narlene and I were just having some fun!
Lady Upturn: Fun? [descends the stairs] Shopping isn't supposed to be fun . Fortunately for me, [points at them] you'll never be shopping here again!
Pearl: But I had the diamond unlimited card! [cries]
Security guards: [brandishing weapons] Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut! [...]
Narlene: [alarm dings] Come on, let's get! [She and Pearl run into an elevator, and end up on top of the building. They run to the edge, but notice the far drop down. A VIP elevator opens, and the security guards come out, followed by Lady Upturn.]
Security guards: Hut, hut, hut, hut! [...]
Lady Upturn: You, young ladies, do not belong here. Especially [points to Narlene] her .
Narlene: [confused] Uh?
Pearl: So what if my friend doesn't do things the way city people do? At least she's not a stuck-up snob like [points] you!
Lady Upturn: [offended] Oh!
Pearl: Besides, we cetacean sisters always stick together! [She squeezes Narlene, causing her to stick out her tongue, which has a wad of gum on it. She smiles at Narlene.]
Narlene: [happy] Ah!
[Pearl takes the gum and sticks it in her blowhole. She starts straining and puffs it up.]
Lady Upturn: [surprised] Oh!
[Pearl's gum bubble blows up more, lifting her and Narlene into the air.]
Narlene: Yee-haw!
[The shark salesman, dressed as a security guard, blows a whistle three times.]
Narlene: Ha ha! Whoa! [The security guards, and the salesman, have grabbed onto Narlene.]
Pearl: Whoa, oh! [She takes out her diamond card, and drops it. The salesman whistles as it falls by him, and the guards fall down.]
Lady Upturn: [screams] Diamond unlimited! [She jumps off the edge of the building and yells. She falls into a pile of guards, but weakly holds up the diamond card.] I've got it!
[A wad of gum appears through the Krusty Krab ceiling, which pops to reveal Pearl and Narlene, who fall to the floor.]
Pearl: [blows bubbles out of her blowhole] Huh? Ah, [a Krabby Patty hits a nearby customer] ah!
Nobby: [throws Krabby Patties at customers and babbles] Huh! Huh! [throws one, which hits the glass behind Narlene] My bad! [Narlene whistles with her fingers. Nobby runs towards her, babbling excitedly.]
Narlene: Awww! [Nobby hugs her tightly, then lets go.] Looks like they worked you like a horse.
Nobby: Yeah! [His head morphs into a horse's head. He eats a sugar cube out of Narlene's hands.]
Narlene: Aww! [Nobby laughs. Pearl walks up, and Narlene slaps her on the back.] Thanks for the whale's day out, Pearl, but the big city's more trouble than it's worth. Next time, you're coming to the [slaps her playfully] countryside!
Pearl: [excited] Yeah! Let's do that sometime! [They kick their feet together a few times.]
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of his office with a long bill] Pearl! What's the deal with all these charges at Upturn's?
Pearl: Why wait? Let's go to the countryside right now! [She and Narlene jump on Nobby's back. Pearl uses her hairband like a bridle, and Nobby bucks like a horse.] Goodbye, Daddy! See you real soon.
Narlene: Sooner than ya think!
Mr. Krabs: [screams, then runs after them waving his arms] Wait, wait! Where do you think you're going? You can't go away now!

He's eager to get ready for the day that he is to apply for a fry cook job at the Krusty Krab. He warms up by lifting a weight with stuffed animals before jogging to the restaurant with his iconic ""I'm ready!"", while Patrick Star encourages him from his rock.SpongeBob starts talking about what job he will do when he reaches the Krusty Krab, but feels like his reach is not ready. Patrick then appears, encouraging him that he was born to have a job. SpongeBob eventually decides to go to the Krusty Krab to get the job. Squidward sees SpongeBob running to the restaurant, causing him to panic and to tell Mr. Krabs to watch out for SpongeBob.SpongeBob has already arrived, though, and he tries to get Mr. Krabs to give him the job after jumping back and forth across the restaurant after tripping on a loose nail. He tells Mr. Krabs that Squidward will vouch for him, but Squidward tells Mr. Krabs that he does not believe SpongeBob should get the job. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob that if he gets a seemingly nonexistent hydro-dynamic spatula, he will get the job. SpongeBob quickly runs to the Barg'N-Mart to get it, as Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh, thinking he will not have the job.Soon after SpongeBob leaves, five buses filled with a bunch of hungry anchovies arrive at the restaurant, making Squidward and Mr. Krabs panic, as the latter knows what happens when anchovies come. As the anchovies flood the restaurant, Squidward tries to get them all settled, but they're still crazy. It seems the two are both finished due to the flood of anchovies, but then SpongeBob arrives with the hydrodynamic spatula he found (as there was only one in stock), having fulfilled the errand Mr. Krabs gave him and leaving the two in stunned surprise. SpongeBob goes into the kitchen and, in a montage accompanied by Tiny Tim's ""Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight,"" cooks many Krabby Patties then tosses them to all the hungry anchovies until they all feel satisfied and leave the restaurant.Mr. Krabs recruits SpongeBob as a fry cook thanks to him saving the Krusty Krab from the anchovies, much to Squidward's chagrin, then goes to his office to count the day's profits. Then, Patrick walks into the restaurant and order a Krabby Patty, prompting SpongeBob to create a slew of patties and chuck them all at him, flinging the former out. Squidward tells Mr. Krabs to go see SpongeBob and possibly get him in trouble for the mess he made.",Help Wanted,"Note 1: Line in maroon is cut from the 1999 version.

[The episode opens with a bubble transition, and we see a coral reef under the sea. The camera zooms to initiate parallax scrolling, which reveals the city of Bikini Bottom. It continues zooming to show a brown rock, a Moai head, and a pineapple, which each contain inhabitants.]
French Narrator : Ah, the sea... so fascinating. So wonderful. Here, we see Bikini Bottom, teeming with life. [shows from left to right Patrick's, Squidward's, and SpongeBob's houses. Zooms in on SpongeBob's house.] Home to one of my favorite creatures, SpongeBob SquarePants. Yes, of course he lives in a pineapple, you silly.
[Scene cuts to the house's bedroom. A sea snail is seen sleeping near a pile of newspapers on the floor, a scallop is seen in a birdcage, and a young, optimistic yellow sea sponge is seen sleeping in his bed, snoring as his foghorn alarm clock ticks. SpongeBob's alarm then sounds. He wakes, but is unaffected by the annoying sound, and with a smile on his face, turns it off. He climbs from his bed to a ladder, leading to his diving board.]
SpongeBob SquarePants: Today's the big day, Gary!
Gary the Snail: Meow.
SpongeBob: [jumps on the diving board] Look at me, I'm... [jumps up, and leaves his underwear behind] ..naked! [lands inside his pants, then runs toward his exercise room. His head pops out of the top of his pants.] Gotta be in top physical condition for today, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [taking deep breaths, he prepares to lift a barbell that is balanced by two lightweight stuffed animals. He sticks out his chest, but almost passes out because he can barely lift it. He drops it, and it makes a ""squeak"" noise] I'm ready! [runs outside] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! [as he speaks, a dimwitted sea star's rock tilts upwards with a chubby pink starfish stuck to its underside.]
Patrick Star: Go, SpongeBob! [falls] Whoa! [crash sound effect]
SpongeBob (1997 Version): [runs down the street to the Krusty Krab] I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! [jumps in the air as the scene freezes and a title reads SpongeBob SquarePants]
French Narrator (1997 Version): SpongeBob SquarePants!
[It shows SpongeBob running through various landscapes, as it shows a frozen scene of SpongeBob standing in front of the Krusty Krab the scene unfreezes and then the episode continues as normal]
[Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: There it is. The finest eating establishment ever established for eating: The Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty... with a Help Wanted sign in the window. For years I've been dreaming of this moment. I'm gonna go in there, march straight to the manager, look 'em straight in the eye [breaks the fourth wall and looks the audience in the eye] , lay it on the line and... I can't do this! [starts to run home, but Patrick stops him.] Hey, Patrick-
Patrick: Where do you think you're going?
SpongeBob: I was just...
Patrick: No, you're not. You're going to the Krusty Krab and get! That! Job!
SpongeBob: I can't, don't you see? I'm not good enough.
Patrick: Whose first words were ""May I take your order?""?
SpongeBob: Mine were.
Patrick: Who made a spatula out of toothpicks in wood shop?
SpongeBob: I did.
Patrick: [grimaces and contorts twice while trying to come up with a good third line] Who's a, uh, who's uh, oh! And who's a big yellow cube with holes?
SpongeBob: I am!
Patrick: Who's ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Patrick: Who's ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Patrick: Who's ready?!
SpongeBob: I'm ready! [runs toward the Krusty Krab.] I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!
[A turquoise octopus is seen cleaning graffiti on the restaurant's windows by spraying stain remover and attempting to wipe it off.]
Squidward J. Q. Tentacles : [cleaning graffiti of himself with the word ""loser,"" sees SpongeBob approaching, and sighs] Oh no, SpongeBob. What could he possibly want?
SpongeBob: [in background, at first while Squidward was talking] I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, self!
[Squidward looks at the Help Wanted sign, screams, and runs inside to warn Mr. Krabs ]
Squidward: [While SpongeBob says, ""I'm ready,"" one more time in the background] Mr. Krabs! [cuts to the ordering window, where a greedy crab is seen happily sniffing a handful of money. Squidward runs up to him.] Hurry, Mr. Krabs, before it's too late, I gotta tell you- [interrupted by SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Permission to come aboard, captain! [deep voice] I've been training my whole life for the day I could join the Krusty Krew [normal voice] and now I'm ready!
[SpongeBob trips on a nail stuck in the floorboard. He bounces back and forth on the ground, and shouts and blurts incomprehensibly upon each hit. The restaurant manager, a red crab and Squidward look at each other. His fall causes him to bounce against the ceiling. SpongeBob yet again shouts and blurts incomprehensibly while his bounces and ricochets around the building accelerate. He then rolls to a stop at the feet of Squidward and Mr. Krabs.]
SpongeBob: So, uh, when do I start?
Eugene Harold Krabs: Well, lad, it looks like you don't even have your sea legs.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, please! I'll prove I'm fry cook material! Ask Squidward, he'll vouch for me.
[Mr. Krabs and Squidward quickly walk away from SpongeBob. Squidward looks at Mr. Krabs.]
Squidward: [deep breath] No.
[Mr. Krabs winks. Squidward and Mr. Krabs head back to SpongeBob, who looks completely puzzled at what he's hearing]
Mr. Krabs: Well, lad, we'll give you a test, and if you pass, you'll be on the Krusty Krew. Go out and fetch me... a... [SpongeBob takes out a notepad] uh, hydrodynamic spatula... [SpongeBob quickly jots down what he says] with, um, port-and-starboard-attachments, [more scribbling] and, uh... turbo drive. [more scribbling] And don't come back ‘til you get one. [puts a Krusty Krab crew hat on SpongeBob's head.]
[SpongeBob sees how he looks in a mirror, there are sparkles on his hat, and he has a huge, satisfied smile]
SpongeBob: [saluting Krabs] Aye aye, captain! [reading] One hydrodynamic spatula, with port-and-starboard attachments, turbo drive, coming right up, sir! [salutes again]
Mr. Krabs: Carry on! [SpongeBob leaves] We'll never see that lubber again.
Squidward: [smiling] You're terrible. A hydro-what?
[Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh. While Squidward laughs, his nose moves distinctly while he inhales and exhales. Mr. Krabs' laugh sounds like a pirate. As they laugh, SpongeBob is shown leaving the Krusty Krab. As SpongeBob fades out of sight, five buses drive toward the Krusty Krab from the opposite direction.]
Bus driver: Hey! Hey! Please! Passengers are to stay seated and not put their fins out the window!
[The five buses surround the Krusty Krab and the bus doors open. Mr. Krabs stops laughing. Squidward also stops laughing but embarrassingly smiles at Mr. Krabs' attentive gesture.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] That sounded like hatch doors! [sniffs repeatedly] Do you smell it? That smell... A kind of smelly smell... A smelly smell that smells... smelly... [his eyes widen in shock, whispering] Anchovies.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: [loudly] Anchovies!
[The anchovies get out of the buses and rush inside the Krusty Krab, crowding, repeating the word ""eat"" over and over again]
Squidward: Please, please, quiet! [the anchovies stop talking] Is this any way to behave, hmm?
Anchovy: Eat.
Squidward: Could we show a little decency and form a neat, single file line in front of the register?
[The anchovies stare for a moment, then pick up the boat, as their cries of ""eat!"" become more intense. Cut to Barg'N-Mart as SpongeBob enters.]
SpongeBob: [singing to himself] ♪ Barg'N-Mart, meeting all of your spatula needs. ♪
[Cuts back to the Krusty Krab. Squidward and Mr. Krabs are still in the boat register, and being tossed around like a ship in a storm.]
Mr. Krabs: All hands on deck! Get your anchors out of your pants!
Squidward: One single file line is all I ask!
Mr. Krabs: Whoa! [he and Squidward are thrown up in the air] Batten down the hatches, Mr. Squidward! [they get thrown back up again; the boat is in splinters] We're takin' on water, Mr. Squidward! [they get thrown back up again, with Krabs clutching Squidward] I want my mommy, Mr. Squidward! [cuts to Barg'N-Mart]
SpongeBob: [singing] ♪ Do do do do do do, spatula, spatula, port-and-starboard attachments. ♪
[Cuts back to the Krusty Krab. Squidward and Mr. Krabs are sent towards a pole by a wave of anchovies.]
Squidward: Help!
Mr. Krabs: Man overboard! Climb, Mr. Squidward! Climb! [They climb the mast, while the anchovy flood rises. The anchovies then form a big wave twice.]
Anchovies: Eat! Eat!
Mr. Krabs: This is the end! [shaking hands with Squidward] Goodbye, Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs!
[Mr. Krabs and Squidward cry, then SpongeBob comes in with red lights flashing and flying with the spatula, singing a heroic tune]
SpongeBob: Permission to come aboard captain! Da da da da da da da! Da da da da da da da da da da! Did someone order a spatula?
Squidward and Mr. Krabs: [stuttering in shock at SpongeBob getting the hydrodynamic spatula]
SpongeBob: That's right! One hydrodynamic spatula with [two spatulas pop out on the sides of the previous one] port-and-starboard attachments! And let's not forget the turbo drive! [the two extending spatulas twirl around and smack Squidward and Mr. Krabs in the face] Would you believe they only had one in stock? To the kitchen! [to the anchovies] Who's hungry?!
[Tiny Tim's ""Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight"" plays while SpongeBob flies through the kitchen window. A montage of SpongeBob making and serving Krabby Patties plays. SpongeBob crashes into a box of patties and shoots them with his eyes toward the grill.]
Tiny Tim: ♪ Things that bother you never bother me, I feel happy and fine, aha! Living in the sunlight, loving in the moonlight, having a wonderful time! ♪
[SpongeBob gleefully flies to the vegetable preparation desks, holding the spatula with his mouth. SpongeBob is chopping onions, lettuce and tomato with a spatula.]
Tiny Tim: ♪ Haven't got a lot, I don't need a lot, coffee's only a dime. Living in the sunlight, loving in the moonlight, having a wonderful time. ♪
[SpongeBob walks around a set of ingredients. SpongeBob steps on the pump of mustard, ketchup and mayonnaise on buns.]
Tiny Tim: ♪ Just take it from me, I'm just as free as any daughter. ♪
[SpongeBob dances around in a background with different colors, with the yellow background hiding his limbs]
Tiny Tim: ♪ I do what I like, just what I like and how I love it! ♪
[SpongeBob becomes a number ""1"" followed by ascending numbers up to ""4."" He squeezes a bottle of ketchup and mustard on Krabby Patty to form a smiley face. He adds a patty and the rest of the toppings on top of the lower bun to form a Krabby Patty. SpongeBob serves the Krabby Patty. Some of the anchovies noticed, and one of them caught a Krabby Patty. All of the anchovies look toward the window to anticipate more Krabby Patties. SpongeBob then serves up Krabby Patty after Krabby Patty. He repeats chopping vegetables and serving yet more Krabby Patties. Numerous Krabby Patties are launched through the order window to the hungry anchovies.]
Tiny Tim: ♪ I'm right here to stay when I'm old and gray, I'll be right in my prime. Living in the sunlight, loving in the moonlight, having a wonderful time! ♪ [hums]
[More and more anchovies start eating the Krabby Patties tossed at them. Eventually, all of the anchovies are served and they leave on the buses happy. The bus doors close. Lastly, SpongeBob tosses the final Krabby Patty to the last anchovy. SpongeBob blows the spatula. Cuts to the main room of the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs congratulates SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: That was the finest fast-foodsmanship I've ever seen, Mr. SquarePants. Welcome aboard. [gives SpongeBob a name tag]
Squidward: B-but, but, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for SpongeBob! Hip-hip!
Squidward: [weakly] Hooray, Mr.—
Mr. Krabs: Hip-hip!
Squidward: [quickly] Hooray.
Mr. Krabs: Hip-hip!
Squidward: [quickly] Hooray. Mr. Krabs—
Mr. Krabs: I'll be in my quarters, counting up the booty. [wheels a wheelbarrow piled with an enormous stack of cash to his office. As he walks towards his office, Patrick enters]
Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew!
Squidward: What would you like to order, Patrick?
Patrick: One Krabby Patty, please.
[The instrumental to ""Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight"" starts playing. SpongeBob flies back to the kitchen, using his spatula]
Squidward: What?
[A score of Krabby Patties is immediately fired through the servery, which Squidward dodges, colliding into Patrick and sending him flying out of the Krusty Krab. Cuts to Krusty Krab exterior; crashing noises.]
Patrick: [screams]

Pearl calls for help, and when Mr. Krabs goes upstairs, he sees her growing rapidly. Pearl needs food because she is, as it seems, going through a growth spurt. He finds the fridge, brings it upstairs, and Pearl eats the entire fridge, but it is not enough.After Pearl threatens to eat Mr. Krabs' money, Mr. Krabs sneaks into Mrs. Puff's vegetable garden and steals all of her peanut worms, thinking they are peanuts, to feed to Pearl, but realizes they are not peanuts when they start spitting up on him. Mr. Krabs tries to escape, but Mrs. Puff hits the fence piece Mr. Krabs is on with a crowbar, sending Mr. Krabs flying away from her. He then looks in Patrick's house for food and finds nothing but inedible food made out of sand. Mr. Krabs finds Patrick sleeping in his cereal bowl and steals it. After feeding it to Pearl, she still wants more food.Mr. Krabs then goes into Squidward's house, steals all of his food, and feeds it to Pearl, but she still yells for more. He goes to SpongeBob's house and is about to get some food until SpongeBob notices. Squidward then comes in and angrily explains that Mr. Krabs is a food thief. He is about to call the police and ignores threats of firing him, Mr. Krabs pleas that he will give something. Squidward sarcastically asks if Mr. Krabs will give him his gold tooth, something the latter does after removing. SpongeBob remarks that he had no idea that Mr. Krabs had such a thing and Squidward states he did not either, but takes it anyway and leaves.Mr. Krabs cries and SpongeBob tells him that his tooth will heal. Mr. Krabs is not worried about that since those nerves died years ago. He tells SpongeBob that he needs to feed his daughter. SpongeBob asks why he does not take her to the Krusty Krab, as the latter says that will deplete his inventory. SpongeBob laughs and says he will make one Krabby Patty that tastes like a million.They bring Pearl to the restaurant where SpongeBob feeds Pearl, who not only stops feeling hungry, but stops growing too and is back to normal. Mr. Krabs asks SpongeBob what ingredient he used to make the patty stop Pearl's problem and the fry cook tells Mr. Krabs that love was the secret ingredient.

[sees Mr. Krabs stuck in the fence, trying to escape] There you are, sucker! [throws her crowbar and hits the fence, causing the fence to flip and hit the back of Mr. Krabs. Acting as a boomerang, the crowbar flies back to Mrs. Puff]
Mr. Krabs: [still running] Cucumbers. Squirting me. Flying stuff! [laughing hysterically. He hides in a big rock, only to be revealed that it's Patrick's house. He sees a refrigerator filled with food] Jackpot. [sees Patrick, sleeping with his head on a bowl of Kelpo] Surely Patrick could spare a few morsels. After all, it's for a worthy cause. Me beloved Pearl. [grabs all the food] Don't worry, Pearl, Daddy found you some vittles! [the food is actually sand] Bottom feeders. [sees Patrick and gets the bowl of Kelpo, then runs back to his daughter, exhausted] Pearl! I brought you some-- [Pearl grabs the cereal] ...cereal.
Pearl: [stomach growls] More, Daddy! More!
[cut to Mrs. Puff's house]
Mrs. Puff: [petting a peanut worm] There, there, my darling, the bad man is gone now. And if he comes back, we'll make sure he never walks again!
[two police officers appear]
Officer: Which way did you say the kidnapper ran, Miss, uh, Mrs., uh, Ms., Mrs., Miss, Mrs. [clears throat] So which way did you say he went?
Mrs. Puff: I said he went that way.
Officer: [writes on his notepad for about five seconds] Anything else?
Mrs. Puff: No.
Officer: [writes on his notepad for about five seconds, then taps notepad] Got it. Johnson. [Officer Johnson turns on the flashlight and points it at the fence] Well, looks like whoever it was is gone now, ma'am. Enjoy the rest of the evening. [both walk to their to their police boat] I tell ya, these calls are getting more and more weird. I mean, what kind of nutcase would want to break into someone's vegetable garden at this time of night?
Mr. Krabs: Ooh-hoo-hoo, foo-foo-foo-food. Gotta find foo-hoo-hoo food! [passes the police boat]
Officer: Well, I doubt he's gonna turn up anywhere near here again tonight. What do you say we go check out that new 24-hour taser emporium you were talking about? [drives out]
Mr. Krabs: Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! [passes Squidward's house, then doubles back and sniffs] Food. [uses nose to try to unlock the door. Mr. Krabs sees Squidward sleeping in the bedroom] Not food. [stops and smells the flowers, then continues. He then turns on the light and gasps] Hanging cured meats. Exotic spices. A breadbox overflowing with baguettes. Yummy stuff everywhere! I'll start with the fridge. [opens fridge filled with food] Candied sea yams, pickled urchins, anemone pies, a bucket of kelp slaw.... Et cetera. Ooh, more et cetera. [walks out of the house]
Squidward's house: Oh, well. I needed to lose a little weight anyway.
Officer: [talking to Johnson] And that's what I told him. I said, ""If you're not gonna bring an extra set of batteries, then why even carry a--"" [sees Mr. Krabs carrying a sack filled with food] Hey mister! What's with the sack?
Mr. Krabs: S-sack?
Officer: Yeah, sack. That big giant sack thing you're carrying on your back, that sack.
Mr. Krabs: It's, uh... I'm, uh, practicing to be ""Santy Claws"" for the holidays.
[siren on the boat wails. The police drop Mr. Krabs off to his house]
Officer: Okay, you have a safe night now.
Mr. Krabs: Thanks again, officer!
Officer: Be seeing you in a couple months. [chuckles] Happy Holidays.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, Pearly, I got some vittles for ya! [Pearl begs to put the food in her mouth. Mr. Krabs dumps all the food in her mouth. Her stomach growls that the scene shakes, then, she burps loudly]
Pearl: More!
Mr. Krabs: I was afraid you were gonna say that.
[Mr. Krabs runs to get some food. He sees SpongeBob's house in front of him. Inside, SpongeBob turns on the kitchen light, where he sees Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: I wasn't stealing food!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs! How could you do this to me?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I'm sorry, I had no other choice. See
SpongeBob: Coming over for a slumber party without even giving me a chance to put my best PJs on? I mean, look at these things. Just give me one minute to change, and when I get back, we can get started on some s'mores and popcorn.
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles nervously] G-g-good idea, SpongeBob. That sounds just perfect.
Squidward: Not so fast! That crab is a food thief! He snuck into my house in the middle of the night, stole every last morsel in my kitchen, and he even swiped my entire collection of smoked kielbasas.
SpongeBob: But I thought he was having a slumber party at my house.
Squidward: I don't care. I'm calling the police. [dialing]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, wait, you can't.
Squidward: Oh? And why is that?
Mr. Krabs: Because if you do, I'll fire ya. [Squidward continues dialing] No, if I go to prison, who's gonna feed Pearl?
Squidward: Hello, police?
Mr. Krabs: Hold it! I'll... I'll...
Squidward: You'll what? You'll give me your golden tooth?
[Mr. Krabs sniffles, and yanks out his golden tooth. He gives it to Squidward]
SpongeBob: I didn't even know Mr. Krabs had a gold tooth.
Squidward: Neither did I.
Mr. Krabs: [sobbing] Oh, SpongeBob, what am I gonna do?
SpongeBob: Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I had a tooth pulled a few years ago. Only hurts for a couple of days.
Mr. Krabs: It's not that, boy. Those nerves died years ago. It's me dear daughter, Pearl.
SpongeBob: Pearl? What happened?
Mr. Krabs: She's going through one of them growth spurts, and I can't find a way to feed her.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you're the owner of the most delightfully delicious restaurant in Bikini Bottom! Why don't you just take her there to eat?
Mr. Krabs: Hold on, boy. I said I was trying to feed me daughter, not completely obliterate me inventory.
SpongeBob: You don't have to do that. I know a special ingredient that can make one Krabby Patty taste like a million.
[cut to the Krusty Krab]
Pearl: Oh... oh...! So hungry... not gonna make it!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, hurry it up!
SpongeBob: Hang in there, Mr. Krabs. Almost ready.
Mr. Krabs: You've been saying that for the last-- [SpongeBob appears with the Krabby Patty. The Krabby Patty is put in Pearl's mouth. She burps]
Pearl: Daddy, I'm not hungry anymore, and I've stopped growing. I feel great. Heh, Heh!
Mr. Krabs: Whew! Boy, I'm glad that's over. And it only cost me one Krabby Patty. Say, what was that secret ingredient you used in there, anyways, boy?
SpongeBob: It was love, Mr. Krabs. It was love.

Krabs gives him a mop and tells him not to leave until the place is spotless. SpongeBob starts picking up some trash, but does not get very far and wishes that he had a friend to help him clean up. Suddenly, a magical janitor named Sammy Suckerfish drifts in on the winds to offer his assistance. Through a song, Sammy explains that his preferred cleaning method is by using his tongue to lick the entire place clean. SpongeBob tries to get into it, but he has to have Sammy tie up his nose to be able to handle the taste. They both manage to clean up the entire dining room and kitchen with their tongues.Next, they lick the bathroom clean, but the graffiti on the stall door is really stubborn. Sammy uses his magic soap to turn himself and SpongeBob into graffiti drawings who drive the other graffiti away. Sammy then uses his mop to sniff out other dirt, which ends up being in Krabs' office. He cleans the room by licking up everything, including the safe and secret formula, with the printing of the formula getting stuck to his tongue. While chasing Sammy, SpongeBob accidentally trips an alarm that alerts Krabs, who thinks Plankton is attacking. Krabs arrives and thinks Sammy is Plankton, until the real Plankton shows up and teams up with Krabs to stop Sammy. Sammy splits his mop up into smaller versions and licks everywhere while singing, turning the place even cleaner.SpongeBob and Krabs catch Sammy and point out a spot of dirt on his face. He decides to clean himself by licking up his body, removing everything except his face. Before he goes, he spits out the secret formula from his tongue onto SpongeBob's face and gives him his hat. Plankton takes a picture of the formula on SpongeBob's face, but Sammy's mops eat the picture chase him away. SpongeBob wipes the formula back onto the paper and Krabs comments he hopes it’s clear why he doesn’t want SpongeBob to let strangers in the Krusty Krab ever again. SpongeBob smacks into the extremely-polished doors of the Krusty Krab while walking away and says, ""crystal clear,"" then laughs.",Sammy Suckerfish,"[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab in the evening.

[The camera zooms in on Plankton as it warps into a flashback, where Plankton is seen running to the SquarePants' house.]
Plankton: [laughs evilly as the approaches the house, places a baby basket, throws out the baby, and places himself inside, then rings the doorbell]
Harold: [voiceover as he and Margaret answer the door] We found him on our doorstep this morning.
Margaret: [Plankton is seen sucking on a pacifier while wearing a diaper like a baby]' He was just as cute as a button. [takes Plankton inside, flashback ends]
Harold: And we did what any decent sponges would do and immediately adopted [SpongeBob picks up Plankton] the little foundling.
Plankton: [dizzy, groaning, then shakes his head and points to himself] I'm your new brother!
SpongeBob: Wait a minute.
Plankton: [laughs nervously]
SpongeBob: This is--great! I've always wanted a brother! [hugs Plankton tightly] Ooh!
Margaret: All right, [pointing] you two boys have fun. [kisses Plankton and SpongeBob before leaving with Harold]
Plankton: All right, SpongeBob. [points away] You heard the dopes. Eh, I mean, ""Mommy"" and ""Daddy."" We're brothers now. And brothers tell each other everything. [laughs evilly while rubbing his hands] Especially the Krabby Patty secret formula. [laughs evilly]
SpongeBob: [laughs with Plankton and his parents] You're right, Plankton. There's [wags finger] no secrets between brothers.
Plankton: Yes. Yes!
SpongeBob: But first, we have to get closer by doing things together, like brothers do.
Plankton: [sighs] Eh, fine.
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Plankton playing baseball in the backyard. Plankton is holding a glove while SpongeBob is the pitcher.]
SpongeBob: First up, a little game of catch.
Plankton: [struggling to push the glove] Hold on, hold on! This glove is too big. [gets crushed by the baseball]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Heads up!
Plankton: [lifting baseball, groans] Here. Here you go. [weakly throws baseball]
SpongeBob: Nice throw, Plankton. [pours hot sauce onto the baseball] Now here comes one with a little spice on it. [tosses baseball]
Plankton: [putting hand out] No, wait! [gets crushed by the baseball, gets up while the baseball is his eye] It burns!
[Back inside, SpongeBob's parents holding mugs look outside to see baseballs being thrown.]
Margaret: Oh, Harold, it's so nice to see our boys getting along.
Harold: Oh, it really is, dear. [both sip their drinks]
Plankton: [rolls into place while on the baseball, groans, then rolls over to SpongeBob] Okay, enough catch. How about we share secrets now?
SpongeBob: Sorry, but we [pulls out ""BROTHERLY LOVE"" meter] haven't filled our brotherly love meter yet. [puts back love meter] We have more bonding to do. And what better way to brotherly bond than by helping our neighbors? [picks up Plankton from the baseball]
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob running to someone's house while holding Plankton.]
SpongeBob: I'm sure these nice ladies will have some chores for us to [snaps fingers] do.
Plankton: [sarcastic] Oh, goody. [rings doorbell]
Prunes: [answers door] Whatever you're sellin', I'm not buyin'.
SpongeBob: No, ma'am. My brother and I were hoping you had some [tosses Plankton into the air and catches him with his other hand] housework that needs doing.
Prunes: You two look like a couple of weirdos. And I don't let weirdos touch my stuff!
Mary: [wheels her out] Ma! Give it a rest! Don't mind her. You boys can mow our kelp lawn. [zoom out to their kelp lawn, points right] Mower's out by the tires. Careful. [wheels her mom back inside]
SpongeBob: [salutes] We're always careful, ma'am. [now standing next to a broken lawnmower] Okay, little brother, [Plankton climbs to the top of the lawnmower] you get the motor going. And I'll drive.
Plankton: [tugging on the lever] Hey, can we switch places?
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's cute, but you're not tall enough to work the controls. Now give her a good tug.
Plankton: All right, whatever. [struggles to pull on the lever, then eventually tugs it along the ground and lets go] Whoa!
SpongeBob: [screams as he loses control of the lawnmower as it starts driving on its own, eventually getting spun before losing it] [sees Plankton with the top of his head cut off] Are you okay? You were supposed to be [Plankton puts the top of his head back] careful.
Mary: [wheels Prunes outside as she looks around with her crusty eyes] Mmm. Nice work, I think. [holds out a nickel] Here's a shiny nickel, boys.
Prunes: You're paying for this mess? Quit spoiling them, Mary.
Mary: [flips the coin to SpongeBob and Plankton]
Plankton: A lousy nickel? Why, you decrepit-- [gets crushed by the nickel, which SpongeBob takes]
SpongeBob: [coin shows an anguished Plankton as the President] We're rich!
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Plankton walking on the sidewalk in downtown Bikini Bottom.]
SpongeBob: Okay, next, we're going to head down to the junkyard and play with the [raises finger] metal shredder.
Plankton: No way! I've had it with your torturous activities. [horns honk] I'm--wait a second. [elephant noises] Where are we?
SpongeBob: [points at ""SLIPPIN' PEEL'S SCHOOL O' YUCKS""] Right by the Clown College. Why?
Plankton: We have to get out of here right now. [pointing] Come on! We'll take the long way home.
SpongeBob: What's the matter? You're not afraid of clowns, are you? [laughs, then looks up to see a giant angry clown next to him]
Clown: [turns SpongeBob into a balloon animal, which he tosses away] I thought I told you not to come around here, Shrimp! [pokes Plankton]
Plankton: [laughs nervously] Yeah, you might have mentioned that before, Squeakers.
Mr. Squeakers: That's [pokes] Mr. Squeakers to you. Looks like my [raises foot] big shoes get to stomp a tiny punk today.
Plankton: [whimpers]
SpongeBob: [pops himself back to normal] Brother! No! [gets in front of Mr. Squeakers and gets stepped on, then bounces back to normal to launch him into the air]
Mr. Squeakers: [screaming] No! [bursts into confetti]
Plankton: [pointing at SpongeBob] You--you saved me from that big-footed buffoon.
SpongeBob: Of course. Brothers stick up for each other.
Plankton: I can't believe I'm saying this, but, [rubs head] uh, I think I want to do more stuff with you, big brother.
[Bubble transition to a montage of SpongeBob and Plankton doing things together. A jellyfish is seen above a coral tree, and SpongeBob is on a branch with a jellyfishing net trying to catch it. A jellyfish stings Plankton off-screen, scaring the other jellyfish away. SpongeBob lands on the now inflated Plankton, deflating him. They both laugh. Bubble transition to inside SpongeBob's parents' house, where SpongeBob is trying to reach for a jar of cookies on top of the fridge, with Plankton holding him up. Margaret comes in to scold them, then they all laugh. Plankton gets crushed by SpongeBob, and comes out of him on top. They both laugh again. Bubble transition to SpongeBob walking to the zoo, where SpongeBob and Plankton laugh at a sea monkey's butt. SpongeBob point and laughs while Plankton shakes his own butt. Then, the sea monkey rips off Plankton's butt, of which a close-up shot is shown. They both laugh again, ending the montage. Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Plankton laying on the grass, looking at the sky.]
SpongeBob: [points up] That cloud looks like an elephant fish.
Plankton: [points] That one looks like an iron maiden.
SpongeBob: [points] That one looks like a baby jellyfish.
Plankton: Ooh, [points] that one looks like a depth charge. Thank you, SpongeBob, for a truly wonderful day. [gets up] I had a lot of brothers and sister growing up, but never one who was actually nice to me.
SpongeBob: Little brother, I'm ready.
Plankton: Ready? Ready for what?
SpongeBob: [stands up holding the brotherly love meter] We're real brothers now. [tosses away meter] I'm ready to share my deepest, most secretest [Plankton's pupil turns into the secret formula] secret. [Plankton forms an evil expression] I swore I'd never tell it to anyone. Oh, but I'm nervous. Could you go first?
Plankton: Of course. Anything for my brother. Eh. [pacing] I put on a gruff exterior because I don't want the world to hurt me. But deep down, I'm afraid I'll push everyone away and end up alone. [looks up at SpongeBob, whose sad face is shown in a close-up]
SpongeBob: Well, thanks very much for sharing that, little brother. Now it's my turn. [inhales deeply] No one is supposed to know this, but--but--
Plankton: Yes? [holds out pen and notepad] Yes?
SpongeBob: My tie, it's-- [holds out his tie, which is revealed to be a clip-on] a clip-on!
Plankton: [points with pen] I knew it! Wait, what?
SpongeBob: I never learned how to tie a tie! Look at it! Look at it! [holds tie in front of Plankton and rubs it onto him] Look your eyes upon my accursed shame! [breathes heavily, wipes sweat] Whew, sure felt good to get that off my chest.
Plankton: That's it? That's your secret? [grabs eye] Are you kidding me?
SpongeBob: Yep, that was it. Wait, are you upset?
Plankton: You're darn right I am! You were supposed to tell me the secret formula! Nobody cares about your tie!
SpongeBob: The secret formula? That's what you wanted to hear? Oh, I can't share that. [pokes head] It's locked in my brain box.
[Zoom into SpongeBob's brain box, where a police guard Mr. Krabs is snoring while lounging in front of a safe. Beeping is heard.]
Plankton: Well, then, [holds up chainsaw] I'll use this key to unlock it! [laughs evilly]
SpongeBob: [shrieks]
Plankton: [laughs evilly, then is taken away by Harold, swinging around while being held]
Harold: Oh, boy, I was afraid of this.
Margaret: [holding the basket] It looks like you two just weren't made to be brothers. [shakes head] Such a shame.
Plankton: [Harold places white clothing onto him] Hey, what are you doing?
Harold: Well, the only thing responsible parents can do--making our child someone else's problem. [places Plankton in the basket, then he and Margaret take off]
SpongeBob: [waving] Bye, Plankton. I really liked having you as a brother.
Plankton: Yeah, well, I hated every minute-- [Harold puts a pacifier in his mouth, which he sucks on]
Margaret: [places Plankton in the basket in front of the Star family house, rings the doorbell, then he and Margaret quickly leave]
Bunny: [answers the front door with Cecil] Why, look, Cecil! It's a baby boy.
Cecil: Fantastic! I've always wanted our son to have a brother. Oh, Patrick!
Patrick: [opens the top window and jumps out of it, taking Plankton with him] All right! Let's play checkers! [spits out a checkerboard and hits Plankton against the board repeatedly] Checkers! Checkers! Checkers!

Bubble Bass: I may have made a slight [gulps, camera zooms out] miscalculation.
Dirty Bubble: [falls into the chum, eating it all]
Bubble Bass: [whimpers as the chum rises to the top of him]
Dirty Bubble: [laughs, which gets gradually deeper as he is now a giant bubble of chum; breaks through the ceiling and laughs] This chummy chow will make me invincible. [laughs, then spots a leak of chum from his body] Ooh, leftovers. [licks the chum and swallows, making his body rumble as several spots on his body leak] Huh? [grumbles] Uh-oh. [explodes]
Bubble Bass: [screams and falls to the ground, chum lands on his body, then gets up] Eugh. [takes off a piece of chum] Ew. From now on, [flicks chum] I'll stick to villains who don't control my life.

He sees SpongeBob fancily preparing a Krabby Patty and complements his cooking. After eating the Krabby Patty, the manager thinks that SpongeBob can be his next culinary superstar at his restaurant. He gives Mr. Krabs a fortune of money to take SpongeBob to his restaurant. Despite SpongeBob not wanting to leave the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs finds the manager's offer too good to turn down, as the manager leaves with SpongeBob.At the tryouts kitchen, the manager gives SpongeBob and three other chefs cooking tests to decide who will be his chef at the stadium, with those who are eliminated forced to sell hot dogs on the freeway. The manager first assigns the chefs to cook soup. The sea turtle sabotages SpongeBob and the eel chef, but SpongeBob soon gets the idea to use his tie, and he dips it in his soup. As the manager judges the soups, he eliminates the eel chef after noticing the nails that were poured by the sea turtle as sabotage. At the end of judging, he declares SpongeBob the winner of the round.The manager's next test for the chefs is pizza. The sea turtle apologizes to SpongeBob for sabotaging him earlier, but he proceeds to trick him with a ""special pizza dough"" made of chewed gum. The shrimp chef tries to issue payback to the sea turtle, who threw nails at him prior, by putting nails on his pizza, but the sea turtle notices him. The manager soon proceeds to judge the pizzas and eliminates the sea turtle after noticing the nails on his pizza. The sea turtle declares revenge on SpongeBob while he is eliminated. The manager tastes SpongeBob's pizza, which had the shrimp chef inside. The manager complements the pizza for its unique flavor and declares SpongeBob the winner of the competition.At the Culinary Stadium, SpongeBob prepares to go on. SpongeBob manages to handle the orders with his skills and precision, but unbeknown to him, the sea turtle shows up at the stadium with a timed bomb, attempting to once again sabotage SpongeBob. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs and Squidward arrive and are surprised that only the wealthy customers get to eat the food SpongeBob eats while everyone is forced to sit and watch the show. Now under pressure from time, SpongeBob panics as the food on stage starts to fall apart. Mr. Krabs, in the stands, gives SpongeBob an order of Krabby Patties to help him win. SpongeBob successfully prepares Krabby Patties and serves them to the customers outside the premium seats.The manager stops the competition due to Krabby Patties not fitting his standard of quality food, as SpongeBob forfeits, wanting to go back to the Krusty Krab. Patrick instructs SpongeBob to go back on stage as the crowd cheers for him in the background. The bomb, still active on the stage, explodes, and launches SpongeBob into the stands, as Patrick catches him and reminds SpongeBob of his high status among the customers.",Big League Bob,"[A restaurant manager is driving on the road while on the phone.]
Restaurant manager: Yes, sir, I'm well aware that we need a new super chef [stops in front of the Krusty Krab] for the big, new stadium restaurant. [on the phone while walking inside] I found three potential candidates, and I just need one more, someone with pizzazz!
SpongeBob: [flips a patty in the kitchen, putting it all together on a plate]
Squidward: Huh? [to SpongeBob] Will you cut the pizzazz and finish the order? [grunts]
SpongeBob: [opens a pickle jar, slipping] Whoops! [hits the pickles with his spatula, jumps onto Squidward's head, and leaps into the air, grabbing a rope and catching all the ingredients with a plate; he jumps on Squidward's head again and goes back into the kitchen]
Restaurant manager: [on the phone] Listen, I gotta go.
SpongeBob: [juggling ingredients] Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! [jumps and taps his feet] Ahh!
Restaurant manager: [enters kitchen] Hey, buddy.
SpongeBob: [screams, sending the ingredients flying, then he maneuvers around to catch them all]
Restaurant manager: That's some mighty fancy cooking. Is that my order? [takes the patty and takes a bite into it, gasps]
SpongeBob: Is there anything wrong with it?
Restaurant manager: Is there anything wrong, he says. There's only everything right with it! [tosses patty] What are you doing here in this greasy dump when you could be a culinary superstar in the [eyes turn into stars] big leagues? Who's your manager? Who?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is my manager.
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of the cupboard, sending Krabby Patties flying] What's all the rumpus in here? [points] Who's this clownfish?
Restaurant manager: [holding a piece of paper up to Mr. Krabs] This clownfish is gonna make you a very wealthy crab.
Mr. Krabs: Culinary Stadium Restaurant? What's that?
Restaurant manager: It's a [a miniature version of the stadium appears above them] bold new concept. We've converted a baseball stadium into a restaurant, [the mini stadium opens up] serving thousands of food fans at the same [snaps his fingers to pop the stadium] time. [grabs SpongeBob] So, how much to take this greenhorn, this rookie, this dinghy full of holes off of your claws? Look at him. [close-up of food stains on SpongeBob's tie] Food stains on his tie. [clicks tongue] Deplorable.
SpongeBob: Huh? [licks tie] Not deplorable-- delicious!
Mr. Krabs: I could never part ways with me--
Restaurant manager: [holds up a large stack of cash, as more appears below them]
Mr. Krabs: [takes a dollar and uses it to fan himself, moaning] Oh, pardon my vapors.
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs, [crying] I don't want to leave the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: [holding the stacks of cash] Yeah, far be it from me to hold you back, boy-o. By the looks of this legal tender, it's obvious you're destined [takes off SpongeBob's hat and puts it on the stack of cash] for bigger and better things. [kissing the money stack]
Restaurant manager: [picks up SpongeBob and carries him out] Let's get out of here.
Patrick: [wearing a fedora with a toothpick in his mouth] Hey, kid. Go get 'em, hotshot. Knock 'em dead. [clicks tongue]
SpongeBob: [continues trudging, then briefly stops to see that Patrick has disappeared, with only a gust of wind remaining]
Patrick: [voice only] Knock 'em dead. [clicks tongue]
SpongeBob: Huh?
[Bubble transition to the Tryouts Kitchen.]
Restaurant manager: Okay, you lowly hash slingers. [walking in front of the four contestants, including SpongeBob] This is the tryout kitchen. The four of you will compete cooking against each other. [the eel is sweating and tugs her collar] You'll be eliminated one by one [the turtle bangs his fists and grunts] until there's only one of you [SpongeBob excitedly stands in place] left standing. [the shrimp is filing the ingredients] That person and only that person will cook for the whole stadium and receive the title of [takes off fedora] super chef.
SpongeBob: [reaches out his arm long enough to poke on the restaurant manager's shoulder] What happens when you're eliminated?
Restaurant manager: You'll be [presses on a remote to turn on a monitor] selling dirty water hot dogs on the freeway.
[On the monitor, Fondue Man is seen selling hot dogs on the freeway.]
Fred: [while driving, tosses a can at Fondue Man]
Fondue Man: [gets hit in the head with another can] Oh!
SpongeBob: Looks like fun. [to the turtle] Hello. My name is SpongeBob.
Turtle: [uses a whisker to shake SpongeBob's hand] Put her there.
SpongeBob: [close-up of his now curled fingers] Curly finger fries. [laughs, then inflates his hand with his mouth, which makes him float; he pops it, falls down, then salutes]
Restaurant manager: [banging spoon in bucket] Let's go, go, go, you goofy gourmets. You got your broth, and you got your ingredients. I want to taste a soup that's unique with a flavor that's singular! Let's get [tosses bucket] cooking!
[All of the contestants except the turtle begin chopping up their ingredients. SpongeBob finishes chopping.]
Turtle: [bangs his table to send the ingredients into his pot] Thanks. [laughs] Aw, gee. Looks like you ain't got no fixin's for mix-ins. Ha-ha!
SpongeBob: [jumps onto the table] Hey, that's not fair. [the turtle hits him and turns him into an accordion, laughs] Some romantic dinner music?
Turtle: [to the eel] You know what your soup needs? A little roughage. Let me [pours nails from a box into the eel's pot] ""nail"" it for ya. [laughs]
Restaurant manager: [looks at his watch] Ten seconds left!
SpongeBob: Oh, what do I do? What do I do?
Restaurant manager: [from a thought cloud's flashback] Look at him. Food stains on his tie.
SpongeBob: [pops thought bubble] My tie! [dunks the food stains from his tie into the pot] Dunk, dunk.
Restaurant manager: [bangs pot with spoon, then uses his spoon to slurp some of the shrimp's soup] Hmm. Not bad.
[Several cans start rolling around near the shrimp, for which he uses his foot to push them away.]
Restaurant manager: [tries the eel's soup, then spits several nails onto the turtle's face] Nails are unacceptable! You're out! [uses a remote to make a vacuum appear above the eel]
Eel: Aw. [gets sucked in by the vacuum] Oh! [cut to her wheeling in a hot dog cart next to Fondue Man]
Fondue Man: [whimpers, waves, then gets hit with another can] Oh!
Restaurant manager: [slurping the tie's soup, walks away] Not bad. Not good, but not bad.
Turtle: [manages to smile]
Restaurant manager: [slurps SpongeBob's soup] Excellent! Light, refreshing, with just a hint of rayon! This round goes to the sponge!
SpongeBob: [a golden horseshoe wreath lands on top of him, which causes him to neigh like a horse]
Turtle: [grumbling]
Restaurant manager: Listen up, you grub guppies. The next challenge is pizza! I want a pizza that's extraordinary, unanticipated, from left field-- and no nails. [walks away; the contestants are each seen with a dough ball]
Turtle: [spits nails at the shrimp, pinning him to the wall]
Shrimp: [sighs]
Turtle: [chewing and blowing gum as SpongeBob rolls his dough] Look, buddy, I'm sorry about before. Let me make it up to you. [spits something from his mouth onto a grotesque dough ball, which he holds out to SpongeBob] I've made this special pizza dough from me old mother's recipe. I'd like you to have it.
SpongeBob: Much obliged. [takes the dough, sniffs] Mmm, minty. [begins shaping the new dough]
Turtle: Heh heh. [smashes his fist into the dough, then tosses it and places it on the ground, then walks away]
Shrimp: [at the turtle's counter] So you like nails, do you? [chuckles as he pours nails on the dough, followed by cheese]
Turtle: Huh? Stealing my cheese, huh? [grabs the shrimp by the shirt] I know just what to do with shrimps like you.
[Bubble transition to later, when the contestants except the shrimp have their pizzas ready.]
Restaurant manager: Mm, what happened to the shrimp? I guess some folks can't handle the pressure. Turtle, you're up. [eats a slice of the turtle's pizza, then spits nails out of his mouth onto the turtle] What did I say about no nails? You're out! [presses a button on his remote to suck the turtle in with a vacuum
Turtle: [as he is stuck on the vacuum, to SpongeBob] It had to be you! I'll get back at you if it's the last thing I do! [gets fully sucked in, then wheels in a hot dog cart next to the other vendors, tosses a can at Fondue Man, then gets hit with an anchor by a driver]
Eel and Fondue Man: [laugh]
Restaurant manager: Huh. [picks up the pizza] Unusual shape. [eats the entire pizza at once] Mmm. [smacks lips] Hints of mint, tropical berry, cinnamon. But what's this flavor? [blows bubblegum, which pops and frees the shrimp]
Shrimp: Oh! [falls down, in a fetal position]
Restaurant manager: [laughs] That's it. Shrimp! I love shrimp on pizza! The competition is over. Looks like you hit a home run, sponge. [kicks the counter out of the way as a trophy band lands on him] Welcome to the big leagues!
SpongeBob: [gasps, takes vegetable bouquet, eyes tearing up] Even the dreams that you've never had can come true.
[Bubble transition to the Culinary Stadium.]
Restaurant manager: [over the microphone] Welcome to the Culinary Stadium, food fans. The cooking is about to begin. Food fans, [camera pans downward to a giant silver platter] will you please give a warm welcome to our new super chef, [the platter is lifted up to reveal SpongeBob's kitchen] SpongeBob SquarePants?
[SpongeBob and the restaurant manager are seen behind the stadium.]
Restaurant manager: [grabbing SpongeBob by the hand] That's you, champ. You're on!
Patrick: [as SpongeBob walks past him] Hey, kid. Knock it out of the park. [clicks tongue]
SpongeBob: [continues walking, then looks back to see only a gust of wind remains]
Patrick: [voice only] Knock it out of the park. [clicks tongue]
SpongeBob: Huh? [shrugs] Eh. [walks onto the stadium and into the kitchen]
Restaurant manager: [over microphone] Let's cook! First up, [the mentioned objects all appear on a screen] caramelized kelp, pesto coral, and grilled chocolate algae.
SpongeBob: [chops the ingredients with his hand, which then land on three separate plates]
Restaurant manager: [over microphone, SpongeBob grabs ingredients from the fridge and throws an egg onto the pan with his foot] Oh, the rookie is off to a great start.
SpongeBob: [twirls and tosses the pizza dough with his nose]
Restaurant manager: [over microphone] He's showing excellent form. [SpongeBob uses his foot to open the oven door] Look at the arm on that kid.
SpongeBob: [places the pot into the oven]
Restaurant manager: [over microphone, SpongeBob salts the dishes] Fried sea bananas, [SpongeBob hits the counter to send the dishes flying] the gold flake breadsticks, [SpongeBob kicks the dishes to serve them to the crowd] twigs in a blanket.
Rich people: [murmuring]
Restaurant manager: [over microphone, SpongeBob pours some of the fridge's contents into a blender] Oh-ho, SpongeBob is handling all the orders like a true champion.
SpongeBob: [puts the lid on the blender and holds onto it as it activates and shoots green goop, sending him into the air]
Turtle: [holding ticking dynamite, which he places underneath a table] I told him I'd get him back. [cackles and tiptoes away]
SpongeBob: [flips back into the kitchen, eating the vegetables and spitting them back out into slices]
[The camera zooms in onto Squidward and Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm. Why are there no tables up here?
Squidward: The tables with food are for the wealthy moneybags down below [camera pans over to the fancy fish eating the food] in the premium section.
Mr. Krabs: Hmm. We only get to watch 'em eat?
Squidward: [holds out a pair of binoculars and uses them] I know. Isn't it wonderful?
Mr. Krabs: [takes the binoculars] Give me that. [looking at SpongeBob through the binoculars]
Restaurant manager: [over microphone as SpongeBob cooks] Such skill, such agility! But can he keep up the pace? [buzzer blares]
SpongeBob: [looks up and gasps]
Restaurant manager: [over microphone] The orders are piling up for our rookie.
[The scoreboard moves quickly and catches smoke.]
Mr. Krabs: [using binoculars] Uh-oh. [looks at SpongeBob struggling to cook] Looks like our boy is in trouble.
SpongeBob: [screams as he spills food from his bowl and the oven sets on fire, then slips on the food and screams again as he is on fire; he lands in the sink full of soap]
Restaurant manager: [over microphone, the fridge dumps out all of its contents as it falls down] All food bases are loaded!
Crowd: [booing as Mr. Krabs writes on a piece of paper]
Squidward: What are you doing?
Mr. Krabs: I'm giving [crumples up the paper and turns it into a paper plane] SpongeBob an order I know he can [tosses the paper plane] win with.
Squidward: Let me guess.
Mr. Krabs: Krabby Patties.
Squidward: Typical.
SpongeBob: [the paper plane lands in his eye] Huh? [takes the paper and reads it]
Restaurant manager: [over microphone] Looks like our chef has a special order, folks.
SpongeBob: [jumps out of the food pile and begins making the patties] Whoo-hoo-hee!
Restaurant manager: Wait a minute. [SpongeBob jumps into the food pile] That doesn't look like gourmet food.
SpongeBob: [inhales, spits lettuce onto the bottom buns, then puts patties onto them with a pot and spatula] Whoo! Hey! Ha! Ha! [chops open a bag of buns, of which land on the patties] Wap! Hey! [spins around, throwing patties at the crowd]
Crowd: [eat the patties, cheer and applaud]
Referee: [blows whistle]
Restaurant manager: [as SpongeBob tosses patties] Time out! [snatches a patty] You're supposed to be cooking high-class cuisine, not fast food.
SpongeBob: [shrugs] Yeah, well, [jumps onto the counter] thanks for the opportunity, but I like it better in the Krusty leagues. [takes off his chef hat and gives it to the restaurant manager] I forfeit. [jumps off the counter]
Restaurant manager: Huh, these kids today. [walks off] No respect for the game.
[Cut to SpongeBob walking behind the stadium, and spots Patrick sitting again.]
Patrick: Hey, kid. You're blowing up big-time. Don't you hear 'em? [clicks tongue]
Crowd: [as SpongeBob looks toward the stadium] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
Patrick: Go out there. Take your final bow.
SpongeBob: [runs away and looks back to see Patrick gone again, with only a gust of wind left]
Patrick: [voice only] Take your final bow.
SpongeBob: [scratches head] Where the heck does he go? [runs off happily]
Patrick: [hiding, opens up a floor tile, takes back his toothpick, and closes it again]
SpongeBob: [walking onto the stadium, hops on the counter to take a bow] Yeah! Oh. [laughs] Thank you.
[The camera zooms in on the dynamite from earlier, which reaches its last second.]
SpongeBob: Thank you.
[The dynamite explodes, sending SpongeBob and his kitchen ingredients flying in the air.]
Crowd: [gasps]
Mr. Krabs and Squidward: [looking up] Huh?
Patrick: [moves to catch SpongeBob next to Mr. Krabs and Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: [puts an employee hat onto SpongeBob's head] Our boy's come back to us!
Patrick: Didn't I tell you you were blowing up?
SpongeBob: [elbows Patrick] You sure did, kid. [clicks tongue]",TBD,Kaz

They go inside and meet the security guard, Old Man Walker, who they initially mistake for an exhibit. He lets them in and tells them not to cause any trouble.SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy go to the prehistoric exhibit, which tells the story of how Bikini Bottom came to be. Sandy observes an exhibit and figures out it was due to natural erosion, but SpongeBob and Patrick claim an anchor hit the ground with such force that it caused buildings to erupt from the sand. Sandy points out they are in the anchor that the museum was built in, and realizes their explanation is nonsense.Next, they go to the pioneer exhibit. Patrick rides a rock around, going haywire, and Sandy lassos him. Old Man Walker comes in and reprimands them, only to be crushed by the rock. SpongeBob then explains the pioneers' lifestyle: Mr. Krabs is seen as a farmer milking a sea urchin cow. Suddenly, a gang of cowboys come in, led by Plankton riding on Spot. SpongeBob and Patrick come in as Sheriff Pants and Deputy Star, blowing bubbles to catch the gang members. Krabs opens Bikini Bottom's first restaurant, the Krusty Kreamery. In the present day, Patrick drinks some of the restaurant's now-expired milk.SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy go to the Industrial Revolution era exhibit and find one of the first boats ever made. SpongeBob explains that the first successful boat assembly line was ran by Mr. Puff, but two of his workers, being ancestors of SpongeBob and Patrick, got caught in the machine and assembled into a boat at the hospital. Sandy doubts this until she reads the plaque and Patrick demonstrates that his voice is still used as the horn.They walk into the elevator and SpongeBob sees a ""?"" button at the top floor, so they go there. Along the way, the elevator stops at floors depicting various time periods through SpongeBob and Patrick. When it stops, they walk into a room full of covered inventions and a map for world domination, led by Old Man Walker. Old Man Walker reveals himself, turns his walker into a robotic version, and chases them outside.Suddenly, the museum pulls itself up out of the ground. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy fall into the gift shop while Old Man Walker gets pulled up. Sandy says that the past was too much for her to understand, and is relieved that the present is more normal, until Plankton chases Mr. Krabs on a robot. Sandy then rips up her notebook.",Hysterical History,"[SpongeBob and Patrick are walking Sandy, who is blindfolded, along the sidewalk in downtown Bikini Bottom.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Okay, Sandy. Your surprise is just a few more steps away.
Patrick: [giggles]
Sandy: Gosh, fellas. I can't wait to--
SpongeBob and Patrick: [take off Sandy's blindfold] Surprise!
Sandy: [sees they are in front of the Museum of Bikini Bottom History, gasps] The Museum of Bikini Bottom History? How'd y'all know to take me here?
SpongeBob: You gave us these [holds up envelope] invitations.
Patrick: [chews, holds out envelope with tongue]
Sandy: And boy, am I [grabs SpongeBob and Patrick with her arms] glad I did. [walks with them over to the entrance] I'm just itchin' to learn all about the rich history of Bikini Bottom. And I [holds up notepad and pencil] will be taking notes. My research is gonna be featured in a scientific journal. [holds up magazine] ""The Naval Gazette.""
Patrick: [looking at his belly button with a magnifying] I love gazing at my navel. Hi. [tosses magnifying glass away and pushes SpongeBob and Sandy inside, head still lowered] Well, what are we waiting for?
[They all bump into Old Man Walker, who is the security guard.]
Old Man Walker: Tickets, please.
SpongeBob: [holding up three tickets] Here you go.
Old Man Walker: [slowly reaches for the tickets and finally grabs them] Eh. Let's see here. [counting tickets] One, two, uh, I lost my place. [mumbles]
SpongeBob: [looking at a small sign that says ""Bikini Bottom's OLDEST Security Guard""] Look, the [points] first artifact. ""Bikini Bottom's Oldest Security Guard.""
Sandy: [moves SpongeBob aside] They should dust these [takes her tail and dusts Old Man Walker] old robots.
Old Man Walker: [slaps Sandy] Hey! Can't you read? [gestures to nearby sign] It says ""No Touching!""
Sandy: [giggles nervously] Sorry. Uh...
Old Man Walker: Alright, youngsters, in you go. [wags finger] Now don't cause any trouble, or you'll have to answer to me. [laughs, stammers as he notices the three left already] What? Hello? Eh. [falls asleep on his walker, snoring]
SpongeBob: [entering a new room with Patrick and Sandy] Welcome to the ancient past. Before Bikini Bottom was Bikini Bottom. They say the exhibits here date back at least one gazillion years.
Sandy: Uh, you sure about that math?
SpongeBob: [stupidly] Duh, me do [gives two thumbs up] math good!
Sandy: [shrugs, sketches a brain with a question mark above it, then gasps as she sees a sand mound in an exhibit] Look here, fellas. Millions of years ago, this here land was called Bikini Top. The elevation was lowered due to natural erosion.
Patrick: Ugh. That's not what happened.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Sandy. We'll tell you the true story.
Patrick: Yeah. [waving arms] It goes like this.
[Scene fades to primitive versions of SpongeBob and Patrick on the sand mound, who scratch themselves. Primitive Patrick sucks his arm, and Primitive SpongeBob sniffs his finger after placing it on Primitive Patrick's back.]
Patrick: [voiceover] A gazillion years ago, Bikini Top was hit by a humongous anchor.
[An anchor falls out of the sky and crushes the sand mound and the primitive versions of SpongeBob and Patrick.]
SpongeBob: [voiceover] The anchor flattened the hill to the bottom of the ocean, which is why it's called Bikini Bottom.
Patrick: [voiceover] And then, the anchor was so heavy that a bunch of buildings [buildings pop up near the anchor] got popped up out of the ground.
Primitive SpongeBob: [comes out of his pineapple home and looks around]
Primitive Patrick: [his rock opens as he is seen attached to it, then falls down on his face]
Primitive SpongeBob and Patrick: [yell as the Bikini Bottom sign emerges from the ground]
Primitive SpongeBob: Bikini Bottom?
Primitive SpongeBob and Patrick: [screaming, acting like animals, which then transitions to SpongeBob and Patrick doing the same thing]
Sandy: You mean to tell me the very anchor we're standing inside now is the one that created Bikini Bottom?
SpongeBob: [stupidly bumping heads with Patrick] Uh-huh.
Sandy: [clicks pen and sketches a bull on her notepad] I see. [cow moos]
[Bubble transition to a shot of elevator buttons on a wall. The red one lights up and SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy come out.]
Sandy: Looks like this floor covers Bikini Bottom's [puts cowgirl hat on, horse neighs] old pioneer days.
SpongeBob: Wow. [approaches the rock from ""Pizza Delivery"" and hugs it] A genuine antique rock. The pioneers used to ride these babies for miles.
Patrick: I wanna try! [lands on the rock from above] Giddy up! [slaps rock]
Rock: [neighs and runs around with Patrick on it]
Patrick: Whoa! Hey! Calm down! Whoa! [rock breaks off a statue's head]

Old Man Walker: Hey! [grabs Patrick] No trickropin'! [tosses Patrick and walks away] Darn hooligans.
Rock: [neighs, crushes Old Man Walker]
Sandy: [laughs nervously] Sorry, sir! [runs off with SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: [gesturing to a sea urchin with udders] Look, Sandy. In the old days, the pioneers used to milk [grabbing udders] dairy urchins on their homesteads.
[Fade to Mr. Krabs in a cowboy outfit milking an urchin.]
Mr. Krabs: [whistling]
SpongeBob: [voiceover as milk lands in the bucket] It was a simple, honest life, [Mr. Krabs picks up the bucket and pets the urchin] without an ounce of greed.
Mr. Krabs: Another full pail, Bessie. I reckon I can barter for quite a bit with this. [laughs, then his claw gets a hole and screams] Maybe for some thicker gloves.
Patrick: [voiceover, Plankton appears riding Spot, then three cowboys riding seahorses] But the pioneers have to watch out for those dirty, stinky outlaws.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps as the others circle him and the urchin] Oh, no! It's the Grungy Gang! [stink lines appear from the cowboys] Oh, I knew somethin' smelled fishy.
Hammerhead shark cowboy: [spits]
Plankton: [laughs while floating on Spot] We're here to take that valuable little urchin off your hands. Eh, claws.
Filthy Star: Not so fast, you filthy felons. [pan over to him being ridden by Sheriff Pants]
SpongeBob: [voiceover] Fortunately, Sheriff Pants and [Sheriff Pants pulls out a sugar cube, which he feeds Filthy Star] Filthy Star brought law and order to the land.
Sheriff Pants: [holding bubble wand] We're here to clean up your act.
Plankton: [points] Get 'em, boys! [laughs as he and the cowboys go after them]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [inhale, then blow several bubbles from their wands]
Plankton: [laughs, then gets trapped in a bubble which floats into the sky]
Cowboy: [gets trapped in a bubble] Huh?
Plankton: [all four of them float away in bubbles] Aw, bubbles.
Sheriff Pants and Filthy Star: [exhale into bubble wands]
SpongeBob: [voiceover] And with law came commerce.
Patrick: [voiceover] Thus, [cut to Mr. Krabs hammering in a sign near a shed with bottles] Bikini Bottom's first restaurant was opened. [Mr. Krabs uses a tool to burn text onto the wooden sign] ""The Krusty Kreamery.
Sheriff Pants: [gives Filthy Star a bucket of milk to drink, then gives himself one to drink]

Patrick: Care for some souvenir milk?
Sandy: [putting hands out] Uh, I'm not thirsty. Thanks.
Patrick: Suit yourself. [puts the rotten milk into his mouth, sighs]
[Bubble transition to the trio going to another room via elevator.]
Sandy: I reckon we've stepped into Bikini Bottom's industrial revolutioned era. Wow. [horn honks as she looks at an old boat on display] A Model C boat? [reading plaque nearby] Says here--
Patrick: [honks horn in Sandy's face, which makes her cover her ears; he and SpongeBob are riding the boat] Don't read that, Sandy. We'll tell you the real story. SpongeBob, what's the story?
SpongeBob: Well, Bikini Bottom's old [fade into a scene of a factory, where boats are moving along on a conveyor belt] titan of industry, Mr. Puff, [Mr. Puff walks on-screen] ran the first successful boat assembly line.
[Inside the factory, a worker pulls a lever to start the conveyor belt. On the belt, one worker hits a horn with a mallet, and another blows into a tire. The objects move along, and the workers repeat this process.]
SpongeBob: [voiceover] It was important for every worker to perform as efficiently as possible.
[On the assembly line, SpongeBob and Patrick perform the same work the other workers are.]
Mr. Puff: [blows whistle] Speed up line number five!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [salute] Speeding up line number five!
[The conveyor belt speeds up.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Huh? [struggle to work at the faster pace]
Patrick: [stammering]
SpongeBob: [stammers, gets hit and screams, then grabs Patrick as they bounce along the conveyor belt]
Patrick: [voiceover] Sometimes, they get a little too caught up in their work. Hey, watch this one.
[SpongeBob and Patrick get moved along several cogs.]
SpongeBob: Whee! [laughs] Whoa!
[SpongeBob and Patrick land on the belt on top of each other from above as amorphous blobs.]
SpongeBob: [voiceover] But being the shrewd industrialist, Mr. Puff also owned the hospital next door.
[SpongeBob and Patrick get moved into the hospital via conveyor belt, and come out to form a Model C boat. Mr. Puff jumps onto the boat's seat and honks the horn.]
Patrick: Beep! Beep!
Sandy: Now hold it just a darn minute. [flashback ends, looking at her notebook, and sketches a screw and a ball onto her notebook] Ain't no way these screwball stories are true. Lemme read that plaque. ""Titan of industry,"" ""assembly line,"" ""injuries,"" ""hospital next door."" ""Beep, beep""? Well, twist my tail. Y'all were right.
Patrick: Told ya. [pulls out a horn and honks it, which sounds like him going ""Beep, beep""]
Sandy: [jotting in notebook as they all enter the elevator] I knew Bikini Bottom's history would be colorful, but I'm starting to have more questions than answers.
SpongeBob: [pointing to ""?"" button on elevator wall] Maybe this question mark on the top floor is where you get your [presses ""?"" button] questions answered.
Patrick: You forgot to push these. [pushes all the other elevator floor buttons]
[The elevator closes as they go up the floors. The elevator opens up to see SpongeBob and Patrick in their hippie outfits from ""SpongeBob's Last Stand.""]

Patrick: Uh-huh. I guess this is the ghost exhibit. [claps hands]
SpongeBob: I think it's under construction, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh. I can't wait 'til they put the ghosts in.
Sandy: [gasps upon seeing a large object covered in a cloth] Wait a second. Is this--? [lifts cloth to reveal a contraption with several hands holding denture equipment] A denture applicator? [dentures bite, lifts another cloth to reveal jet boots] Orthopedic jet boots? [lifts another cloth to reveal a laser machine with a bunch of diapers] The atomic adult diaper ray? [diaper ray shoots a laser, which Sandy ducks under] Whoa!
[The laser hits SpongeBob and Patrick, which replaces their pants with diapers.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! [high-fives with Patrick]
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're adults.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laugh as they take off a giant cloth to reveal a ""Future Bikini Bottom"" model, with elderly people and a giant Old Man Walker statue]
Sandy: What in tarnation? [gasps] This ain't no regular future, fellas. This is a future ruled by Old Man Walker!
Old Man Walker: [statue cracks to reveal himself as the statue] That's right, you hooligans. I said, no touching!
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy: Sorry.
[The tennis balls at the end of Old Man Walker's walker fall off to reveal a contraption with sharp blades.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy: [nervously sweating]
Old Man Walker: [being held up by a four-legged blade contraption] You three have seen too much. [begins moving] And now I'm gonna get ya. Stay right there.
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy: [yell and run away]
Patrick: Run! [runs by a cloth that falls over to reveal a googly-eye glasses machine; the cloth covers his face and he runs into SpongeBob]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [scream and bump into Sandy as they fall onto each other]
Old Man Walker: [crawls towards the trio]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy: [fearfully mumbling while walking backwards onto a plank outside]
Sandy: [holding hands out] Please, Old Man Walker. We won't tell nobody about the future.
Patrick: [calling out] Hey, everybody! We've seen the future! But it's a secret! Shh!
[A ship horn is heard as the ground shakes.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy: [yell]
[The anchor begins to rise up as the sign falls down.]
Old Man Walker: Uh-oh.
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy: [yell and fall off the plank, landing through the roof of the gift shop nearby]
Old Man Walker: [shaking fist as the anchor continues rising] Old Man Walker will get you all!
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy walking out of the gift shop. Sandy is looking in her notebook, and SpongeBob and Patrick are wearing souvenir attire.]
SpongeBob: Well, there goes Bikini Bottom's entire past, and future.
Patrick: So, Sandy, what'd ya think?
Sandy: [holds out notebook with a sketch of a nut] I'm still skeptical. Bikini Bottom's past was a bit too nuts for this old squirrel.
SpongeBob: But hey. At least Bikini Bottom is normal now.

They discuss the moon jellyfish, a fable jellyfish that migrates to Bikini Bottom every 25 years. SpongeBob believes in it because of an obviously faked video of Kevin supposedly catching it, and the other people in the group laugh at him for it. He is determined to catch the moon jelly himself to prove its existence.SpongeBob looks for Kevin at the Jellyspotters Clubhouse. There, he finds that Kevin has been kicked out of the group and Patrick has become its new leader. Patrick gives him Kevin's new address, a shack in the woods. He runs into Kevin in the trash can outside, and he confesses that he has no idea how to catch jellyfish anymore. SpongeBob cleans up Kevin and gives him a new outfit, before taking him back to Jellyfish Fields to practice catching them. SpongeBob has to help him, but he eventually gets the hang of it.They return later that night, hiding in the bushes and waiting for the moon jelly to show up. When it does, Kevin suddenly abandons SpongeBob and runs away, saying he does not know how to catch it and the video he supposedly made was staged on a green screen. SpongeBob tells Kevin that this is his chance to catch it and prove he actually is a good jellyfisher. They ambush the moon jelly, but are unable to catch it. They get tired while outrunning it, so SpongeBob comes up with a plan: trapping it by disguising himself as a wedge of cheese to lure it into an alleyway.In the alleyway, Kevin and SpongeBob corner the jellyfish, but clouds begin covering the moonlight and SpongeBob is afraid it will get away. Patrick, the townsfolk, and the others on the Jellyson Group all pull their pants down and show their butts at the jellyfish, reflecting the moonlight and stunning it. SpongeBob leaps onto it and catches it, with Kevin doing the same. However, Kevin cuts off SpongeBob's net and takes all the credit for himself. However, the moon jelly brings Kevin back to the moon, with him not being able to return for another 25 years.",Mooned!,"[The words ""The Jellyson Group"" appear on-screen over a jellyfish background.]
Narrator: And now ""The Jellyson Group.""
Jeff Jellyson: [sitting on a chair] Good evening, and welcome to ""The Jellyson Group,"" Bikini Bottom's best and only show about jellyfishing. My guests tonight are jellyfishing fashion journalist Fabrica Olay.
Fabrica Olay: [sips tea] Hmph.
Jeff: [looks under chair] Famed jellyfish juggler Fish-O the Clown.
Fish-O: [honks horn]
Jeff: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. [reading a piece of paper] And something called a SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [turns around in chair wearing a jellyfish hat and holding a pendant, babbles]
Jeff: Tonight we will be discussing the moon jellyfish. Only seen once every 25 years, will soon be migrating through Bikini Bottom.
Fabrica: [holds finger up] If I can just interrupt, there's no evidence this jellyfish even exists. Has anyone seen it, much less caught it? [sips tea]
SpongeBob: Kevin C. Cucumber, the greatest jellyfisher who ever lived, caught the moon jellyfish. Roll his famous moon catching clip.
[The screen turns to static as a recording of Kevin in Jellyfish Fields plays.]
Kevin: [chasing after a jellyfish with a net, laughs, then catches the jellyfish] I caught it! [screen flashes static] I caught the moon [static flashes again] jellyfish! [in front of camera] I love jellyfishing! [screen flashes static before going back to The Jellyson Group]
Fabrica: That video is a fake.
Jeff: Well, it looked real to me.
Fish-O: [honks horn]
Jeff: That fish is real--
Fabrica: It's a fake! A ruse!
Jeff: You big-shoed buffoon.
Fabrica: Anyone could see it.
Jeff: The moon jellyfish is a fact.
SpongeBob: Stop! It's not fake, and I'll prove it to you by catching the moon jellyfish [crosses arms] just like Kevin did.
Fabrica, Jeff, and Fish-O: [laugh]
[In his house, SpongeBob pauses the footage on the TV.]
SpongeBob: [picks up Gary and sets him down] What did I tell you, Gary? [gets up] Maybe if I can get Kevin to help me, [starts walking backwards] I'll have a chance to catch that moon jellyfish. And I know just where to find Kevin.
[Cut to a shot of the Jellyspotters building.]
SpongeBob: [running to the building] At the Jellyspotters Clubhouse. Ooh. [rings doorbell, which electrocutes him and disintegrates his arm]
Anchovy: Meep? [opens window compartment in door] Meep meep.
SpongeBob: [waves] Hello. I'm looking for--
Anchovy: Meep. [closes window compartment, door rises] Meep.
[As the clubhouse door closes, SpongeBob and the anchovy walk to the throne, where a dark silhouette that looks like Kevin's appears.]
SpongeBob: Kevin, is it really you? [bowing] I'm not worthy.
[The silhouette instead is revealed to be Patrick.]
Patrick: Hey there, Not Worthy. [points to himself] I'm Patrick.
SpongeBob: Patrick? [points] You're the president of the Jellyspotters Club?
Patrick: Sure am. We drew straws, and I was the first one to eat 'em all.
SpongeBob: That's great. Is Kevin Cucumber here?
Patrick: [laughs while eating from a container of straws, pointing] You mean the guy that looks like a nerdy pickle? [pan over to a painting of Kevin running away from the Jellyspotters throwing things at him] He got kicked out of the club years ago and mysteriously disappeared. No one knows where he is. [a Jellyspotter hands him a strip of paper] Huh? [takes the paper] But if you want to find him, [holds up the paper] here's his current address. [spits out a straw from his mouth, chews up the paper, and shoots the wad onto a Jellyspotter]
SpongeBob: [takes the wad and reads the address, shown with a crude drawing of the building, SpongeBob, and Kevin in his house] 123 ""Shack in the Woods"" Lane. [hugs Patrick] Thank you, Patrick.
Patrick: [grabs SpongeBob and lets him go] That's President Patrick to you, Sonny Jim. [SpongeBob leaves, tips straw bucket upside down] Can I get a refill on these?
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob walking in the woods.]
SpongeBob: Well, these are the woods, and this is the only lane I see.
[He sees the shack, and lightning strikes.]
SpongeBob: [walking fearfully] This must be the place. [reaches for the doorknob, but the door opens on its own] Uh-- oh! [peeks inside] Hello? Kevin? You here?
[An eye appears in the dark shack.]
SpongeBob: [screams, the eye is revealed to be from a ragged snail] Oh, phew.
Disembodied face: [groans]
SpongeBob: [screams]
Lady: [the face is revealed to come from a lady, sneezes, holds out a leash] Time for walkies, Miss Marigold. [sees SpongeBob] Huh?
SpongeBob: Um, uh-- [waves] hello, ma'am. I'm looking for Kevin C. Cucumber. Have you seen him.
Lady: Eh, [points over to a trash can] uh--
Kevin: [emerges from the trash can screaming, now with a full beard]
SpongeBob: [flailing arms, screams] Oh, Kevin?
Kevin: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [hugs Kevin] Kevin!
Kevin: [sets SpongeBob down] What are you doing here at my secret forest shame hole?
SpongeBob: Looking for you, [pokes trash can lid] silly. I need some moon jellyfish-catching tips from the master.
Kevin: Master? Ha! I've lost any skills I might have once had. I don't remember how to catch a regular jelly. I don't even remember how to catch a cold. [tries to sneeze, but fails, then sobs from the trash can]
SpongeBob: Well, don't worry, Kevin. [opens the trash can lid] I can get you back in shape. Then we can [uses a tissue to wipe Kevin's tears] catch the moon jelly, and then you'll be on top again.
Kevin: [blows nose]
SpongeBob: Just like the [snaps fingers] old days.
Kevin: You think so? [stands up and tosses the trash can lid, then walks a bit] It's worth a try. Thanks, SpongeBob. This is the best day I've had in years.
Lady: [dumps trash onto Kevin and walks away]
SpongeBob: Um, maybe we'll clean you up first.
[Bubble transition to Kevin sitting in a chair. SpongeBob looks at him, thinking.]
SpongeBob: [tapping foot] Hmm. [shaves Kevin's beard and plucks one of his hairs, and accidentally cuts off his hat, which he haphazardly puts back on after licking it]
[SpongeBob pushes Kevin in a robe and covered in pieces of bloody tissue paper near a ragged curtain. He gives Kevin some clothes to put on, and he drops his robe onto SpongeBob as he appears in his jellyfishing attire. SpongeBob puts a mirror in front of Kevin.]
Kevin: Kevin is back, baby.
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Kevin in Jellyfish Fields.]
SpongeBob: Now that you're looking the part, [twirls two jellyfish nets and gives one to Kevin] let's shake the rust off those jellyfishing skills, shall we?
Kevin: Hmm. [a jellyfish flies by, and he shouts as he tries catching the jellyfish but hits himself in the face with the net, then gets stung]
SpongeBob: Ooh. [seen from Kevin's perspective] Maybe we'll start with something [pinches fingers] a little easier. [pushes baby jellyfish from a hive] Jelly babies. [blows the jelly babies towards Kevin]
Kevin: [swings at the baby jellyfish and misses, then gets stung by them]
SpongeBob: Okay, maybe something a lot easier. [grabs a jellyfish, which stings him] Ow! [jellyfish stings him again] Now, go ahead, Kevin. [gets stung] Ow! Take your-- [gets stung] ow!-- best swing.
Kevin: Mm-hmm. [lifts his net under the jellyfish to catch it] I did it! [runs off to catch several more jellyfish] I'm a jellyfisher again! [laughs, then blows on his net and poses]
[Bubble transition to Jellyfish Fields at night. SpongeBob and Kevin emerge from the sign, then tiptoe ahead.]
SpongeBob: Okay, now for the real deal. What's step one in catching the moon jellyfish?
Kevin: Uh, I know this one. Wait for the moon to come out so we can see it. [yelps as he trips and falls in a bush]
SpongeBob: Ooh, good step one. [twirls his net and jumps in the bush, then both peek from it] Here it comes. [giggles]
[The flower clouds move away from the moon so it can shine. The moonlight shows the moon jellyfish.]
Moon jelly: [buzzing]
SpongeBob: Ah! Okay, Kevin, what's step two? [sees Kevin has left] Kevin?
Kevin: [screaming and running away]
SpongeBob: [chases after Kevin running into Bikini Bottom]
Moon jelly: [chasing SpongeBob and Kevin]
SpongeBob: Tire the moon jelly out by getting it to chase us. That must be step two, huh?
Kevin: There is no step two. I don't know how to catch a moon jellyfish. I faked the moon catching on a soundstage so people would think I was cool.
[Flashback to Kevin faking the moon jellyfish catching. He is seen with a fake jellyfish in his net while standing near a green screen.]
Kevin: I got it! [accidentally swings and breaks the camera equipment] Aw. [stage light falls on him, scene cuts back to him still running, now sobbing]
SpongeBob: [gets in front of Kevin and puts his hand out to stop him] This is your chance to catch it and really be cool. [moon jelly is heard humming] Quick, in here. [throws Kevin in a dumpster, then jumps inside] Whoa! [the moon jelly is seen nearby, both peek out from the dumpster] Our best bet is to surround it. [points left with a half-eaten hot dog] You go left. [points right by squirting mustard onto Kevin] I'll go right. We'll catch it between us. And remember, stealth is key.
[The dumpster lid closes again, then SpongeBob and Kevin jump out to catch the moon jelly.]
SpongeBob and Kevin: [screaming]
Moon jelly: Huh? [lifts its tentacles as SpongeBob and Kevin run around trying to catch it]
SpongeBob: [slips on a banana peel and falls into a trash can] Whoa!
Kevin: [aimlessly swinging around his net and runs int oa police van, which causes its siren to sound, waking people up]
Bikini Bottomite: Some of us have work in the morning. Come on!
Moon jelly: [stings from above]
SpongeBob and Kevin: [scream, dodge the electricity]
All: [looking at the moon jelly as it passes by] Hey, it's the moon jellyfish! [SpongeBob and Kevin chase after it] Look at that. [cheer]
SpongeBob and Kevin: [get repeatedly stung by the moon jelly, then stop, exhausted]
Kevin: I don't think we're going to catch up to that jellyfish, SpongeBob. My knees are getting tired.
Kevin's knee: [wearing a night cap, yawns]
SpongeBob: If we can't outrun it, maybe we can trap it. But we'll need some bait. What would a moon jellyfish like to eat?
SpongeBob and Kevin: Cheese!
Moon jelly: [passes by, then looks in an alley to see a piece of cheese] Hmm? [licks lips, grabs a knife, puts on a napkin, then approaches the cheese]
SpongeBob: [as the cheese, his eyes appear and he puts on his glasses, then turns back to normal] Freeze, moon jelly. [presses button on his net to expand it]
Kevin: [on the other side] Prepare to be caught.
[They both approach the moon jelly, then stop.]
SpongeBob and Kevin: Huh?
[The flower clouds cover the moon.]
Moon jelly: [chuckles, waving as he begins to fade]
SpongeBob: [hand reaching out] We're losing the light! The moon jelly's gonna disappear! Huh?
Patrick: Losing the light you say? Maybe you could use a little moonlight. [pulls down his pants to reveal his big butt, which creates moonlight to stun the moon jelly]
Jellyspotters: [appear] Meep, meep, meep. [show their butts as well to create more moonlight]
Mr. Krabs and Larry: [appear, showing their butts]
Kevin: Look! It's working!
SpongeBob: We need more moonlight! [moon jelly hits the wall]
[Pan up to reveal the citizens of Bikini Bottom showing their butts as well. The three Jellyson Group members appear on top of a building and show their butts as well.
Moon jelly: [rubs its eyes] Huh?
SpongeBob: [screams and leaps at the moon jelly, catching it]
Kevin: [catches the moon jelly as well]
SpongeBob: We caught him! We did it, Kevin. We did it. [Kevin uses a saw to cut the net from SpongeBob, making him fall] Whoa!
Kevin: Sorry, SpongeBob. But there's no we about it. [points to himself] I'm the sole catcher of the moon jellyfish. [laughs as the moon jellyfish flies into the air] Wha? Wait a minute. Where are we going? Where are you taking me? [screams as the moon jelly takes him to the moon, which shines]
Bikini Bottomites: [oohing and awwing]
SpongeBob: Wow.
Patrick: [points] Where's the moon jelly going?
SpongeBob: [puts his arm around Patrick] Home, Patrick. Home. Until it comes back in 25 years, that is.
Kevin: [screams during an open shot of Bikini Bottom]
[Bubble transition to the moon, where Kevin, now with a helmet, is playing Chess with the moon jelly.]

[SpongeBob, Sandy, Narlene, and Nobby emerge from the tractor.]
SpongeBob: What do we do now?
Narlene: Them Planktons can throw all the potatoes in the ocean at us. We've got us something special that'll give us a [bangs fist] decisive victory.
Nobby: [speaking gibberish] Secret weapon.
Narlene: [nodding]
[A metal tower emerges from a giant barrel building.]
Pa Plankton: [with an empty bag] We need more taters!

Planktons: [screaming and running away from the falling shoes]

Narlene: [looking at a shoe box with a giant hole in it] Oh, no. [puts her head in the hole] I'm out of shoes. We plum tossed 'em all.
[The smoke clears up as rhythmic footsteps are heard.]
SpongeBob: What's that sound?
Narlene: I don't rightly know. Sounds like shoes.
[The ground shakes as the rhythmic footsteps continue. A rock gets crushed by a boot as the Planktons appear wearing shoes.]
Pa Plankton: [waving a white flag] We'd like a truce. Ain't no reason Narwhals and Plankton can't share the fields. Besides, we ran out of ammo thanks to your tater-eating city slicker.
Patrick: [with a giant belly, gets carried by Planktons and tossed to the ground, groans]
Narlene: Nice work, Patrick.
Patrick: [weakly] It was an honor [salutes] to serve.
Pa Narwhal: [rubbing chin] A truce, eh? Well, seeing as how we're all out of shoes.
Ma Plankton: You want 'em back?
Ma Narwhal: Oh, heck. You can keep 'em. Besides, we ain't found much use for 'em.
[Several narwhals hold up their grotesque bare feet as they wiggle them.]
SpongeBob: What happens now?
Narlene: The annual post-feud party.
SpongeBob: Annual? You mean you do this every year?
Narlene: [pats SpongeBob's head] Sure do. It's fun. Why, didn't y'all have fun?
Sandy: We did not have fun. [wraps her arm around SpongeBob] We had...

He realizes how much customers are willing to pay for breakfast and gets the idea to start selling it at the Krusty Krab. He asks SpongeBob to cook up some breakfast foods, and he comes out with pancakes, which ends up tasting just like Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs then sends SpongeBob to the cookstore to pick up a cookbook he ordered. However, the clerk mistakenly gives him an ancient spellbook. The witch who was supposed to get it then stops by, but ends up with the cookbook instead.SpongeBob arrives back with the spellbook and is able to find all of the eldritch ingredients in the kitchen, and cooks them in an iron cauldron. A stack of pancakes pops out. Mr. Krabs makes Squidward taste them, but they cause him to grow an extra eye. SpongeBob serves breakfast to the rest of the customers, which all have side-effects and transform them into monsters.Meanwhile, the witch is mixing potions with SpongeBob's spell book, but only makes breakfast instead. Back in the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob explains that his food is transforming the customers. The witch arrives to get her spellbook back, but it floats out of the kitchen and forms part of a giant breakfast monster. The witch tries to attack it, but it sprays maple syrup at her and sticks her to the wall. She transfers her magic to SpongeBob, telling him that the only way to stop breakfast is with dinner. SpongeBob uses his spatula to serve up a triple-decker Krabby Patty and flings it into the monster's mouth. It explodes, freeing the customers who were trapped inside.The witch gets free and offers that SpongeBob can be her apprentice. SpongeBob declines and offers the witch a patty, but she comments it is too early for dinner. She makes it a breakfast food by putting it between two waffles. Mr. Krabs likes the new ""Krabby waffles"" and gets the idea to now serve a combination of breakfast and dinner. He shows the new cookbook, which he picked up himself. It is again possessed, leading to a giant skeleton appearing from the sky and ghosts invading the restaurant.",Necro-Nom-Nom-Nom-I-Con,"[The episode opens with an exterior shot of Bikini Bottom, then the scene cuts to Mr. Krabs walking with his bowl of money tied to a leash and on a wooden plank with wheels. The money sniffs a fire hydrant and Mr. Krabs stops walking, then he notices a nearby breakfast shop. The camera pans to ""Coffee Bowl,"" where various customers are eating breakfast.]
Customer #1: [takes a sunny side up egg with a fork and eats it] Mmm-hmm! I just love breakfast! [bites into the plate as if it's a sandwich]
Customer #2: [plugs his fork into three large pancakes and stuffs them into his mouth, to which he swallows one briefly after the other] I don't mind overpaying if it's [hands the waiter money] breakfast!
Mr. Krabs: [touches the waiter's money] Ooh, that money looks tasty!
Waiter: Do you mind?
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Sorry! All these people eatin' breakfast is makin' me hungry! Hungry for more customers, that is! [chuckles and winks at customer #2]
Waiter: Speaking of customers, [spins her foot wearing a boot] stop bothering [kicks Mr. Krabs away to The Krusty Krab] mine !
Mr. Krabs: [lands backfirst in front of his restaurant] Well, that sure kick-started my day!
[SpongeBob and Squidward walk up next to Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Morning, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Good morning, Krusty crew! I have a fantastic idea for me restaurant.
SpongeBob: [with a thought bubble of the Krusty Krab on the moon] We're opening a Krusty Krab on the moon?
Squidward: We're closing down forever? [the Krusty Krab in the thought bubble explodes]
Mr. Krabs: What? No! [Squidward now has a disappointed expression] From now on, the Krusty Krab will start servin' breakfast. And you two get to come into work even earlier!
Squidward: Hmm?
[The scene cuts to them entering the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! I get to make Krabby Patties for breakfast!
Mr. Krabs: No, no, no, no, no. People don't want patties in the morning! They want bacon and eggs and hash browns! You know, breakfast stuff! See if you can whip up a stack of pancakes, boy-o! [slaps SpongeBob from behind]
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! [dashes to the kitchen and cooks for a brief moment then jumps out of the order window holding a plate of pancakes and places the plate on a table]
Mr. Krabs: [holding Squidward by his shirt] Give it the old mouth test, Mr. Squidward.
[Squidward slices a triangular part of the pancakes and gives it a taste.]
Squidward: These pancakes taste like a Krabby Patty.
[A closeup of a Krabby Patty shaped into a pancake with syrup and butter is shown.]
SpongeBob: Oh. I guess I only know how to cook Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I was afraid of this. Go down to the bookstore and pick up the breakfast cookbook I ordered. You need to expand your repertoire a bit, boy-o.
[Bubble transition to a bookstore simply named ""Books,"" and SpongeBob walks towards it. The scene then cuts to SpongeBob approaching the front counter with the clerk reading a book.]
SpongeBob: Hello! I'm here to pick up a cookbook for Mr. Krabs.
Clerk: Well, of course, sir! [chuckles goofily]
[The clerk looks at the cookbook on the left, then a Necronomicon book on the far right - then keeps looking between the two until his left pupil collides into his right eye, then hands SpongeBob the Necronomicon.]
Clerk: Here you go. [chuckles goofily]
SpongeBob: [takes one good look at the ""cookbook""] Uh, are you sure this is the right book?
Clerk: Looks right to me! [chuckles goofily]
[SpongeBob walks outside of the bookstore looking at the Necronomicon and accidentally bumps into a witch who was trying to go inside.]
SpongeBob: Whoops, pardon me! [he walks away and the witch enters the bookstore]
Witch: What a polite little hunk of cheese. [cackles] I have a book on hold, last name Witch, first name Evil.
Clerk: Certainly. [takes a look at the shelf and one of his pupils calls the other to join it] Must be [grabs the breakfast cookbook] this one. Your book, ma'am!
Evil Witch: I forgot my spectacles. Hey buddy, you sure this is the magic book I ordered?
Clerk: [shrugs] Pretty sure.
Evil Witch: Huh? If you say so. [ignites a fire with her hand, then she disappears, leave a tiny flame behind]
[The bookstore catches on fire as a result of the flame catching.]
Clerk: Uh-oh!
[Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab with a ""NOW SERVING BREAKFAST"" banner on top of the restaurant and a ""We Now Serve BREAKFAST!"" banner next to it. A line of customers spreads outside the restaurant and SpongeBob walks in.]
SpongeBob: I got the cookbook, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Hurry up, boy-o. Breakfast don't last all day, you know!
[SpongeBob salutes and dashes to the kitchen. He opens the Necronomicon book and reads aloud the page names as he turns the page.]
SpongeBob: Love potions, summoning demons, the undead and you. [turns to a breakfast page] Oh, breakfast! [reading a recipe name] ""Stacks of woe."" [snaps fingers] That must mean pancakes. This book sure calls for some weird ingredients. [pops from the order window] Mr. Krabs, do we have any zombie teeth, dragon's breath, eye of newt?
[Squidward looks at SpongeBob with a concerned expression all the while Mr. Krabs looks at his customers with an uneasy expression.]
Mr. Krabs: Well there should be some in the back of the freezer.
[SpongeBob dashes away off-screen.]
Squidward: Really?
Mr. Krabs: What? I can't pass up a sale.
SpongeBob: [walks out of the freezer with the ingredients in a box.] Found 'em! [opens the book and reads a direction] ""Must be cooked in an iron cauldron?"" Ooh, classy. [walks up to a dresser] I think there's one in here somewhere. [opens up a very long drawer] Oh, there you are! [grabs the cauldron and places it on wood, lights the wood on fire with a match, and places a blue crab's arm, a bat's wing, eyeballs, worms and a green hand into a boiling green substance, then stirs it all together with his spatula]
[A green skull cloud comes out screaming, and a plate of pancakes comes out of the cauldron flying with a green glow.]
SpongeBob: Oh, they're glorious. [walks out of the kitchen with the plate of pancakes]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, looks tasty. [plucks a fork into a pancake] Mr. Squidward, you're up again! [shoves the pancake into Squidward's mouth, to which he swallows]
Squidward: Say, these are pretty good!
Mr. Krabs: Breakfast is [holds up the plate as the camera pans to a bird's eye view of the inside restaurant] served! [everyone in the line cheers as an eye pops up on Squidward's forehead]
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob serving oatmeal to a customer.]
SpongeBob: Your oatmeal, sir.
Customer: [takes a spoonful] Mmm! Deliciously bland. [green tentacles grow from his head as it crawls away, but he continues eating the oatmeal]
Bubble Bass: [in his Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy pajamas] I woke up before noon for this ? Where is my morning sustenance?!
SpongeBob: [walks up with a plate of waffles] Your waffles.
[Bubble Bass grabs the entire plate and devours it.]
Bubble Bass: A meal most toothsome. [swallows] Time to pay for my repast. [he reaches for his back pocket for the money but it [the back pocket] turns into a mouth and bites Bubble Bass' hand] Ow! Egad, my hindquarters have gone rogue!
[Lady Upturn slices a jam-covered bagel and bites into it, resulting in her head and butt to grow wings and fly away.]
Lady Upturn: I am beyond offended.
[A husband takes a bite of waffles and turns into a waffle werewolf, and he howls. The camera pans to a lady taking a bite of a cinnamon roll and her body turns into one in resemblance of a snake, and she hisses. The camera pans to a customer biting into a cream bagel, to which he turns into one and rolls into one. SpongeBob walks out of the kitchen with a parfait.]
SpongeBob: Who ordered the par- [notices the customers' conditions] ...fait? [A shot of all of the customers freaking out is shown]
Squidward: [eyes grow around his body] Of course.
[Mr. Krabs bursts out of his office and sees the cream bagel customer being chased by Bubble Bass' butt.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! What the ham and eggs is goin' around here?!
SpongeBob: [walks up to Mr. Krabs with the parfait] Oh, I don't think I've got the hang of this breakfast thing, Mr. Krabs. [the parfait grows legs and runs away from the platter]
[Bubble transition to the Evil Witch's house.]
Evil Witch: [reading the directions on Mr. Krabs' cookbook] A cup of milk? Two eggs? A loaf of bread? And kelp sugar? Eh, all right. [puts the ingredients in a cauldron] Shoo. [a plate of French toast floats up] French toast? [taps her wand in the green substance and hash browns, quiche, and huevos rancheros float up] Hash browns? Quiche? Huevos rancheros? What the heck?! What's wrong with this blasted spellbook?! [grabs the cookbook and reads the name] ""Uncle Jimmy's Breakfast Magic""? It's a cookbook! Oh... I better find out who got my spell book, and fast. [the plate of quiche bumps into her arm] Huh? Right [the wand transforms into a fork] after I finish my quiche.
[Bubble transition back to inside the Krusty Krab, where the customers are still in the breakfast transformations with SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs in worry.]
Squidward: Why is this happening?!
SpongeBob: Maybe all the weird stuff I've been cooking caused all of this. [Squidward looks at him unamused, and SpongeBob chuckles nervously] Would explain the [the Necronomicon book flies out the order window] cauldron too. [points to the Necronomicon flying] And the flying cookbook.
[The cookbook flies to the front of the restaurant and emits a green light, which grabs various breakfast items to create a body.]
SpongeBob: [as the cookbook forms the items into a body] The cookbook is using tasty breakfast treats to create a monster!
[The cookbook roars and everyone in the restaurant screams. The Evil Witch appears with a purple cloud emit.]
Evil Witch: Oh, so this is where my spell book went.
[The breakfast monster kicks barrels and a table away, breaks off another table and throws it at SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs - which they duck.]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, a customer! Take her order, Squidward.
Evil Witch: Uh, thanks, but I couldn't eat another bite! [belches] I'm here to swap books with ya. I think my spell book got mixed with your cookbook. But first, I better take care of this foodie fiasco. [casts lighting with her hand] Flippity floppity, food!
[The breakfast monster creates a waffle shield and blocks the attacks. Maple syrup emits from the monster's mouth and it sprays some at the witch.]
Evil Witch: [gets splashed by the syrup and hits a wall] Ah Not maple syrup! I'm sticky. So sticky! Hey you, the spongy kid with the wand!
Squidward: That's a spatula.
SpongeBob: My wand!
Evil witch: Well, I'll lend you some of my [ignites lighting from her wand] magic! [the lighting hits SpongeBob, which transforms him into a wizard] The only way to stop breakfast is with its mortal enemy -- dinner!
SpongeBob: Oh, I can do dinner. Pippity poppity pot roast! [a pot of vegetable stew appears, and he hits it at the monster]
[The breakfast monster floats up and clouds and winds surround him. He grabs Bubble Bass, Lady Upturn, four other customers, and Squidward into his mouth.]
SpongeBob: No! Squidward is not part of a balanced breakfast: a triple-decker Krabby Patty...
[The breakfast monster roars at him.]
SpongeBob: ...with [the sandwich appears] cheese! [hits it with his spatula] Wah!
Breakfast monster: [the sandwich propels into the breakfast monster's mouth, and he swallows it.] Mmmm!
[Suddenly, the monster starts making goofy poses and explodes. The spell book falls onto the floor and spits everyone back out.]
Squidward: [groans as SpongeBob fades back to normal] I need a vacation...
[The Evil Witch grabs her spell book.]
Evil Witch: Hey kid, [hands SpongeBob the correct cookbook] do you wanna be my apprentice? [SpongeBob takes the cookbook] You got a real knack for magic!
SpongeBob: Thanks, but the only magic I need is the delicious taste of a Krabby Patty.
Evil Witch: [shrugs] Eh. [opens the Necronomicon and takes out a patty] A patty? It's a little early for me. Unless... [puts two waffles in between the patty and takes a bite] Mmm, a Krabby waffle. [disappears with purple clouds]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, a Krabby waffle, eh? I have another brilliant idear! We will no longer be serving breakfast! From now on, the Krusty Krab will be serving ""brinner.""
SpongeBob: Oooh, the breakfast-dinner duo!
Mr. Krabs: And this time, I picked up the new cookbook myself.
[The ""cookbook"" is actually a possessed ghost book that forms into a face. Mr. Krabs drops the book and green lighting emits into the sky with dark clouds and a green portal forming. A giant skeleton with green hair comes from the portal and green ghouls comes from his mouth and into the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, we've got customers!

She appreciates it, but points out that Plankton always gets stepped on whenever they dance together. To prevent this, Plankton puts himself through his newly-invented Leg Yanker Five Zillion, stretching out his legs to make him much taller. They attend their first lesson, along with SpongeBob and Pearl, and Slappy and Slippy. Their dance instructor, Suzie Groove, has everyone practice the tango. Plankton and Karen are unable to get the hang of it until Suzie teaches them to use their hips and tap into their aggression. Plankton and Karen sabotage the other dancers, which Suzie approves of. She declares them great at the tango, but not her best.Bubble Bass and Mama Bass enter as a tango duo, and have a dance-off against Plankton and Karen. The Basses win, knocking the Planktons out of the building. Karen wants to go home, but Plankton assures her they need to cheat and find a way to be more aggressive. Plankton's Ray Ray ray falls out of his pockets, and Karen uses it on him to turn him into his dancing alter-ego. They go back into and do an even more impressive dance, beating the Basses and having Suzie declare them their new best students. During his finisher, Plankton moves so fast that his legs burn and go down to their usual size. Karen gives Plankton a kiss, but he gets electrocuted and the Ray Ray ray falls out of him. It blasts everyone in the room, turning them into Ray Ray, as Plankton and Karen express their worry to the viewers.",Tango Tangle,"[The episode opens with an exterior shot of the Chum Bucket.

Karen: Oh, Sheldon. This has been the best birthday I've ever had. [picks up Plankton to kiss him, which electrocutes him]

Karen: [takes envelope and rips it apart] Oh? [laughing]
Plankton: [moving eyebrow] It's a gift certificate for tango lessons.

Plankton: Yeah? Oh, yeah? [gets stepped on]

Plankton: Yee-haw! [gets stepped on by a cowboy boot]

Karen: It did not go well.
Plankton: [jumps and runs off] This time is gonna be different.

Karen: [making a "":0"" face] Ooh.
Plankton: Hmm, nice weather up here. [losing balance, then Karen catches her as she smiles] Whoa.
Karen: Well, hello, tall, green, and evil.
Plankton: May I have this dance?

SpongeBob: Love the new stems, Plankton. [winks, then loses balance and falls] Whoa!
Plankton: [as his watch beeps] It's 8:00 p.m. already. Where's our dance instructor?
Suzie: [off-screen as everyone looks in her direction] Hello, class! [enters from a door as she begins dancing, does the split, and stops in front of everyone]
All: [cheers and applause]
SpongeBob: [jumping and cheering, grabs onto Pearl and continues cheering]
Pearl: [sighs]
Suzie: I'm your tango instructor, [moves head back and forth] Suzie Groove. And when I'm done with you, [takes off hoodie] this is how you gotta move. [tango dances with her hoodie, then tosses a rose to SpongeBob with her mouth]
SpongeBob: [catches rose with his mouth, blushes and giggles]
Suzie: [places her hoodie on a clothing rack] So, everyone start dancing, and I'll come around and give you some tips.
SpongeBob: [bouncing around as Pearl looks unimpressed]
Suzie: [makes SpongeBob stand up] You're breaking the first rule, honey. It takes [holds up two fingers] two to tango.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Miss Groove. Mr. Krabs ordered me to be Pearl's [twirls around] tango partner tonight, but she [struts legs] just doesn't dig my tangy moves.
Pearl: [points] SpongeBob, you can't tango. I need a real dance partner, not a cackling, bow-legged goofball. No offense.
SpongeBob: [legs tied together like a bow] I take it as a compliment. [laughs while plucking his legs]
Suzie: I can teach [gives thumbs-up] anyone to tango. All you gotta do is... [starts tango dancing with SpongeBob, then exchanges him to Pearl]
Pearl: Wow, you can tango. [begins tango dancing with SpongeBob] Thanks to Suzie Groove.
Slippy: [laughing as she merges together with Slappy]
Suzie: [approaching] That's too close to tango. [separates the two and holds a stick between them as she begins to tango dance with them, then sets them off]
Karen: [tango dancing with Plankton, who is sweating and struggling to keep balance] One, two, three. One, two, three. Relax, Sheldon.
Plankton: I'm trying, my little whirling dervish, [gesturing to his legs] but these legs have minds of their own. [his legs hit him in the face and butt] Not that way, you idiots. [hits his legs with a stick] Down, mule! Hya!
Karen: Compose yourself, darling. We're in public.
Plankton: Huh? I know. I just need something to balance me. [grabs a rose from a vase with his mouth] See? It works. [losing balance] Uh-oh. Wait, I got it. [accidentally sticks his leg in Pearl's blowhole, which she blows to release his leg, which goes out the now-broken window] I got it! [his leg goes through another building's window steps on an open stove in a different building, which makes him scream and retract his leg, which returns to the building and gets caught by Suzie]
Suzie: Stop dancing!
Plankton: [losing balance again as Karen sadly grabs his legs, then he falls over] Ow.
Karen: Sorry, Suzie.
Plankton: [shrugging] I just washed my legs, and I can't do a thing with them.
Suzie: [as Plankton stands up and tries to keep his balance] Legs ain't your problem, honey. If you want to tango, you got to learn to dance with your [moves hips] hips.
Plankton: With my lips? [live-action close-up of him moving his lips] This isn't working.
Karen: [eyes roll off her screen] Ugh.
Suzie: That's because I said hips! Watch me. All you got to do is... [moves hips]
Karen: Wow, your hips are so hip. You got your work cut out for you, Sheldon.
Plankton: My hips can't do that.
Suzie: Of course they can. You got to force them to do it. [holds onto Plankton and Karen] The tango is physical, [dances with Karen] emotional, and most importantly, [pushes the two out of the way] aggressive.
Plankton and Karen: What?
Plankton: Aggressive? [grinning evilly with Karen] Now you're talking my language.
Karen: Yeah, we speak fluent aggression.
Suzie: Good. Tap into that aggression and put it in your [flexes arm] hips. Now, abrazo. [slams hands together] Embrace!
Plankton and Karen: [grabbing onto each other] Abrazo.
Plankton: Ready? [aggressively dancing] All you gotta do is...
SpongeBob: [dancing with Pearl] Terrific tangoing, Planktons.
Pearl: Yeah, I thought we were good.
Plankton: Aw, how nice of you to say. [twirls Karen into SpongeBob and Pearl, sending them backwards and creating an explosion as he laughs with Karen]
Slippy: [dancing with Slappy] Abrazo, my stinky cheese. [laughs]
Slappy: Abrazo, my rotten rose.
Karen: [holding a spike strip] Oh, no, I accidentally dropped [drops the spike strip behind Slappy and Slippy] my spike strip. Oopsie.
Slappy: [steps on the spike strip, making him and Slippy both deflate like a balloon around the room and crash into a piano] Ow!
[Slappy and Slippy get up, and their teeth have merged into a piano. A tune plays.]
Slappy and Slippy: [giggle and blush, then sigh]
Plankton: [swinging while dancing with Karen] We're the king and queen of tango.
Suzie: [approaching] Okay, Planktons, take four. [gets slammed into the wall] Ahh! [rolls onto the ground]
SpongeBob: [holding onto Suzie] That wasn't very nice of Plankton and Karen.
Suzie: [brushing herself off] No, it wasn't, but [places her arm onto SpongeBob] that's the tango, honey.
Karen: [laughing]
Suzie: [applauding] Bravo, Planktons. Nice aggression.
Karen: Oh, thank you, Suzie. I haven't had this much fun since I got defragged.
Plankton: I'd say we're the best in the class, [Karen nods] wouldn't you, Miss Groove?
Suzie: I think you're great, but my top students might disagree.
Plankton and Karen: Top students?!
Suzie: [looking at her watch] Yeah. They're late today.
[The lights go out as Bubble Bass and his mother arrive in formal attire. A spotlight shines onto them.]
Bubble Bass: The tango masters have arrived.
Mama Bass: Sorry we're late. Bubble Bass needed clean underwear.
Bubble Bass: [blushing] Mother!
Plankton: Bubble Bass and his mom?
Bubble Bass: [moves butt] That's right. Mother and I have won the Undersea Tango Championship [holds up three fingers] three years in a row. We're the best.
Plankton: But yet somehow, and without warning, [yelling] we're the best!
Suzie: [getting in between the two pairs] I smell a dance-off.
Bubble Bass: [gesturing as they all move] Insects first. Hmph.
[Plankton and Karen begin dancing with each other.]
Plankton and Karen: Ta-da! Well, try and out-tango that.
Bubble Bass: Don't mind if we do. [begins dancing with his mom as Plankton and Karen move out of the way]
Plankton: [Karen has a ""!"" on her screen] Huh? [both growling as they begin dancing again] I said we're the best. [knock Bubble Bass and his mom out of the way] Abrazo.
Bubble Bass: [he and his mom squish Karen and Plankton] Looks like someone ordered a Bass sandwich.
Karen and Plankton: [yelling as they bounce around the building and end up outside the building on the ground]
Karen: [getting up] Well, that was fun. But I guess we're not aggressive enough to be the best.
Plankton: [getting up] Nobody is more aggressive than us. [a ray gun drops to the ground] They just have more practice. If only there was some way we could cheat [Karen sighs] and show them who's really the best.
Karen: Let's just go home, Sheldon. [picks up the ray gun] Here, this fell out of your pocket.
Plankton: [eyes the ray gun and takes it] Ooh, it's my Ray-Ray ray, [looks at the camera] the device that turns me into my alter ego with great hair, Ray-Ray. That'll make me more aggressive.
Karen: [takes back the ray gun] Ooh, you're right, Plankton. [looks at the camera with big, goofy smile] My Ray-Ray is the only one who could take charge of this. Hold still. [Plankton holds still as her shaky aim shoots Old Man Walker with the ray instead, turning him into Ray-Ray]
Old Man Walker: [walking with confidence as he tosses away his walker] It's Ray-Ray, baby!
Karen: Oops. Sorry, wrong old man. [shoots Plankton with the ray, turning him into Ray-Ray]
Plankton: It's Ray-Ray, baby.
[Cut to Karen and Plankton breaking through a window in the recreational building.]
Plankton: [pointing] Looks like someone ordered a cold plate of revenge.
Karen: With extra humiliation.
Bubble Bass and Mama Bass: [hissing like cats]
Suzie: Tango rematch, honey.
[The two pairings begin dancing. Bubble Bass and his mom try to tackle Plankton and Karen, but miss. Bubble Bass whimpers as Plankton and Karen's dancing sets the room on fire.]
Plankton and Karen: [laughing]
Mama Bass: [yelling while holding Bubble Bass]
[Karen kicks the pair to the wall, who is left in awe as they fall down.]
Suzie: Whoo!
Karen: [laughing with Plankton] Go, Ray-Ray, go!
Bubble Bass: I want to hate the Planktons, but they're so good. [cries]
Mama Bass: [comforting her son] Oh, there, there, there.
SpongeBob: He dances like an angel.
Pearl: Of death.
Suzie: By the tango vested in me, I pronounce Karen and Ray-Ray my [gets on top of Bubble Bass and his mom] top students, honey.
Karen: [still dancing with Plankton] We did it, Ray-Ray. We're the best.
Plankton: Happy birthday, Karen-cakes, top of the world. Now for the big finish. [his legs begin to shrink] Oh, no. Too. Much. Friction! [ends up spinning on the floor with no legs] My--
Fred: [covers Plankton's mouth] My legs! Sorry, that's my line.
SpongeBob: [holding up his legs while on a skateboard] Here, Plankton, you can borrow my legs.
Plankton: No, thanks. Mine are growing back already. [Karen picks him up] Thank you, Karen.
Karen: It takes two to tango. Come here, Ray-Ray. [kisses Plankton, electrocuting him]
[The Ray-Ray ray falls out of Plankton's pocket, causing everyone to be turned into Ray-Ray.]
All: The name's Ray-Ray, baby.

Patrick realizes he wants his own pet too, so he and SpongeBob go to the pet store. Patrick looks into an aquarium and sees his pet: not the animal inside, but a giant rock decoration. He drags the rock, which he names Rolly, on a leash to the park and plays with it. A geode collector, Percival Rockhound, outside sees Rolly and decides he must have it so he can crack it open. When Percival asks Patrick about Rolly, Patrick thinks he wants to play and ties him up with the leash.Patrick goes home and watches TV, and him jumping on the couch causes Rolly to roll around the house and wreck his furniture. He calls SpongeBob, who suggests that he feed Rolly. Patrick feeds him some cement mix and he grows bigger. SpongeBob tells him to take Rolly for a walk and to use the bathroom. Patrick drags Rolly downtown, leading him to run over a trash can Percival was hiding in. He notices how dirty Rolly is, calls SpongeBob, and sees a rock grooming place nearby. It turns out to be a trap by Percival, who is trying to open Rolly for himself. When he chisels Rolly, it rolls off and crushes him. Patrick likes how Rolly looks after being groomed.Patrick calls SpongeBob again, who suggests that Patrick now take Rolly to the pet show. Patrick fails to impress the judges, but Rolly's uncontrollable rolling knocks the other contestants out, leading Rolly to win by default. Percival attacks Patrick and takes Rolly, smacking it with a briefcase to open it. Rolly hatches to reveal that rather than a rock, it was a dinosaur egg. Rolly grabs Percival and then swallows him whole. Patrick hugs the dinosaur, who swallows him whole too. One of the judges gives the dinosaur the first-place ribbon, and Patrick cheers from inside his stomach.",Pet the Rock,"[The episode opens with a closeup of a direction sign to a pet park, then the camera pans down to SpongeBob walking Gary with Patrick.]
SpongeBob: [holding a frisbee] I'm glad you can come to the pet park [tosses the frisbee to Patrick, to which he catches with his mouth] today, Patrick.
Patrick: [speaking with the frisbee in his mouth until SpongeBob takes it out] Well thanks for inviting me! I can't wait to see Gary's new tricks!
[Gary meows, then opens his mouth to reveal a stack of cards, to which he plays around with briefly before putting it back in.]
SpongeBob: There's nothing more fun than bringing your pet to a pet park!
Patrick: [coming to a sudden halt] SpongeBob! [his head forms into a lightbulb, then shatters. His head regenerates, and he babbles goofily] I got one of those head things!
SpongeBob: A concussion?
Patrick: Yeah. But also the other thing.
SpongeBob: Oh, a thought!
Patrick: Yeah! I think I'd like to have my own pet to bring to the pet park!
SpongeBob: That's a great idea! We can stop [the camera pans out to them next to a pet store] at the pet store on the way!
[The scene cuts to the two walking inside with various pets around them.]
SpongeBob: Mm, do any of these pets pique you fancy?
Patrick: No. [looks at a tank with jellyfish] Uh-uh. [looks at a cage with sea bunnies] Nope. [notices something off-screen] Oh! [dashes onto a cage with a Puffy Fluff swimming around and sits on a rock] That one! [removes his face off the glass, then bounces in place] I want that one, that's the pet for me! [chuckles goofily]
[The shop owner arrives with a net, as if to fish the Puffy Fluff out of the tank. Bubble transition to SpongeBob walking Gary to the pet park. He shows Gary to a guard.]
Guard: [removes sunglasses] Huh. Alright, go on through.
[SpongeBob and Gary walk into the park, then Patrick walks to the entrance.]
Guard: [stops Patrick with his hand while in a goofy position] Hold it right there! I'm gonna need to see some proof of pet.
Patrick: Of course! [holds up his ""pet,"" which is just a rock]
Guard: [takes off his sunglasses] That's a rock.
Patrick: Yeah! His name is Rolly!
Guard: I don't see how this thing is a pet?
Patrick: [tosses Rolly onto the guard's face] Oh, here! Take a closer look!
[Rolly rolls off the guards face, and the guard falls down.]
Guard: Oh, yes, [gives thumbs-up] he's adorable! Go right in! [face falls flat]
Patrick: Thanks. [chuckles] Come on, Rolly! [clicks tongue and releases Rolly to the ground, which lands on the guard's back of his head, and as he [Patrick] walks into the park, Rolly leaves a trail behind.]

[The scene cuts to a rock collector walking with tools]
Percival Rockhound: Oh, geode hunting is a [hits a rock with a hammer and chisel] cracking good time! [chuckles as the rock cracks open with jewels inside it] The perfect crystal quartz lattice! An exquisite specimen for my collection. [slams a suitcase into the ground and opens it with tons of jewels inside. He places the newly cracked rock on top of the jewels and attempts to close the suitcase, but it doesn't close. After a few attempts of trying to close it shut, he hears something]
Patrick: [off-screen; chuckles] Rolly, you're the best rock ever!
Percival Rockhound: What the [pulls out binoculars] devil? [in his POV, he sees Patrick bounding Rolly around with his butt] By Jove! [the rock gets tossed into the sky] Such majesty! [eyes turn into a circled jeweled geode] It must have quite the geode inside! [laughs]
[The scene cuts back to Patrick playing with Rolly, until Percival Rockhound appears.]
Percival Rockhound: Tally ho, good [offers Patrick a handshake] chap!
Patrick: [turns around and swings his rock, almost hitting Percival] Hello!
Percival Rockhound: [grabs Patrick's hand with two of his and shakes it] Percival Rockhound. Amateur geode enthusiast.
Patrick: You talk funny! [chuckles goofily, and holds his rock up] Huh? [puts his rock on his face] What's that, Rolly? Uh huh. [drops Rolly] Rolly says he wants to play with you! [swings the leash in circles] Here you go! [throws the leash at Percival while still holding the end part, causing Percival to get tangled by the leash] Have fun, [drags the leash which is still tangled around Percival] you two!

SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick! Where's Rolly?
Patrick: Oh, and he's playing with the funny mustache man over there!
[The camera pans to Percival tangled with Rolly in his mouth, then he spits the rock out just for it to land on his belly.]
Patrick: Aw, so cute! But that's enough play, Rolly! [yanks the leash, which causes Percival to spin around as he gets untangled] Yah! Ooh.
[Rolly hits many pet owners as Patrick spins the leash around the park, and eventually he loses grip and Rolly dashes off-screen and explodes.]
Patrick: Woah, Rolly! You wanna play with [the camera pans out to the pet owners injured all around the park] everyone today!
[An on-fire plane falls to the ground behind the park and explodes. Rolly falls from the sky and lands in front of Patrick.]
Patrick: Done already? [picks up Rolly] Oh, who's a good boy?
SpongeBob: [chuckles nervously] Uh, Patrick, maybe we should leave.
Patrick: Good idea, SpongeBob. Everyone here is sleeping anyway. Come on, Rolly! [he and SpongeBob walk off-screen]
Percival Rockhound: [emerges from the ground] I will tear that rock asunder. [chuckles evilly]
[Bubble transition to Patrick's house.]
Patrick: What a fun day. [cut to the inside of Patrick's rock] Now it's time to do my favorite thing! [leaps to his sand couch] Nothing! [molds sand into a bowl of popcorn and chuckles, then eats some of it and turns on the television.]
Announcer: [while the theme song is playing] It's the Sir Urchin and Snail Fail show!
[Patrick laughs while jumping, and his velocity causes Rolly to bounce off the couch. The rock touches the lamp which causes it to tip over with Rolly on it, cause the rock to break various items and decorations. Patrick eventually notices the destruction of his house and calls SpongeBob on a sand phone. The scene cuts to Gary pulling out tied handkerchiefs out of one of SpongeBob's side pores with his teeth. The phone rings and SpongeBob answers it.]
SpongeBob: SquarePants residence.
Patrick: [his split-screen corner slides on-screen] Oh, SpongeBob, I don't think Rolly likes TV. He tore up the place.
SpongeBob: Have you been feeding him? Pets get cranky if they don't get their food!
Patrick: Oh yeah! [chuckles] Thanks, buddy!
SpongeBob: Of course. [his split-screen corner slides off-screen]
Patrick: Rolly! [slides a bowl next to Rolly] SpongeBob said you need lots of food! [the camera pans out and he now has a bag of cement] Good thing I had this big bag of cement mix on hand! [rips it open and pours all of the mix onto the bowl; reads an instruction on the back] Just add water. Hm. [pulls out a glass cup from his head and swishes it, then pours the water onto the mix, and walks away] Bone apple teeth, Rolly! [the scene cuts to a sand table, and Patrick falls onto a seat with a bib and a fork and knife] Now it's time for my lunch! [pours cement mix onto his plate and delves his mouth into the mix] I like it dry! Huh?
[Rolly appears next to Patrick much bigger.]
Patrick: Woah! Rolly, you got big! [punches a hole in the wall and grabs a telephone from it] SpongeBob?
[The scene cuts to SpongeBob's house with Gary still pulling handkerchiefs from SpongeBob's pores]
SpongeBob: Yes?
Patrick: [from the phone] I fed Rolly, and he got big! [SpongeBob blinks twice] Is he dying?
SpongeBob: No, you silly! He probably needs a walk to go potty! But make sure he wears his leash!
Patrick: Okay! [the scene cuts to Patrick's house] Time for a walk, Rolly! [jumps off of his rock] The world is your toilet!
[The rock closes and Percival Rockhound hops on the weather vane and pulls out his binoculars.]
Percival Rockhound: My word, how rotund his rock has grown. I must pilfer that plump pebble.

Patrick: Oh! What stinks?! [the camera pans out to reveal a trash-covered Rolly] Oh, it's you, Rolly! [a foghorn is heard as more fumes from Rolly are released] Hmm. [pokes his forehead] What am I supposed to do? [grabs a banana that was on Rolly and presses on it like it's a phone. It briefly rings and the caller picks up] Hi, SpongeBob!
[The scene cuts to SpongeBob on a covered object with a white mat on it.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick! [Gary bites on the mat and pulls it away, revealing nothing under it]
Gary: Ma-meow!
[The scene cuts back to Patrick, and he takes a whiff at Rolly]
Patrick: Rolly smells like garbage water. Is he mad at me?
SpongeBob: Da-ha, of course not! [Gary passes a fire hoop through SpongeBob twice] You can take him to a pet groomer to freshen him up!
Patrick: [with the banana in between his head; he takes it out] Oh! [looks to his left] ""Conveniently Placed Rock Groomer."" Oh there's one right here! Thanks, SpongeBob! [presses the banana and eats it]
[Patrick enters the shop with Rolly but the latter's size causes it to not enter the shop. Patrick pulls the leash with all his might and Rolly breaks through. He takes a seat in the waiting room.]
Percival Rockhound: [off-screen] Good day, sir! [walks from a room with two tied-up employees] I'm the rock groomer! May I take that [climbs on Patrick] ample, [grabs hold of the rock] glorious, collectable rock from you? [Patrick yanks him away from the rock] Woah!
Patrick: Rolly needs a [drops Percival Rockhound] bath! [pushes Rolly with all his might until the rock rolls over Percival and rolls over to the grooming room and onto the table]
Percival Rockhound: At last, the glimmering contents of your sturdy aspects shall be [pulls out hammer and chisel] mine! [tries to chisel the rock but it rolls a bit to the right then starts rolling over. Percival tries to run away, and the scene cuts to the outside where crash and destruction can be heard]

Sandy: Yeee-haw!
Mayor: Contestant 24?
Patrick: Huh? [looks around, then realizes] Oh! [pushes Rolly, then jumps on it belly-first and chuckles as Rolly rolls to a stand. He then claps and barks like a dolphin and falls over eventually] His name is Rolly! Isn't he pretty?
Mayor: What does it do?
Patrick: I'll show you! [lifts Rolly but he loses his strength and the rock bounces off of him off-screen, to which Patrick follows]
[The scene cuts to Patrick lifting Rolly over a hurdle, then cuts to Patrick holding out a birthday care with a lit candle.

[The scene cuts to Rolly rolling over Incidental 69, two worms, and Incidental 82, then rolls in a circle and back to the stand.]
Patrick: Ta-da!
Incidental 16: [somewhat nervous] Well, it seems like every other contestant has been... eliminated!
Third judge: I suppose you win... [Incidental 16 puts a first-place ribbon on Rolly] by default.
Patrick: We.... [a close-up of the ribbon is shown, then the camera pans to him holding Rolly with a firework background] did it! Rolly, you're the best rock- [gets hit by a suitcase]
[Percival Rockhound runs to the stand to hold Rolly.]
Percival Rockhound: Ever! [as he cackles, he hops over Patrick and takes his suitcase] Finally! Your crystalline cache is all mine! [jumps and hits Rolly with his suitcase]
[As Rolly cracks open, light is seen inside the cracks.]
Patrick: Rolly! Oh no!
[The camera pans out and as the rock cracks open, the light bursts out of it.]
Percival Rockhound: Ooh! [dashes to the cracked open rock and takes a peek inside of it]
[Suddenly, a giant dinosaur comes out of the rock, revealing that he was an egg the whole time.]
Percival Rockhound: Oh, go-good show, old chap...
[The dinosaur chomps Percival, swings his head around and opens his mouth.]
Percival Rockhound: Oh, fiddlesticks! [gets eaten by Rolly]
Patrick: Rolly! I love your new look! [Rolly bends down, and he hugs Rolly's nose]
SpongeBob: [comes out of a hole with Gary; tears up] Aw! So, Rolly was an egg all along! [Gary meows]

Squidward: [puts magazine down] Don't ask me. [points at  kitchen window] Ask SpongeBob.

SpongeBob: Oh, but Mr. Krabs, [pulls down calendar] the official employee calendar says it's... [the 8th day is circled, and a heart with ""Mom Day"" written in it and an arrow sticking through it is written on] Bring Your Mom to Work Day.
Squidward: Ha, too bad I forgot. [waves hand] Boy, that would have been awful.
Mr. Krabs: [shivers] Oh, it shivers me timbers to think what a disaster my mom would make if she was here. [both laugh]
Squidward and Mr. Krabs: [laughing]
Betsy and Mrs. Tentacles: [off-screen] Ahem!
[Mr. Krabs' mother, Betsy, and Mrs. Tentacles are standing next to Margaret.]
SpongeBob: [walks next to Margaret] Don't you worry, fellas. I invited your moms too.
Mr. Krabs: What? [strained] How thoughtful of you, SpongeBob.
Mrs. Tentacles: Well, we're here, [grabs Squidward's head] so stop your horseplay and show me what you do. [walks him out]
Squidward: Mother, you're embarrassing me. Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Mr. Krabs: [laughs, Betsy grabs his head and spins him around, then grabs him]
Betsy: I don't know what you're chuckling about, Eugene. There's wasted money everywhere I look! [sticks her finger in the deep fryer and tastes it] When was the last time you changed the oil in this fryer?
SpongeBob: We change it every day, ma'am.
Betsy: [points at him] Waste! Should be but once a year. [tastes ketchup, spits it back in] Real tomato ketchup. Waste! I bet in your latrine you use two-ply toilet paper.
Mr. Krabs: Ha, we use [holds up one finger] one -ply.
Betsy: As if it grows on trees. Waste! It should be half -ply. Your profits would be much higher if you stopped spending willy-nilly.
Mr. Krabs: [looks down] Yes, Mama.
[Cut to Squidward at the register boat. His mom comes up to him.]
Mrs. Tentacles: Remember to smile, son.
Squidward: [growls, forces a smile]
Old Man Jenkins: [walks to register] Where's my food?
Squidward: [still smiling] I'm sorry for the delay, sir. Your order will be up soon.
Mrs. Tentacles: I didn't say lose your disdain.
Squidward: [growls, leans forward]
Mrs. Tentacles: And don't slouch. You'll ruin your spine.
Squidward: I'm an invertebrate, Mother!
Mrs. Tentacles: [duct tapes his back to a board] And no back talk.
Squidward: [forced smile, unhappy] Yes, Mother.
Mrs. Tentacles: Nice disdain. But save it for the customers.
Squidward: [sighs]
[Margaret comes out of the kitchen with a tray that has a potted flower, Krabby Patty, and fries with lettuce.]
Margaret: [humming] Order up for Old Man Jenkins. One Krabby Patty with crust removed and one side salad.
Old Man Jenkins: I ordered fries, not a salad!
Margaret: The fries are in the salad.
Old Man Jenkins: Okay, I'll try it. [takes it] But only 'cause I'm so hungry. [tastes it, spins around and is now wearing a kid outfit] Aha!
Customers: Ooh!
Old Man Jenkins: It reminds me of my mother's cooking when I was but a boy. I'm filled with childish glee! [giggles and skips away]
Margaret: Mm! [smiles, walks away, revealing SpongeBob behind her back with a tray of Krabby Patties]
SpongeBob: I made everyone's orders! [spins the tray to send Krabby Patties into customers' mouths]
Customers: [catch food]
SpongeBob: My mom doesn't understand fast food--not the way I do. Her cooking takes forever, because she adds love.
Brown fish: [eating patty, then stops and tears up] You mean there's no love in this Krabby Patty? Now all I taste is the fast. [stands up on table, throws patty at Old Man Walker] I demand a refund!
Customers: [hold up signs, angry clamoring] We want a refund!
Mr. Krabs: [exits kitchen] Okay, that's enough. There'll be no refunds. You see, there is love here. My love for your money! [heart thumps, kisses dollar bill] Mwah. [holds bill closer] You don't want to break us up, do ya?
Customers: No, we don't! / Where's the love? / Give me my money back! / No love, no purchase!
[Mrs. Tentacles scratches her fingernail against a blackboard to get everyone's attention.]
Mrs. Tentacles: Clearly, our sons aren't working hard enough. Believe me when I say no one is more disappointed than we, their mothers.
Margaret: We thought we taught them better.
Betsy: To avert this disaster, we're going to take over the restaurant and show our boys how it's done! [shakes fist]
Mr. Krabs: But Mama!
Betsy: Zip it! [points] And to the shame corner with you three.
SpongeBob, Squidward, Krabs: Aww... [they walk under a sign labeled ""Shame Corner"".]
Mrs. Tentacles: Now, time to spruce this place up!
[Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab sign, which now reads ""Mama Krabs Home-Style Cooking"" with an illustration of Betsy holding a pie.]
Mr. Krabs: ""Mama Krabs Home-style Cooking""? [looking out window] This is gonna be a disaster. Look at what they did to me restaurant! [the interior is decorated with tiled floors, fancy curtains, and general homey decorations]
SpongeBob: I think the place looks [hugs self] homey.
Mr. Krabs: If I wanted [makes air quotes] ""homey,"" [points backwards] I'd stay at home! [despairingly] This is costing me a fortune. [cash register dings]
[Margaret comes in carrying two large stacks of plates as Betsy holds the door open.]
Betsy: Actually, Mrs. SquarePants had all this stuff in the trunk of her boat.
Margaret: [moves plates] A mother is always prepared!
Mr. Krabs: [sneakily] Eventually, our moms will crash and burn. And then we'll reclaim the Krusty Krab.
Squidward: [smiles] Looks like it's gonna happen sooner than later. Look who just [squishes SpongeBob down and points] arrived!
[Bubble Bass knocks the door open with his stomach.]
Squidward: Bubble Bass!
Mr. Krabs: Every mom's nightmare!
Mama Bass: [holds out a Mermaid Man action figure] Bubby, you forgot your doll on the boat.
Bubble Bass: Mom! It's an [takes it back] action figure, not a doll!
Mr. Krabs: We're doomed.
Betsy: [seating Mama Bass and Bubble Bass] Welcome to Mama Krabs'. Right this way.
[Bubble Bass puts the Mermaid Man figure on the other open chair.]
Betsy: [gives them menus] Here's your menus.
Bubble Bass: Interesting. [looks at menu] We shall see if this new management can stand up to [points to self] my scrutiny. [closes eyes, holds up finger] I will have one of every-- [Mama Bass slaps his menu out of his hands] huh? Ow!
Mama Bass: We'll both have the early-bird special.
Bubble Bass: Mother, I'm going to get a soda. [slams fist on table and runs to soda machine, fills soda and hums happily, puts a straw in it, gets caught by a grabber] Hmm? [yelps, gets pulled back to Mama Bass with a leash, exasperated] Mooom!
Mama Bass: [drops Bubble Bass in his seat, picks up straw] Soda straws are dangerous. You'll put your [pokes his eye with it] eye out. [puts a rubber baby bottle cap on the soda cup] Use this instead.
Bubble Bass: [excited, gasps] Ooh! Ba-ba! [hides it] I mean, uh, so embarrassing. [burps, leans against table]
Margaret: [walking up, holding food] Here you go!
Bubble Bass: Ooh!
Margaret: Two Krabby Patty casseroles. [places them, Bubble Bass and Mama Bass smile] I even cut it into bite-sized pieces.
Mama Bass: That's just how my boy likes it.
Margaret: Enjoy! [walks away, they start eating]
Squidward: Of course that mama's boy would like it here.
SpongeBob: [nervously] Uh, guys? [happy] Look!
[Many happy customers are in the restaurant, either seated or waiting in line.]
SpongeBob: It seems like everyone is liking it here!
Customers: [contented chatter]
[A man trips and spills his food, which Margaret vacuums up and gives him a new one. Mrs. Tentacles, at the register, has a half-full tip jar and spits on a napkin, then wipes a customer's cheek.]
Mrs. Tentacles: You've got some smudge.
Brown fish: Danke! [puts lots of money in the tip jar]
Mr. Krabs: I don't believe it. They're a success!
SpongeBob: Well, of course they are. Look how hard they're working.
Squidward: I actually feel kind of guilty seeing them do all the work.
Bubble Bass: [drinking soda from lid] How pathetic. You three clearly don't know how to appreciate the [hugs soda cup] smothering embrace of motherly love.
Squidward: [leans forward, grumpy] And what do you suggest?
Bubble Bass: Are these premises equipped with a basement?
[SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, Squidward, and Bubble Bass go down to the basement.]
Mr. Krabs: All right, here we are. [turns on lights, shows a bunch of junk in the room]
Bubble Bass: Gentlemen, I present, [grabs SpongeBob and Squidward] the fortress of solitude for [leans towards them] adult children. [jumps over the stair railing]
Squidward: It's a junk-filled basement.
Bubble Bass: Oh, you see ""junk."" I see-- [drapes sheet over some crates and a chest, pushes up a chair]
SpongeBob: [gasps, bounces off couch and onto chair] A hangout lounge!
Bubble Bass: Correct.
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's better than the shame corner.
Squidward: I guess.
Bubble Bass: [relaxes on sacks] Down here, you can spend your time doing whatever you want. Reading comics, playing video games, [mimes typing something and sending it] complaining on the Internet. [dolphin chirps]
Squidward: Your life choices are lame, but I like the overall concept. [Squidward and Mr. Krabs sit down]
Bubble Bass: And with your mother upstairs, snacks are just a holler away.
SpongeBob: Ooh, my mom loves to make snacks. What else can you teach us, oh [makes ""OK"" signs with fingers] wise sage of the [relaxes] slacker ways?
Bubble Bass: [sits up] Alas, my time with you is at an end. [points to self] I have been a good boy, and my mother is taking me for ice cream in three, two, one... [yelps, gets pulled back by the leash] I'm ready for my ice cream, Mommy!
Mama Bass: [leaves] Bye, girls!
Betsy: Come back soon, you hear!
[Cut back to SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs and Squidward in the basement.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I guess we can give it a try. [clears throat] Mo-om!
[Live-action nachos fall down the screen to show SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs playing a video game. Mrs. Tentacles comes in and puts a bowl of popcorn downstairs.]
Squidward: [groans, moves controller]
[Squidward throws his controller and Mr. Krabs celebrates.]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs]
[Transition to Krabs and Squidward playing darts. Krabs throws one. SpongeBob is taped up to a dartboard with an apple on his head, and he moves his legs to avoid the dart. Transition to them all playing a fantasy board game.]
Mr. Krabs: [calling out] Mom! Nachos!
[Betsy comes in and brings them nachos, to their delight. Transition to SpongeBob and Mr.  Krabs having a pillow fight. SpongeBob's pillow flies and hits a pillow fort, which Squidward comes out of.]
Squidward: Hey, watch the fort!
[Betsy, Margaret, and Mrs. Tentacles come down and up the stairs with various snacks as their sons call out for them.]
SpongeBob: Mom!
Mr. Krabs: Ma!
Squidward: Mom!
SpongeBob: Mom!
Mr. Krabs: Mom!
Squidward: Mom!
SpongeBob: Mom!
[Margaret puts a plate of toaster pastries on a crate. Mrs. Tentacles puts a bowl of popcorn on a barrel. The moms fill cups of lemonade and put baby bottle caps over them.]
Mr. Krabs: Mom!
Squidward: Hey, Ma!
[A clock fades from evening to morning. SpongeBob is sleeping on a barrel, Mr. Krabs is asleep on the couch and Squidward, who has drawings on his face, is in a sleeping bag.]
SpongeBob: [snoring] Mom.
Mr. Krabs: [snoring] Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.
Squidward: [snoring] Mommy, Mommy.
[They all wake up.]
Mr. Krabs: I've never slept better in me life. Last night made me feel like a kid again.
Squidward: [exhales] So that's what it's like to have a childhood.
SpongeBob: Aww, you guys are the best buddies a kid could ever have.
Mr. Krabs: [stomach rumbles] I'm hungry. [calling out] Mom, breakfast!
[Shot of the stairwell. It's empty, as crickets chirp.]
SpongeBob: Guys, I think something's wrong.
Mr. Krabs: Agreed, lad. We better go check.
[They open the kitchen door to see a bunch of dads: fixing the clock, playing football, playing cards, napping on a recliner, carving a canoe, grilling, and hanging out with a pickup truck. One dad throws a football at his son, and a buff guy tackles him.]
Tackled guy: [teeth fall out, raises fist] Booyah!
Mr. Krabs: What in tarnation? Who are all these bums?
Harold: Hey, kids!
[SpongeBob's, Squidward's and Mr. Krabs' dads are sitting in chairs and watching TV.]
Krabs Senior: Oh, there you are, Eugene. Go fix me one of those Krabbity Patties you're always going on about.
SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Dad?
SpongeBob: Oh! [pulls up calendar] That's right! [on the calendar, Mom Day is crossed off and Dad Day is circled on the 9th, with an illustration of a car on it] Today is Bring Your Dad to Work Day.
Harold: [holds out drink] Oh, uh, while you're up, son, could you refill my drink?
Jeff Tentacles: [holds out bowl] And more chips for me, kid.
Krabs Senior: Any time you're ready with that Krabbity Patty, son.
Mr. Krabs: I want my mommy!

When Patrick starts laughing, SpongeBob laughs along with him; the years of excessive laughing cause SpongeBob's funny bone to get stuck in high gear, making him laugh uncontrollably. His laughing annoys the rest of the moviegoers and the usher kicks him out. SpongeBob cannot stop his laughing and tries to hold it in, but this does not work.As SpongeBob tries to go back home, he sees a man wearing a funny hat and laughs, mistakenly offending him. He then laughs at a milkman crying over spilled milk. The next day, he goes to work and tries to stifle his laughter. He runs into Squidward and laughs at his face, and locks himself in the storage room so nobody will hear him. However, the vents carry his laughter into the dining room, making everyone leave. Mr. Krabs comes in and tells SpongeBob to stop, but Lady Upturn and Fifi enter, angered that nobody has taken their order. Fifi swipes a patty from the grill and Lady Upturn is pulled by her, making SpongeBob laugh. Mr. Krabs kicks him out, although SpongeBob claims he is not laughing on purpose. Fifi attacks him and he leaves the restaurant.SpongeBob runs through town, laughing. He locks himself in a dark building, hoping that there will be nothing to laugh at, but he ends up in a hospital operating room. As a doctor operates on a robot, his tears of laughter short circuit the robot and make it attack the doctor and nurse. He runs away and finds himself unable to stop laughing, deciding to go to the cemetery so nothing will make him laugh. However, he ends up at a clown funeral, which he finds funny. The supposedly dead clown comes to life, making SpongeBob laugh. He leaves but trips over a stand with a flower wreath. It makes the clown sneeze and his nose explodes, and SpongeBob runs away laughing.Hours later, SpongeBob's laughter has made his mouth take up his entire face. He sees a movie called Weep playing in theaters, which consists of people crying, and decides to watch. However, he starts laughing, driving the patrons away. He runs into his grandmother, who claims that she also got her funny bone stuck at SpongeBob's age, and it happens to everyone in the family. Accepting that laughter is a part of his family, SpongeBob sits next to his grandma and laughs at the movie with her. Patrick is crying at the movie, but only because he ran out of popcorn.",Don't Make Me Laugh,"[The episode begins with an open shot of Reef Cinema. Inside, SpongeBob and Patrick are walking up to the front desk.]
SpongeBob: I love going to the movies. The sticky floors make me feel grounded.
Patrick: I can't wait for you to see this movie, SpongeBob. It's the funniest thing I've never seen in your life. [chuckles] There's this part where this guy... [laughs]
SpongeBob: [to vendor, holding up two fingers] Two combos, please.
Patrick: Is wearing a hat. [laughing]
SpongeBob: [sticks bare foot into Patrick's mouth] No spoilers, Patrick.
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick getting into their seats, stepping on the sticky floors. The movie starts, and a black and white title card appears that says ""PRUDENCE IN LOVE.""]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] ""Prudence in Love""? That doesn't sound funny. Patrick, are you sure we're in the right theater?
Patrick: [laughs] Shh! [grabs SpongeBob, then points at the screen]
[On the screen, a couple is embracing each other.]
Nathaniel: I love you, Prudence.
Prudence: And to I you, Nathaniel.
Nathaniel: But I love you more, Prudence.
Prudence: [flicking hand against Nathaniel] Then I love you slightly more than that, Nathaniel.
Nathaniel: It's not a competition, Prudence.
Prudence: But if it were, I'd be winning.
SpongeBob: Aw, this is so sweet. [whispering] But it's not funny.
Patrick: [laughing]
SpongeBob: [pointing at Patrick] But your laughter is [covering mouth with hands] so infectious. [laughing with Patrick]
[The audience gets angry at SpongeBob and Patrick.]
French Narrator: [while SpongeBob's brain is displayed, with a bone in a gear hole] And just then, all the years of excessive laughing [bone moves along the gear hole until it ends up on the far right before it sputters] finally took their toll, and SpongeBob's funny bone got stuck in high gear.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughing, then Patrick stops as SpongeBob slaps his knees and continues laughing]
Patrick: It's not that funny, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [continues laughing, slaps back seats]
Prudence: [she and Nathaniel glare at SpongeBob] Hey, what are you laughing at? [crossing arms] This is a melodrama, not a comedy.
Nathaniel: Yes. Take a hike, Chuckles.
Audience: [booing SpongeBob as he continues laughing]
Patrick: Can you believe this guy, laughing all through the movie like that?
Usher: [shining flashlight] Who is making all that noise? [shines the flashlight onto SpongeBob, who is still laughing. He takes SpongeBob by his nose] All right, laughing boy, take your hardy har hars [takes SpongeBob out] outside!
Audience: [cheering]
SpongeBob: [usher kicks him out into the dumpster] Oh! [emerges from the dumpster, laughing still] Huh? Uh-oh. Why can't--why can't I stop laughing? [laughs, covering mouth] Oh, what am I going to do? [giggles, covering mouth] I'll just have to-- [laughing, covering mouth] hold it in. [snickers while hugging himself, then hops out the dumpster and runs out]
[SpongeBob drunkenly walks downtown while hugging himself.]
SpongeBob: I know. I'll just hold my breath. [inhales deeply, begins floating and grabs a pole, then stops]
Man: [to a small man in a comically large hat] No doubt about it, sir. You look fantastic in that hat.
SpongeBob: [approaching while laughing, eyes fill with tears]
Man with hat: Oh, I look fantastic, huh? [smashes hat onto the man, then runs away]
SpongeBob: Oh, wait. I'm not laughing at you. I really like that hat. [laughing while running towards the man, then stops, then continues laughing the other way]
Milkman: [sobbing in front of a damaged milk truck, near some broken milk jars]
SpongeBob: You're crying over spilled milk! [laughs] Sorry! [runs away] Sorry. Sorry.
[Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob peeks out from the wall, then slides to the front door while covering his mouth.]
SpongeBob: [giggles while flailing to open the door, then runs inside and hides under a table]
[SpongeBob quickly moves from table to table.]
SpongeBob: Okay, if I can just make it to the kitchen, [slithers along the floor] nobody will hear me laughing. [chuckles as Squidward enters from a door]
[SpongeBob lands onto Squidward's face.]
Squidward: SpongeBob, kindly get in the kitchen. [pulls SpongeBob off of his face] And off of my face!
SpongeBob: Your face ? [laughs]
Squidward: What's so funny about my face?
SpongeBob: [giggles] Well, there's nothing funny about your--face. [laughs, then dashes into the kitchen, still laughing]
Squidward: [entering cashier boat] Don't laugh at me. [points to himself then to the kitchen] I laugh at you. [crosses arms] Ha! [slumps, then looks at his reflection in a mirror]
Reflection: Don't listen to him. You're beautiful. [kisses Squidward] Mwah.
[Cut to SpongeBob entering the storage room and closing the door behind him.]
SpongeBob: Nobody will hear my laughs in here. [laughs]
[The camera pans upward to reveal that SpongeBob's laughs can be heard through an air vent on the ceiling. The customers are appalled.]
Old lady: Hey, I'm eating here!
Man: [as everyone begins leaving] Why is the restaurant laughing at us?
Mr. Krabs: [in his office, writing on a piece of paper as he hears SpongeBob's laughing] Huh? [growls]
[SpongeBob is still laughing in the storage room as Mr. Krabs suddenly opens the door.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [laughing while banging on the floor as he is dragged into the kitchen by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Your little laughing prank just scared away [sets SpongeBob down, who is covering his mouth] all me customers. Explain yourself, boyo!
Squidward: [pointing at his face] He's laughing at my face, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: [waving hands] Oh, I'm not laughing at you, Squidward. [laughing while covering his mouth] I'm not laughing at anything. [laughs, putting hands onto Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs, what do I do?
Mr. Krabs: [placing SpongeBob in front of the grill] Think of happy thoughts [slaps patty onto the grill and puts a spatula in SpongeBob's hand] and just knock it off!
Upturn: [opens kitchen door while holding her worm Fifi] I am offended! [petting Fifi] There is no one here to take my Fifi's order!
Mr. Krabs: [approaching Upturn] Oh, gold-plated sorries, Lady Upturn. Mr. Squidward will take your very important order right away.
Fifi: [tries to reach for the patty on the grill, then leaps for it while making Upturn fall]
Upturn: Whoa! I need an ambulance.
SpongeBob: [laughs]
Upturn: How dare you laugh at my misfortune! Mr. Krabs, fire this cretin at once!
Mr. Krabs: You heard her. [points to the entrance] Come back when you're not a giggling idiot.
SpongeBob: [laughing while holding his mouth] Don't come back? But, Mr. Krabs, I'm not laughing on p-p-p, uh, purpose. [laughs while looking at Fifi]
Upturn: [gasps] He's laughing at you, Fifi. [puts her head down]
Fifi: [growls, then wrestles SpongeBob while biting his nose]
SpongeBob: [getting up] I'm sorry, Fifi. [grabbing onto Mr. Krabs] I'm a monster! [runs away laughing, then runs in town while some people look out their windows]
[SpongeBob hides behind a building.]
SpongeBob: I gotta hide. That way, my laughter won't hurt anyone else. [laughs while entering the building into a dark room] Okay, good. It's dark. If there's nothing to see, there's nothing to laugh at. Right? [snickering as the lights turn on to reveal he is in an operating room, with doctors watching]
Surgeon: [a nurse opens the door as he wheels in a robot patient] Today, we will be operating on a robot.
Doctors: Oh, robot.
Doctor: How exciting.
Female doctor: What will they think of next?
Surgeon: I will begin by loosening the first bolt. [holds out hand] Nurse, wrench. [the nurse hands him a wrench and strains while operating, sweating] Wow. This is really on tight. Nurse, sponge.
SpongeBob: [while being used to wipe the surgeon's sweat] Ooh. [laughing]
Surgeon: Laughing is not allowed in the operating room. Get out of here!
[SpongeBob's drool lands onto the robot, making it spark and get up. It grabs a blowtorch and a handheld saw.]
Robot: [laughs, blowtorch activates as it chases the others in a circle while SpongeBob continues laughing] I am the surgeon now. I am the surgeon now. I am the surgeon now.
Doctor: [all the doctors write on their clipboards] Fascinating.
SpongeBob: [exits the Emergency building while laughing, leaving the nurse and doctor behind]
Surgeon: [head slides off, crosses his arms]
SpongeBob: [running away] That is not funny. [laughing, then stops next to a poster that depicts him that says ""WANTED: LAUGHING MANIAC."" He sees a cemetery up ahead] The cemetery. There's nothing funny in a cemetery. [snickering] Maybe I'll just live the rest of my life here. [snickering as he runs into the cemetery, then walks onward and sees clowns crying at a funeral, gasps] Clowns? Oh, no.
Clown: [at a podium] There are two kinds of clowns in this world, clowns that are only laughing on the outside, and clowns that are only laughing on the inside. Sparklenose the Clown was both, and that's what made him a star. [honks a horn, then the others follow]
SpongeBob: [stifling laugher] So solemn. I should leave. [tries to run off, then trips on a rock, bounces off of a clown, and lands on Sparklenose] Whoa! [Sparklenose's nose lands on his, then he laughs] Holy herring, I'm squatting on a corpse.
Sparklenose: Would you get off my chest? [takes his nose and puts it back on]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Huh? [pointing] You're alive? [laughing]
Sparklenose: Of course I'm alive. This is a living funeral, and you're ruining it.
SpongeBob: S-S-S-Sorry. I'm not laughing at you, Sparklenose. [stands up] Oh, I'll just get off of your chest. [falls, tripping over a wreath on a pole] Whoa!
Sparklenose: [the wreath lands on his neck] I'm allergic to wreath pollen! Eeh, ah...
Clown: [pointing] Cheese it, [the other clowns back away] he's gonna blow!
Sparklenose: Achoo! [from a distance, a blue sparkle explosion cloud appears, and the scene comes back with everyone covered in sparkles]
SpongeBob: Sorry. [laughs]
Sparklenose: [pointing while SpongeBob covers his mouth] You turned my clown funeral into a joke! [honking horn, then the others follow]
SpongeBob: [laughing and jumping, runs away] Forgive me, Sparklenose! [laughs]
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob walking in an alleyway.]
French Narrator: Hours later, poor SpongeBob still could not stop laughing. And his laughing mouth got so big, [SpongeBob, whose face is now an entire mouth, starts laughing again] it took over his whole face.
SpongeBob: [stifles laughter] Oh, I'm tired of all this cackling and chuckling. I feel more like I want to-- [stifles laugter while seeing a movie theater in the distance] Oh, ""Weep""? ""The saddest movie ever""? [eyes pop out of his mouth] That's it! [stifles laughter] A movie started my laughing. Maybe a movie can stop it. [laughs while covering his mouth, walking off]
[Cut to the movie, which is in black and white.]
Pufferfish man: [sobbing while holding onto a woman]
Squid woman: [sobbing]
Man: [crying over a dropped ice cream cone]
[The scene zooms out from the screen to reveal SpongeBob and a few other audience members.]
SpongeBob: [stifles laughter, then laughs as he gets shushed by the audience members] I'm sorry. [sticks the popcorn bowl in his mouth, then laughs again] I can't hold it! [takes off the seat cushion and stuffs it in his mouth, which inflates, then he begins laughing again and slapping the seat as people begin to leave]
Grandma SquarePants: [laughing off-screen, making SpongeBob return back to normal]
SpongeBob: Huh? [sees his grandma laughing, then approaches her] Grandma? You can't stop laughing either?
Grandma SquarePants: Of course not, dearie. My funny bone got stuck years ago when I was your age.
SpongeBob: Your funny bone?
Grandma SquarePants: That's right. It happens to everyone in our family. Be proud of that laugh, SpongeBob. To be a SquarePants is to laugh loud at life. [pats a seat] Enjoy a good laugh with me.
SpongeBob: [sits down with his grandma] Oh, thanks, Grandma.

However, neither he nor Patrick can start the box. They take it to the Imagination Box Repair, where the clerk tells them their box has blown its ""whimsy gasket,"" and new ones are not being made. When Patrick throws the box at Squidward's house, Squidward comes out to yell at them and falls inside. SpongeBob and Patrick open it and do not find Squidward inside, realizing he fixed the box with his fall.Squidward is trapped in a dark room. SpongeBob and Patrick tell him he can imagine a flashlight to see better, and he does. Squidward runs up a staircase, which disappears, and he cannot get out. When SpongeBob tells him to imagine someplace he would rather be, he imagines a peaceful beach vacation for himself. When he describes the scenery of ""beautiful tropical plants"" to the two, Patrick asks if he is in a jungle full of dangerous animals, leading Squidward to think about them and need to escape.When the animals attack Squidward and rip his clothes off, SpongeBob and Patrick remind him that he can imagine whatever he wants, so he gives himself a safari outfit. However, Patrick mentions a stampede of sea elephants, which chase after Squidward. He escapes in a hot air balloon thought up by SpongeBob, and a tornado that turns into a bubble tornado brings him back to safety. Patrick asks if there are dinosaurs in the jungle, making one appear and chase Squidward.To get him out of the jungle, SpongeBob advises that Squidward think of his favorite place. Squidward transports himself to a jazz club. SpongeBob and Patrick's air-guitar playing outside causes it to be invaded by rock-loving punks. At SpongeBob's suggestion, Squidward ""clears his mind,"" sending him to the Doodle Dimension. SpongeBob warns him about DoodleBob and puts a picture of him in the box. DoodleBob comes to life and attacks Squidward. Patrick tells him to escape by drawing an exit door with his ink.Squidward exits the door and appears in front of his own house. Although he does not see SpongeBob and Patrick anywhere, he is unconcerned. He goes ""where imagination goes to die"": the Krusty Krab, now enjoying his mundane job after the adventures he has had. In reality, Squidward is still trapped in the box, but SpongeBob and Patrick decide not to tell him and leave him alone.",Squidiot Box,"[The episode begins with an open shot of SpongeBob's pineapple.]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] I have put off cleaning my attic for way too long. [rises from pile in attic, gasps, then picks up a shell with a diaper] Aww! Gary's baby shell! [puts shell to face] They grow up so fast.
[Urchins land all over SpongeBob, and after a bit he notices them.]
SpongeBob: Hey! [slips backwards into the junk pile, making it explode]
[A cardboard box appears, and SpongeBob lifts it up.]
SpongeBob: Hey! My imagination box! [carrying box] I wonder if it still works. [goes outside with box, then places it down] [jumps] Oh, boy! It's time for... [waves hands to form a rainbow like in ""Idiot Box""] imagination. [giggles, then flies inside the box, leaving behind a rainbow] Whee-hee!
[The box closes, and an engine is heard grinding.]
SpongeBob: [pops out of the box] That's weird.
Patrick: [walking with a pitcher while eating sand] Hey, neighbor. Can I borrow a cup of sand? I'm all out. Huh? [drops pitcher, points to box] Hey! Isn't that the...?
SpongeBob: It is! But it won't start.
Patrick: Oh. Let me see if I [enters box] can get it going.
[They both close the box shut. More engine noises are heard, then a wheezing sound. SpongeBob and Patrick pop out of the box.]
SpongeBob: We need a professional. [both start walking inside the box]
[Bubble transition to a cardboard building that says ""IMAGINATION BOX REPAIR."" SpongeBob and Patrick are walking to it with the box on.]
SpongeBob: [rainbow forms on front of building] Imagination Box Repair. This is the place.
[Cut to the inside of the repair store. An repairman places a box on a counter.]
Box repairman: [notices SpongeBob and Patrick] Ooh!
[The box repairman dives into the box and comes out in another place with several boxes.]
Box repairman: Aha! [gets inside another box and comes out another] Ooh. [spins out of SpongeBob and Patrick's box] Welcome! [confetti comes out of his body] [clapping, getting out of the box] Wow, a double corrugated 3600. I haven't seen one of these in 25 years. What seems to be the problem?
SpongeBob: Well, the inspiration motor won't turn over. [spits] Dern thing's on the fritz.
Patrick: [pointing to box] Yeah. And it doesn't work.
Box repairman: [picks up box] Hmm. Let me take a look under the flap. [steps away]
[SpongeBob and Patrick follow the repairman by flying, leaving behind trails of rainbows.]
Box repairman: [operating under the box, and rainbows spout onto his eye, then gets next to SpongeBob and Patrick] Well, there's your problem. Your box has blown a whimsy gasket. They don't make those anymore! But I could give you a [points ahead] great deal on a [camera pans over to a beat up fort of cushions] cushion fort.
SpongeBob: No, that's okay. [points to himself] I'm a cardboard man.
[Bubble transition to Conch Street, where SpongeBob and Patrick are walking with the box on top of them. They arrive at SpongeBob's house.]
Patrick: [lifting box] Aw, this dumb ol' box is just junk [throws box at Squidward's front doorstep] now.
Squidward: [opens door] Hey! [walks over to yell] Get off my sand! [falls into box] Whoa! [thumping and yelling] What's happening? Where am I?
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick approach the box] Inside my imagination box.
Patrick: [open the box with SpongeBob, which is empty] Where'd he go?
SpongeBob: You must have jostled something and fixed it. [gasps] Patrick! Squidward must be lost!
Patrick: [a foghorn blares] Lost in his own...
SpongeBob and Patrick: [waving their hands to form a rainbow] Imagination! [close box]
[Squidward is stuck in a dark room, with only his eyes showing.]
Squidward: [groans] I can't see a thing in here! I need a flashlight!
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Just imagine a flashlight.
Squidward: [mockingly] Oh, yeah, right. I'll just imagine it and it'll appear! [grumbles, then he is holding a flashlight] What the--oh, it worked. [aiming flashlight] Now where's the way out of here? [finds a staircase] Ooh! I'm leaving! [running up the spiral staircase which abruptly ends] Huh? [staircase disappears, making him fall and scream] [lands back on the ground] How do I get out of this crazy place?
SpongeBob: [from outside box] That's easy, Squidward. Just visualize where you'd rather be!
Squidward: [in box] I'd rather be far away from you! Like at a fancy beach resort. [the setting suddenly changes to a beach resort, gasps] And relaxing on a lounge chair. [a lounge chair appears] Ooh! [sits in lounge chair wearing beach attire] Ahh, sipping a tropical drink. [a woman gives him a coconut drink, which he drinks] Ahh. [lifts up sunglasses] Maybe this imagination thing isn't so bad after all.
[Patrick is drawing him and SpongeBob in the sand with a stick.]
SpongeBob: What are you doing now?
Squidward: [in box] Well, if you must know, I'm relaxing under an umbrella surrounded by beautiful tropical plants.
Patrick: Sounds like you're in a jungle.
Squidward: No! It's not a-- [setting changes to a jungle] jungle? [his drink turns into a spider, whimpers as it crawls away]
SpongeBob: Are jungles full of dangerous animals?
Patrick: Yep! [yelling] Like scary sea snakes!
Squidward: Huh?
[The beach chair turns into a sea snake that wraps around Squidward.]
Squidward: [screams, as well as his eyeballs]
[Squidward gets out of the sea snake and runs away. The sea snake tries to bite him, and chases after him. Squidward grabs onto the lady from earlier.]
Squidward: Hey! You gotta help me!
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Oh, and look out for sea panthers.
[The lady turns into a sea panther, which roars at Squidward, making him scream.]
Squidward: [running away, bumps into a branch, then hides in a log]
[The panther lands on the log and jumps past it. The sea snake slithers past it. Meanwhile, Patrick is playing with a cup and ball as SpongeBob looks at the box.]
SpongeBob: How's it going in there, Squidward?
Squidward: [in box] You're making everything worse! Would you two clam up?
Patrick: Oh, I forgot to mention the clothes-eating clams.
Squidward: [in box, chomping is heard, screams] Giant clams! Ahhh! Let go! Ow! Ouch! Hey, that's my shirt! Oh, fantastic! Now I'm lost in the jungle with no clothes on.
SpongeBob: That's no problem. Remember, you can [uses hands to form a rainbow arch] imagine anything! [Patrick does the same]
Squidward: [naked, covering himself in the jungle] Imagine, huh? All right. [straining, safari clothes appear on him] Oh, not bad. [stretches pants waist] A jungle [pulls out and twirls binoculars] safari could be fun.
Patrick: Oh! And whatever you do, don't imagine... a stampede of sea elephants!
[Elephant noises are heard.]
Squidward: [in box] Thanks a lot!
Patrick: No problem!
Squidward: [in box] Now tell me how to escape from a stampede of sea elephants!
SpongeBob: Hmm. If only you had a hot air balloon.
[Squidward is seen in the jungle running away. He skids to a halt as he sees a SpongeBob hot air balloon.]
Hot air balloon: [laughs]
Squidward: [hesitates, then pulls on the balloon's string, then unties it]
[A close-up of Squidward's foot being tangled in the rope is shown. The hot air balloon starts to float, and Squidward is taken upward just as the sea elephants stampede by.]
Hot air balloon: [laughing]
Squidward: [screams]
[Elephant noises and Squidward noises are heard from the box as it bounces in place.]
SpongeBob: [pointing to box] I've always wanted to ride in a balloon.
Patrick: [points to himself] Me too! Unless there's a tornado.
Squidward: [in box] Tornado? [wind is heard blowing as the box spins around in place]
[The tornado is seen, spinning several objects around. The SpongeBob hot air balloon takes Squidward around with it.]
Hot air balloon: [laughing]
Squidward: [screaming]
Hot air balloon: Whee!
[The rope detaches from Squidward's foot, and he falls down screaming.]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] You know what's better than a tornado? A bubble tornado.
Squidward: [bubbles start to form around him] Huh? [gets inside a bubble as they spin around him] Huh? [lounges] Ahh. [lands softly on the ground inside the bubble]
[The hot air balloon then crushes Squidward as it lands.]
SpongeBob: You okay, Squidward?
Squidward: [yelling from inside box] No!
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick sit down] He's okay.
Patrick: Say, [pointing to box] are there dinosaurs in the jungle?
Squidward: [in box, dinosaur sounds are heard] Oh, no. [dinosaur roaring is heard as he is then seen running away from one] I hate imagination!
Dinosaur: [tries to chomp on Squidward, who jumps, then tries and fails to chomp him again]
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick drinking from soda cans while on lounge chairs. Squidward is heard panting as the box jumps up repeatedly.]
SpongeBob: I'm so happy Squidward's having such an exciting adventure.
Squidward: [in box] How do I get out of this jungle?
SpongeBob: [tosses soda can] Hmm. Try [uses hands to form a rainbow arch] imagining your favorite place!
Squidward: [in box] Favorite place? Um, I've got it! A jazz club.
[Kelpy G and two other performers are performing onstage at the jazz club. Squidward looks around in the jazz club.]
Squidward: Ooh, [wearing jazz club clothing] finally. A place with [sits down at a table] culture.
[A waitress gives Squidward a fancy cup. She pours coffee in it, and a music note made of coffee pops out of it. She walks away.]
Squidward: [picks up cup, sniffs] Ahh. Even the coffee smells like jazz. [snapping fingers] Oh, yeah. Digging that groove.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [look at each other] We dig it! [play air guitar]
Squidward: [grumbling, then takes a sip and spits out rocks] Ugh! This coffee tastes like rocks! [rock music is heard playing, which makes him drop the cup]
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Gary are performing onstage in rock band attire. Bubble Bass jumps off the stage and lands on Squidward's table, crushing it. Everyone around Squidward is now also dressed in punk attire.]
Squidward: [hands on ears, screaming, box jumps up and visibly heats up] Everything's gone crazy!
SpongeBob: Sounds like your imagination is overheating. Try to clear your mind.
Squidward: [in box, box cools down] Clear my mind? Clear my mind! Phew!
SpongeBob: Where are you now, Squidward?
Squidward: [in box] I'm in an empty white void. But at least it's peaceful.
SpongeBob: Uh, that sounds like the Doodle dimension.
Patrick: Watch out for DoodleBob!
Squidward: [in box] What's he look like?
SpongeBob: Um, [draws on notebook] he looks kind of like [slides picture of DoodleBob into void, which Squidward picks up] this.
DoodleBob: [yelling and gibbering as he exits the paper]
Squidward: [screams, tries to run away before DoodleBob grabs him by the tentacles and smacks him back and forth like in ""Frankendoodle""] [in box] Would somebody please-- [box falls and lifts back up] Tell me how-- [box falls and lifts back up] To get out of this-- [box falls and lifts back up] Stupid box?! [box falls back down]
SpongeBob: You want out?
Patrick: Well, why didn't you say so? Just draw an exit door.
Squidward: [in box floating in air] I don't have a pen! [box falls]
SpongeBob: [points] You're an octopus. You're full of ink.
[DoodleBob is still hitting Squidward back and forth. Squidward shoots ink from his nose onto DoodleBob, stunning him. Squidward slips on some of his ink, then squirts ink onto the wall to form a door. He exits through the door just in time for DoodleBob to miss him. He lands out of the box on the ground.]
Squidward: [panting] Huh? Huh? [sees his house] I'm home! [laughs lying flat on the doorstep] Hmph. Where did SpongeBob and Patrick run off to? [gets up] Oh, well. I'm going to the place where imagination goes to [hits fist on tentacle] die.
[Cut to Squidward walking to the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: My dreary, pointless minimum wage [opens front door] job. [in register as a customer approaches, inhales] Ah, [picks up notepad and pencil] the good old boring Krusty Krab. I'm actually happy to be back.
[The scene fades out to reveal he is still in the imagination box.]
Squidward: [in box] May I take your order, sir?
Patrick: Should we tell him?
SpongeBob: Nah, he sounds so happy.
Squidward: [in box] One Krabby combo coming up!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [shrug and walk away]

Mr. Krabs: Goobfather? Aren't you the manager of the Goofy Goober?
Goobfather: That's just my day job. The Goobfather is my true identity. I control all the ice cream trade in this town, and I heard about your little [pulls down menu] fatty flips.
Mr. Krabs: [points to menu] That's Patty Whips. And a little friendly competition never hurt anyone.
Goobfather: [chuckles and pushes menu back up] Of course not, but maybe you should stick to flipping patties and leave the frozen treats to the experts, [tips over SpongeBob's Patty Whip] hmm?

Mr. Krabs: In your ice dreams, Goobfather!

Squidward: Oh, fudge! [falls off]
[Mr. Krabs climbs out of the rubble.]
Mr. Krabs: Ugh, not giving up!
Goobfather: [climbs out] Me neither!
[Mr. Krabs rips off his shirt and takes out popsicles to use as nunchucks, twirls them, jumps over them, and whips them. The Goobfather takes out an ice cream cone and presses it to extend some scoops out. They both fight. The Goobfather's ice cream hits Mr. Krabs' chest. Mr. Krabs samples some of the ice cream left over. He hits the Goobfather with his nunchucks. Suddenly, machinery is heard whirring.]
Mr. Krabs: What's that sound?
Goobfather: It couldn't be!
[The Ice Cream King is riding a blimp.]
Goobfather and Mr. Krabs: The Ice Cream King!?
Ice Cream King: [speaking through megaphone] Cease your hostil-lily-- hostile-- quit fightin'! Ice cream isn't meant for brawling! It's supposed to bring sugar fueled fun, belly aches, and brain freezes to the world!
Mr. Krabs: He's right.
Goobfather: We shouldn't be fighting.
Mr. Krabs: There's plenty of saps-- er, customers in town for both of us.
[Mr. Krabs and the Goobfather eat their weapons and hug.]
Ice Cream King: And if you don't quit fighting, I'll use my ultimate weapon, the ice cream bomb!
Goobfather and Mr. Krabs: Ice cream bomb!?
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Wait!
Goobfather: We've already stopped fighting!
Ice Cream King: What? I-I can't hear you! Uh, hold on, I'll be right down. Bombs away! [hits button and rides down on a giant popsicle, waving his crown] Whoo-hoo! Yee-haw! Yee-ha-haw!
[The ice cream bomb lands on Mr. Krabs and the Goobfather and explodes, covering Bikini Bottom in ice cream. Squidward screams as he is sent through the air. A guy eats the ice cream.]
Guy: Hey, everyone, free ice cream!
[Kids dive into the ice cream and eat it. SpongeBob and Patrick eat it.]
Patrick: Is this a dream?
Bubble Bass: [with a wheelbarrow full of ice cream] Free ice cream forever! [giggles]

When he picks it up with tongs, it crumbles into pieces. Krabs tells him to keep cooking with one of the dirty, greasy replacement spatulas in the kitchen, but SpongeBob wants to use his own spatula instead. Threatened with SpongeTom taking over his job if he does not find another way to cook, SpongeBob heads off to the Mystical Misty Mountains to find Guru Greasetrap and repair his spatula.SpongeBob starts climbing the mountain, and loses his backpack when he sets it down and it causes the rock to collapse. He meets Rube, who is giving tours. Rube helps SpongeBob cross a rickety bridge, but then leaves when his shift is over. SpongeBob continues climbing to meet the guru on the mountaintop. Greasetrap knows why he is here, and goes to get his hammer and anvil to reforge the spatula. When SpongeBob tries to help him, he accidentally drops anvils on Greasetrap's hands, severely injuring them. After being told that the true spatula is ""inside him,"" which he does not understand, SpongeBob is left to learn how to reforge it himself.Greasetrap gives SpongeBob a few training exercises, which he cannot get right. However, his determination leads Greasetrap to let him try it. SpongeBob melts his spatula's parts into metal, pours it into a template, hammers it flat, and cools it down with snow, restoring it completely. So he will not be late, Greasetrap kicks him down the mountain, making him roll into a snowball and crash into the Krusty Krab.SpongeBob crashes on top of SpongeTom, who was almost taking his job. However, when he tries flipping a patty, his spatula immediately breaks. He remembers Greasetrap's words that the spatula is inside him, and uses his hands to prepare the patties instead. In the process, he injures them and has them wrapped in casts, like Greasetrap. When Greasetrap visits, he realizes that SpongeBob had misunderstood his advice: lifting up his body reveals the spatula literally contained inside of him. Before SpongeBob goes back to work, Mr. Krabs suggests that he wash his new spatula first.",Spatula of the Heavens,"[The episode opens with lots of customers at the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: [writes an order ticket then throws it at the window] SpongeBob, hurry up in there! [writes another order ticket and throws it at the window]
SpongeBob: [runs while reading an order ticket and spins his spatula] 4,297 Krabby Patties, [unveils a stack of patties from his hat] coming right up! [brings the spatula to the first patty on top then flicks all of them down on the grill]
[SpongeBob flips away stacks of lettuce, tomatoes and onions, then one slice of each stack land on a bun. SpongeBob then flips the Krabby Patties onto the buns and takes off, accidentally leaving his spatula on the grill. After the patties land on the slices of ingredients, SpongeBob lays the top bun on each sandwich and smiles at them.]
SpongeBob: [carrying two plates full of Krabby Patties] Order's up! [notices his spatula on the grill and screams as he drops the plates and rushes to the grill] Spatty! [pulls out a tong] Hang in there buddy, [uses the tongs to carefully remove the spatula from the grill] I'll save you! [the spatula cools off and he sighs in relief]
[The spatula shatters into pieces, and SpongeBob gasps.]
SpongeBob: No!
[The scene cuts to an overwhelmed Squidward trying to take orders until he gets frustrated and yells at SpongeBob through the order window.]
Squidward: SpongeBob, where are my orders?!
SpongeBob: I... I can't flip patties anymore.
Mr. Krabs: [heard off-screen squealing, then shoves Squidward out of the way and peeks through the order window] You what? [squeezes through the kitchen window] You better explain yourself, boy-o!
SpongeBob: My spatula's broken Mr. Krabs, I can't make Krabby Patties without Spatty!
Mr. Krabs: Is that all? Just grab another one from the spatular closet. [opens a cabin to reveal many greasy and worn out spatulas]
SpongeBob: Oh, I can't cook with those, Mr. Krabs. I need to use my own spatula, not just any spatula. You see Mr. Krabs, Spatty is very special and very ancient. He was forged deep in the mountains beyond the horizon, in the far flung land of-

SpongeTom: I'm prepared!
SpongeBob: No! Anything but that! Don't worry, I'll get my spatula reforged! [runs out of the kitchen and runs through customers]
Squidward: SpongeBob, where are you-
SpongeBob: [dodges and runs through the customers] Hold down the fort for me Squidward, thanks!
[SpongeBob runs out of the Krusty Krab to his house and breaks through his door and the back to get a hiking backpack. He runs through Jellyfish Fields, Kelp Forest, and walks tiredly through a desert out of breath. He approaches an ice cream stand with Incidental 39 offering him two strawberry ice cream cones.]
SpongeBob: [accepts the ice creams] Thank you. [puts each cone on his shoes and starts skiing]
Incidental 39: Hm, I've been using them wrong all these years!
[SpongeBob continues skiing upwards to a hill eventually bringing him up to Bikini Atoll and goes to the other side of the island, stumbling his way to the Mystical Misty Mountains.]
SpongeBob: The Mystical Misty Mountains. Finally here!
[The camera pans up revealing a long climb to the top.]
SpongeBob: And now for a short walk to the top.
[SpongeBob throws up rope to hold onto a rock, using to climb himself up.]

Rube: [offscreen] Amazing! [walks to SpongeBob] Right on time!
SpongeBob: I am?
Rube: You sure [pokes SpongeBob] are! I'll be your guide today! First off, we'll cross this amazing fish made bridge!
[SpongeBob notices that the bridge is very rickety and made of boards roped on top of each other, then gulps in fear.]
Rube: Don't worry! This is way easier than it looks! [he and SpongeBob start crossing the bridge] On your left, is the chasm of [a shallow of spikes are shown] infinite bruising!
SpongeBob: [the bridge starts shaking] D'oh! Wonderful!
Rube: And on your right, [a pit of frozen fishes are shown] we got the freezing pit!
[Three of the fishes blink and SpongeBob shivers in fear.]
Rube: [runs to the end of the bridge and jumps over the last piece of it] I told ya it'd be a breeze!
[SpongeBob is seen clutching onto the bridge and crawls his way to Rube.]
Rube: You're doing amazing! Let's keep moving! [approaches a keep out sign] Oh! Well, here we are. Huh, [shrugs at SpongeBob] this is where we part company! Beyond this point lies [the camera pans closer to his face] only death... [the camera pans out] Plus I clock out at six! Have fun! [walks to an elevator]

SpongeBob: Woah! [walks up to Guru] Woah! [notices a ring bell] Oh! [rings the bell]
Guru Greasetrap: [wakes up and slaps himself three times] Ah. All better now.
SpongeBob: Oh, uh sorry to disturb your sacred snoring ritual, but I have traveled a long way, from the kitchen of the Krusty Krab just to get-
Guru Greasetrap: Say no more! Guru Greasetrap already knows why SpongeBob is here.
SpongeBob: [sighs excitedly]
Guru Greasetrap: [lifts up his coat revealing a mini utensil shop under him] We have just what you need! Melon ballers, spaghetti spools, bake timers, and there's also a special on this giant banana hanger! [holding a bake timer] Whaddya say?
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Uh, this is all really nice, but, [reaches into his pockets] I just need to get my beloved [holds out the broken spatula pieces] spatula fixed. Can you reforge it? [kneels on his knees] Oh please tell me we can save him, Mr. Greasetrap!
Guru Greasetrap: Oh, is that all? Sure! It'll just take a few minutes. Just let the old man grab his hammer and anvil. [walks up to a closet]
SpongeBob: [runs to the closet] Ooh! Let me get it for ya! [opens the door and the anvils start shaking]
Guru Greasetrap: No, wait! [tries to prevent the anvils from falling but they land on his hands and he shrieks]
SpongeBob: Don't worry! [attempts to remove an anvil]
[Guru sighs in disappointment.]
French Narrator: [reading time card] Later..
Guru Greasetrap: Greasetrap cannot reforge your spatula until my hands have healed up. But your true spatula is inside you! [raises his eyebrows twice]
[SpongeBob looks around confused, gasps excitedly then sighs sadly and looks at Guru Greasetrap.]
Guru Greasetrap: [sighs] Fine, I can teach you to reforge it.
SpongeBob: [gasps excitedly and hugs Guru] Oh thank you mister, Oh thank you!

Guru Greasetrap: Do not carry the wood; let the wood carry you.

Guru Greasetrap: [holding a stick] Become one with the fire.
SpongeBob: Neh-heh! [twists a stick onto a log and pants as he twists it faster, making a fire] Whoo! Huh? [the fire catches up on Guru's coat]
Guru Greasetrap: Ahh! I'm one with the fire! [runs away screaming and lands face first on a pile of snow]
SpongeBob: Um, master? Is it time yet?
French Narrator: [reading time card] Many, many unbearable moments later...
Guru Greasetrap: Ohh.. he'll never be ready.
SpongeBob: [walking in a circle determined] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm read- [Guru stops him with his hand]
Guru Greasetrap: You know what?
SpongeBob: What?
Guru Greasetrap: [grabs SpongeBob] You've convinced me! [brings him to a fireplace] Greasetrap also thinks you're ready!
SpongeBob: Really?
Guru Greasetrap: Mmm-hmm!
[SpongeBob gasps excitedly, bringing out the broken spatula pieces.]
SpongeBob: Hear that, Spatty? It is finally time. [walks up to the fireplace and drops all of the pieces into a coaster]
[The spatula melts and SpongeBob uses a grabber to move the coaster. He pours the melted spatula into a spatula-shaped rock mold. The scene cuts to SpongeBob metalsmithing the hot spatula using a hammer and anvil, then places it into a pile of snow, melting the snow which reveals a cooled-off spatula.]
SpongeBob: [examines spatula using a magnifying glass, connects the spatula to the handle, squeals excitedly and kisses the spatula] You're finally back! [hugs the spatula]
Guru Greasetrap: Finally, indeed. [SpongeBob puts the spatula in his pocket]
SpongeBob: Thank you from the bottom of my pants, master! [hears his watch beeping] Oh no! I have to find a way back to the Krusty Krab, before it's [his watch is shown in four different sections: Late, Too Late, Early, and Right on Time; the watch hand is almost at Too Late] too late!

SpongeBob: Ooh, I love surprises! [covers his eyes with his hands]
Guru Greasetrap: [kicks SpongeBob] Surprise! [SpongeBob screams and falls down the mountain as Guru Greasetrap walks to his chair watching television as game show dings and buzzers are heard from ""The Price Is Right""]
[As SpongeBob continues falling down the mountain, he gets caught in turning into a snowball, which increases.]
Rube: [heading to his car and locks it until he notices he's in a shadow; turns around to see the giant snowball] Amazing! [the snowball lands and bounces away on him, turning him into a snowman]
Incidental 39: [tries to put on two ice cream cones as ice skates and notices the snowball passing by] Huh? [sees the snowball pass by]
[The snowball goes through the dessert, Kelp Forest, Jellyfish Fields, and enters Bikini Bottom.]
Mr. Krabs: [looking at the same watch SpongeBob has as the hand ticks at the top] Hmmmm, time's up! The job's yours, SpongeTom.
SpongeTom: [throws away a newspaper he was reading] Oh, boy! [rubs his hands together] My dreams are finally coming true! [as he heads to the grill, SpongeBob crashes atop of his head]

Guru Greasetrap: Remember, your true spatula is inside you. [the steam fades away]
SpongeBob: [forms his hands into two spatulas] Become one with the patties. [carries the patties with his spatula hands, to which he burns, causing him to flip the patties] Every cut is sacred.

SpongeBob: I remembered what you told me, and I went deep within to find my true spatula.

Jack ""Spriggins"" Plankton is seen holding a single coin in sadness, with his chum farm all dried up. He comes across a slot machine giving him the chance to earn a magic bean, to which he seizes. Jack hits the jackpot and obtains a bean, showing it off to Clockwork Karen at home. She's disappointed in him, but decides to feed him the bean so he doesn't famish. This ends up going in an unexpected direction when it ends up growing a beanstalk from his mouth into the sky.Jack ends up at Ye Old Krusty Krab, wondering if someone there can make him rich. Instead, he hears laughter and confuses for it for choking, running under the door and trying to save them. This turns out to be SpongeGoose, which Jack's frightened by and attempts to hide from, jumping into a hole on the floor with - but SpongeGoose pecks him up and eats him. Suddenly, the duo hear stomping noises, and Jack hides in the goose's holes. It turns out to be Giant Krabs, who believes to smell the blood of a ""bottomite,"" but instead smells SpongeGoose's flatulence. He sets the goose on a nest and Krabs brings out SquidHarp to play music so SpongeGoose will dance - which causes it to lay out edible, gold Krabby Patty. Jack's thrown out of Sponge's holes and stepped on, but soon encounters another golden patty. He attempts to escape with it, but Krabs realizes and quickly catches him. The giant feeds Jack to SpongeGoose, but he quickly escapes through the power of Sponge's holes. Jack rides away with the goose and rides back down on the beanstalk, but they slip off of it, so Jack ""abandons goose,"" which proves to be a mistake, falling flat on land while SpongeGoose softly drops onto the floor. Unfortunately, Giant Krabs is still climbing down the beanstalk for revenge, but Jack breaks the storybook mold and shoots out a laser, cutting the beanstalk, causing Krabs to fall and crushing his house.Later, Jack is shown to be just fine, using Krabs' shell and SpongeGoose's golden patty-laying powers to create a successful business for himself, with SpongeGoose joyfully frolicking and serving customers. Jack's next order, however, is revealed to be a shell-less Krabs and Jack closes the episode exclaiming ""no shirt, no shoes, no shell, no service,"" leaving Krabs disappointed.",Plankton and the Beanstalk,"[The episode starts in a peaceful medieval village. A plankton walks out of a Chum Bucket-shaped cottage, holding a single coin.]
Plankton: Once upon a time, there lived a naive little plankton named Jack. Jack's chum farm had dried up, and he only had one single farthing left to buy food at the market.
Jack: [pulls out a photo of a grandfather clock] Fear not, Karen, my clockwork wife. I will spend our last farthing wisely and save us from starvation!
[Jack kisses the photo of his wife and, not paying attention, bumps into a metal wall.]
Jack: Wah, wah, whee! [sees he just bumped into a vending machine] ""Get Rich Now""? ""Magic Bean""? Only one farthing? Hmmm. [His sole pupil turns into a dollar sign] Ka-ching! [laughs maniacally and pushes his coin into the slot]
[The vending machine flashes lights and a bean Jack's height pops out.]
Jack: Uh-oh.
[Jack gets crushed by the bean and is knocked all the way to his cottage.]
Jack: [opens the cottage door] Oh, Karen! I hit the jackpot!
Clockwork Karen: Thank King Neptune. Did you get plenty of food and varnish?
Jack: [jumps onto a barrel next to Clockwork Karen] Better than that, I got a magical bean!
Clockwork Karen: [turns clock hands in confusion] What?! What do you do, boil it?
Jack: You don't eat it, it's magic!
Clockwork Karen: Oh, Jack, I can't believe you blew our last penny on a stupid bean! [facepalms] Well, I still need varnish, but I'm not gonna let you go hungry. Open wide.
Jack: I told you, you don't eat it! It's--
[Clockwork Karen shoves the bean into Jack's mouth and his stomach expands greatly.]
Jack: Well, I'm full. [starts barfing out a beanstalk that propels him out of the cottage and into the sky] I told you so, Karen!
Clockwork Karen: There he goes, anything to win an argument!
[The beanstalk continues to grow from Jack's mouth until it stops at the height of the clouds. Jack spits out the stalk.]
Jack: I don't care if they are good for my heart! I'm never eating another bean. [looks behind and sees a castle] Huh? Ye Old Krusty Krab? [hops over to the door] Maybe someone there can make me rich.
[Jack almost walks inside when a noise comes from behind the door.]
Jack: [gasp] Sounds like someone is choking to death! [runs into the castle] Don't worry, I'll save you!
[Jack runs all the way to the nearby hallway and turns around. A goose-like SpongeBob is laughing and looking at himself in the mirror. He turns to his right and he and Jack make eye contact. The goose then starts skipping over to Jack.]
Jack: Whoa! Galloping goose flesh!
[Jack tries his best to run away. He finds a hole in the ground and hops right into it. the goose pops his head in and throws Jack into the air.]
Jack: I meant well, Karen!

[The goose laughs it off. A quake startles both of them.]
Jack: What the? [looks to his left] Huh?

Giant Krabs: [pulls out SquidHarp] Magic harp, do your thing! [starts strumming SquidHarp's tentacle strings]
SquidHarp: ♪ Ow ow ow ow ow, ow ow ow ow ow ow... ♪
Jack: [shakes in disgust] Horrible.
[SpongeGoose hears the music, gets up, and starts dancing along. Jack falls off SpongeGoose's body and gets crushed several times by SpongeGoose's feet. Suddenly, SpongeGoose stops dancing and starts crouching.]
SpongeGoose: It's ready! It's ready! It's ready!
[Jack tries to get up, but he is immediately crushed by a golden Krabby Patty that SpongeGoose lays. Giant Krabs picks it up.]
Giant Krabs: [dancing] Edible gold, edible gold, edible gold! [takes a bite of the patty]
[Jack gets up again, and avoids the next golden Krabby Patty. He takes a look at it's reflective exterior.]
Jack: I'm rich! [hugs the golden Krabby Patty] Thank you, magic bean!
Giant Krabs: [looks inside the nest] Oh, don't mind if I do.
[Giant Krabs starts to reach for the new patty, but it moves away from the nest.]
Giant Krabs: [grabs the patty] Who disturbs me inner sanctum?
[Giant Krabs sees Jack on the bottom of the golden Krabby Patty and growls.]
Jack: [nervously laughs] Crazy weather, huh? Yipe!
[Jack tries to run away, but Giant Krabs uses his claw to block and catch him.]
Giant Krabs: Gotcha! [dangles Jack with his claw] Whether you're caged or whether you're loose, I'll feed ya to me golden goose!
[SpongeGoose opens his mouth and sticks out his tongue. Giant Krabs holds Jack over his mouth.]
Jack: No! Not the goose!
[Giant Krabs drops Jack and SpongeGoose gulps him up. Jack falls down SpongeGoose's throat.]
Giant Krabs: [laughs] I'll have a solid gold pipsqueak… [pulls out his sundial watch] …in about 4 hours.
Jack: [pops out of SpongeGoose's bottom] Peek-a-boo!
Giant Krabs: What!?
Jack: [jumps onto SpongeGoose's neck and grabs his cloak] Giddy up, galloping gooseflesh! Hya!
[Jack whips the cloak and SpongeGoose runs away from his nest. Giant Krabs tries to stop them, but SpongeGoose jumps in between his eyes. SpongeGoose squeezes under the entrance door and runs away from the castle while dropping golden Krabby Patties. Giant Krabs crashes through his door and chases SpongeGoose and Jack to the beanstalk. SpongeGoose rides it down as Giant Krabs can only look down. As SpongeGoose and Jack ride down the beanstalk, they slip off and start falling to the ground.]
Jack: [whimpers] Abandon goose!
[Jack grabs a golden Krabby Patty and jumps off SpongeGoose. Just before he hits the ground, SpongeGoose flaps his wings and breaks his fall. Jack falls straight into the ground and is crushed by his golden patty.]
Jack: [gets up with SpongeGeese circling his head] I forgot geese can fly.
[Jack is caught off-guard as he sees Giant Krabs climbing down the beanstalk.]
Jack: Alright, enough of this storybook stuff. [pulls out a laser] It's laser time, baby!
[Jack activates his laser and it cuts down the base of the beanstalk.]
Jack: Timber! [maniacally laughs]
[The beanstalk tips over and Giant Krabs drops his weapon to hang on.]
Giant Krabs: Ok, you can keep the goose! [falls off the beanstalk and lands on Jack's cottage, destroying it]
Jack: Oh no. Karen!
Clockwork Karen: [rolls behind him] Jack! Look what you did to our house!
Jack: I just slayed a giant for ya, you wanna lay off?!
[A storybook with the word ""Later"" is shown.]
French Narrator: Later…
[The storybook flips over to the next page, which is actually the next scene, where Clockwork Karen and Jack are selling golden Krabby Patties inside Giant Krabs' shell to everyone in the village. SpongeGoose is next to them dancing for the audience.]
Clockwork Karen: [hands a golden Krabby Patty to a customer] There you go.
Jack: Bon appétit, sir!
Clockwork Karen: You were right, darling. That bean was magic! [kisses Jack]
Jack: [squeezes his cheeks in glee and faces his next customer] And what can I get for you on this magical day, my good sir?
[Jack's belt falls down as he realizes who he's talking to: Giant Krabs without his shell.]
Giant Krabs: [embarrassed] Um, I'd like a double gold patty combo, please?

SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy. [takes off hat] Nice of ya to drop in.
Sandy: [takes out invention] Check it out. I science'd up a new invention. I call it the Anthropomorphizer.
SpongeBob: Ohh.
Sandy: Allow me to demonstrate. [uses the Anthropomorphizer on a table's salt and pepper shakers]

SpongeBob: Oh, I'm sorry everyone keeps trying to eat you, Krabby Patty. You must be having the worst day of your life.
Krabby Patty: [sighs] I've gotta say, it hasn't been what I thought. No matter how many times I jump into someone's mouth, they still won't swallow me.
SpongeBob: Wait, you were jumping into their mouths on purpose?
Krabby Patty: Of course. Doesn't everyone want to be eaten?
SpongeBob: No way. At least I don't think so.

SpongeBob: [screaming, diving and taking Krabby Patty away from the babies]

Daycare worker: [gasps] My babies!
[Cut to the exterior of the building, where the daycare worker kicks SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Whoa!
Krabby Patty: Oh! [gets kicked out, rolling along the road]

Plankton: [screams as Krabby Patty jumps into his mouth]
Krabby Patty: I've gotta fit in here! Come on!

Krabby Patty: Of course I do, SpongeBob. But jellyfishing and ice cream, well, they're for people like [points to SpongeBob] you. I'm different. It's like how [thought cloud appears of SpongeBob handing out a patty] your purpose is making people happy by feeding them, [thought cloud appears of the patty being given to Fred] my purpose is making people happy by feeding them me.
SpongeBob: You know what, Krabby Patty? I get it now. And I'm going to help you [Krabby Patty shakes his finger] be the best meal you can be. Let's find the perfect mouth to gobble you up.
Krabby Patty: Oh, I'm one happy patty! [SpongeBob carries him inside]

SpongeBob: [on megaphone] Auditions are now open to eat my friend Patty.
[The long line pans to the interior of the Krusty Krab, where Krabby Patty is sitting on a red table.]
SpongeBob: Next, please.
[A kid tries to approach Krabby Patty, but Bubble Bass cuts the line and uses his butt to kick the kid out of the way. Glass is heard breaking.]
Bubble Bass: Only I know how to truly savor a Krabby Patty. Therefore, I believe I should have the distinction of eating you.
Krabby Patty: Hmm. [opens Bubble Bass' mouth and is hit with his bad breath, wilting] Ooh! Ahh! Ohh! Ugh! Ew! [pointing] I think you savored that last one a little too long.
SpongeBob: Next!
Bubble Bass: [walking away] Hmph! Well, I never...
Slappy: [walking to Krabby Patty on all fours] Heh-heh-heh-heh, heh. [squishing Krabby Patty] Ohh, what a delicious-looking little man. I could chew on you for hours. [pokes Krabby Patty, cackling]

SpongeBob: [tired] Next. [Nosferatu flies away]
Sandy: [entering, sees Nosferatu leaving] Hmm? Howdy--ohh. [approaches SpongeBob and Krabby Patty] Why the long faces?
Krabby Patty: Aw, pickle chips. All I want is to be eaten.
SpongeBob: [slouching on table] Ohh. But we just can't find the perfect mouth.
Sandy: Well...oh! Maybe SpongeBob could give you the ol' [makes eating motions with hands] bite and chew.
Krabby Patty: [opens SpongeBob's mouth]
SpongeBob: Ahh.
Krabby Patty: [looking inside SpongeBob's mouth] Great teeth, [SpongeBob's tongue turns into a flexing bicep] healthy tongue... [minty breath comes out of the mouth and kisses it] Minty-fresh breath. Spread my ketchup, the perfect mouth! It would be an honor, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [eyes tearing up] Oh, no, Krabby Patty. The honor is mine.
Krabby Patty: Bon appétit, friend. [SpongeBob picks it up and starts putting it to his mouth]
Bubble Bass: Halt! [kicks SpongeBob out the way with his butt, picks up Krabby Patty] I deserve this patty. I'm clearly the hungriest. [holds out belly, then gets hit with pie]
[The clown picks up Krabby Patty and honks his horn. The other candidates start fighting over the patty, creating a fighting cloud.]
SpongeBob and Sandy: [backing away, but get dragged into the cloud] Whoa!
[The fighting cloud jumps all over the place, while Squidward is ignoring the fight. Krabby Patty crawls out of the cloud.]
Krabby Patty: All this for little old me. Ha-ha. Why, if you'd told me when I was a lifeless pile of ingredients that someday I'd... [Gary eats it, everyone stops fighting]
Everyone: Huh?
Gary: [swallows patty]
Sandy: Welp, I guess it got what it wanted.
SpongeBob: So, Gary, [nudges Gary with elbow] how was it?
Gary: [burps, slithers away]
SpongeBob: Wow.
Bubble Bass: Halt! [points to Sandy, everyone else angry] I blame the squirrel for this fracas. She made us turn on each other with her wicked, wicked science. [everyone starts shouting at Sandy]
Sandy: Well, science giveth, and science taketh away. [uses her Anthropomorphizer to turn a barrel sentient and rides away on it] Take me away, science. Yee-haw!

He narrates the events that led up to it: yesterday, he was relaxing in his backyard when SpongeBob distracted him with digging a hole in his backyard. SpongeBob explains that he is making a pool and invites Squidward to join when it is finished. Squidward refuses and goes back to relaxation, only to see SpongeBob finish his pool a few seconds later, with it coming out impressive and well-built. Squidward is overcome by jealousy as SpongeBob and Patrick begin playing in the pool.Squidward tries to distract himself with painting, but paints a pool shaped like his head instead. His air conditioner breaks, leaving him sweating heavily from the heat. That night, he hallucinates the pool beckoning to him and decides to sneak out and swim. After a brief encounter with Gary, he realizes that SpongeBob is preparing to go to bed, leaving him to swim in peace. He climbs onto a pool float and goes into a dream of him playing the clarinet for a crowd of party guests. When he awakes, it is morning, and he realizes he spent all night in the pool.When SpongeBob and Patrick run out to use the pool, Squidward tries to hide. He goes into the pool shed and disguises himself as a pool toy. Patrick mistakes him for one and inflates him, as he and SpongeBob play in the pool. Finally having enough, Squidward comes untied and sadly admits to SpongeBob that he is jealous of the pool. SpongeBob reminds him that he is welcome and offers him a jump off the diving board. As Squidward is caught in his pool party fantasy, SpongeBob and Patrick turn up the adjustable diving board. This leaves Squidward in outer space, and he shouts that it is too high. As he clings to the underside of the board, Patrick pulls the lever out and sends the board falling. Squidward slams into the surface of the water as SpongeBob and Patrick compliment his dive. Squidward's body then falls apart and his head is sucked into the pool filter.",Swimming Fools,"[The episode begins with Squidward floating with his face down in a swimming pool.]
Squidward: [narrating] Well, here I am floating face down in a swimming pool. I always wanted a pool, and in the end, I got one. How did I get here? Well, it all started yesterday.
[The scene flashes back to yesterday in the backyards of SpongeBob's, Squidward's, and Patrick's houses, with SpongeBob digging a square hole and Squidward bathing in the sun. Squidward takes a sip of his lemonade and exhales with his mouth until dirt projectiles into it.]
Squidward: [coughs up the dirt and growls angrily as he walks towards SpongeBob] Sponge- [as SpongeBob continues digging up the hole, dirt lands into Squidward's mouth again and spits it out. SpongeBob stops digging] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob throws the shovel which hits Squidward away]
[Squidward is heard groaning and SpongeBob pops out of the hole. Squidward is now seen on the ground with the shovel on his face.]
SpongeBob: Uh, Squidward, did you say something?
Squidward: [removes the shovel from his face, giving him a new mold of his head] Why are you digging up your yard?
SpongeBob: I'm putting in a pool!
Squidward: [his head reverts back to the original shape] A pool? [grumbles as he walks to it and makes a disgusted sound at the hole]
SpongeBob: [slides up next to Squidward] Mmm-hmmm! And I'm going to invite [rubs his gloves on Squidward's head, leaving dirt behind] my favorite next-door neighbor as soon as it's ready!
Squidward: Get off me! [wipes the dirt off his face] I wouldn't be caught dead in your muddy little bacteria hole! [walks away] I only swim in sophisticated pools.
SpongeBob: [waves at Squidward] Well if you change your mind, It's almost done!
Squidward: [lays back at his lounge chair] Ha. Yeah, sure. [puts on his sunglasses as he sighs happily, pours himself a glass of lemonade and drinks some of it]
SpongeBob: It's done! [Squidward takes off his sunglasses looking annoyed]
[A shot of SpongeBob's pool is shown, complete with a diving board, two lounge chairs, two torches, three palm trees, a rubber horse, a fountain, and a beach ball.]
Squidward: [spits out his lemonade] What the? Why, it's beautiful... [squeezes his glass of lemonade in frustration as he growls] Why does he get to have a pool? If anyone around here deserves a pool, it's me!
Patrick: Cannonball! [dives off the diving board and lands into the pool]
[Patrick's weight was so strong it causes all off the water in the pool to turn into a wave which crashes on Squidward, sending him inside his house. After the water clears, Squidward walks outside angrily.]
SpongeBob: [in the pool with a ring float] Hey, Squidward! [points to the pool with both of his index fingers] Come join us in the pool!
Patrick: [emerges head from the pool] Quick, while the water's still wet!

Patrick: Cannonball! [a cannon shot is heard, then a cannonball hits Squidward's face]
SpongeBob: [heard off-screen] Uh-oh!
Squidward: [gets up from the floor and the cannonball lands on his foot] Ouch! [hops to his AC as he holds his foot] Who needs a soggy old pool when you have the luxury and elegance of indoor air conditioning. [kisses the air conditioner and it breaks. Squidward quickly starts sweating and looks at the viewers] Phew! It's a little hot... [looks at his clock which melts due to the heat] Huh?
[The sun transitions into the moon. Patrick leaves SpongeBob's house wet.]
Patrick: That is one cool pool, ma fool! Ah-see you tomorrow, [starts swimming away] SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [waves] Swim safely, Patrick! Meet you at the pool! [closes his door]
[The camera pans to Squidward's house, then fades into Squidward laying down on his bed sweating.]

Squidward: What? Huh, who said that? [walks to his window, which appears to be glowing]
SpongeBob's pool: [glows while talking] Don't be a drip, take a dip! [laughs a bit] You know you want to.

SpongeBob: [yelling from his window] Gary! You leave those sea bunnies alone and come to bed!
Gary: [growls at Squidward and slaps his nose]
Squidward: Ow!
Gary: [continues growling as he slithers back inside using the pet door.]
Squidward: [looks at SpongeBob's window where the light closes and sighs in relief] Now I can have the pool all to myself! [swims backwards into an inflatable chair] Oh, pool... [starts to sleep and the scene fades into his dream where many octopus guests are at SpongeBob's pool] Ciao, everybody!
Guests: Ciao, Squidwardo!
Guest #1: [with an Italian accent] Squidwardo, you must play your clarinet for us! You simply must!
Squidward: I'll think about it! [gets up from the inflatable chair and dives into the pool]
[The guests awes in disappointment but then sees Squidward emerging from the pool playing his clarinet on many large white platforms.]
Squidward: [swims as he continues playing his clarinet and the camera pans out to a view of the floor of the pool, which is Squidward's head]
Pool floor: Ciao bella!
[As Squidward plays his clarinet, two mermaids appear on both sides and kiss his head, until the scene fades to reality with Squidward kissing until he falls off the inflatable chair and into the pool.]
Squidward: Egads! I must've fallen asleep! [SpongeBob and Patrick are heard laughing] Huh? [swims away from the pool] I can't let them find me here! [runs inside the pool shed to hide and closes the door on his tentacle, which his pulls back in. Squidward watches the two inside]
SpongeBob: Ooh, I can't wait to get wet!
Patrick: Hey, where's the pool toys?
Squidward: Oh, not the pool shed, not the pool shed, not the pool shed!
SpongeBob: They're in the pool shed, silly!
Squidward: Eep! Gotta hide, gotta hide, gotta hide! [runs to the toys]
SpongeBob: [barges into the pool shed] Toys, toys, toys! Okay, Patrick, you can pick first.
Patrick: Hmm, [many toys are shown, and Squidward is cosplaying as one] which toy, which toy, which toy?
Squidward: [in his thoughts] Not me, not me, not me!
Patrick: [grabs Squidward's nose] I'll take this big ugly one! [chuckles, then shakes Squidward around] It's too floppy to float on! It needs more air. [grabs Squidward's lips, licks his own, puckers them, inhales, inflates Squidward and ties his lips] That oughta do it!

Patrick: Aw, it's broken! [tears up]

SpongeBob and Patrick: Ride the wave! Ride the wave! Yeah!
[Squidward is seen suffocating under the pool as the scene wipes to SpongeBob and Patrick pulling tug of war with Squidward.]

Patrick: Tug it forth! [tugs Squidward's other arm] Tug it forth!! [tugs so hard SpongeBob loses his grip and Patrick gets hit by Squidward, sending them both down the pool. Patrick is seen swimming backwards while Squidward sinks]

Patrick: SpongeBob, watch this! [bounces on the diving board] Black hole! [dives into the pool with so much velocity that he sucks the entire neighborhood into a black hole. After a moment, everything gets sucked back to normal]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughs] Again, again! [Patrick chuckles]
Squidward: [pushed to his limit, he unties his lips and screams ""Enough!"" as he deflates] It's me ! I was the pool toy, you idiots!
[SpongeBob and Patrick look at each other.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, that's the greatest magic trick I've ever seen!
Patrick: Yeah! Let's do it again! [grabs Squidward's lips and inhales, but Squidward smacks Patrick's hand]
Squidward: [sighs] Look SpongeBob, I admit it. I used your pool without permission, because I'm really jealous of it. I want [camera pans to the pool chairs] your pool chairs, [camera pans to the pool jets] I want your pool jets, [camera pans to the pool noodles and a pool toy] I want your pool noodles, [camera pans to the diving board; he walks to it] and most of all, I want this diving board. [starts crying hysterically]
SpongeBob: [pats Squidward's back] Squidward, we're best neighbors! You can use my pool anytime you like, day or night, ya silly!
Squidward: [chuckles] Ah, gee. Thanks, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Say, [flaps Squidward's nose with his finger] how would you like to take a divey-wivey on the boardy-woardy, hmm?
Squidward: Oh no, thanks, but I just couldn't!
SpongeBob: [with an Italian accent] Please, you must take a dive, Squidwardo!
Squidward: Huh? [with an Italian accent] I would love to take a dive! [climbs the diving ladder] I was on my high school swim team!
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! This ladder is adjustable! Do you wanna go higher ?
Squidward: [with an Italian accent] I love you all too!
SpongeBob: Okay, I'll take that as a yes! Crank it up, Patrick!
[Patrick adjusts the ladder, making Squidward leave the surface all the way to outer space.]
Squidward: Ciao bella! I dive! [dives, then freezes in mid-air when he opens his eyes to see the entire Earth, his eyes bug out as he screams. He pants in distress then clings under the diving board] Troppo elevato! Too high, too high!
SpongeBob: Oh, it's too high, Patrick! Crank it down!
[Patrick snaps the crank off, then shrugs. The board moves slightly.]
Squidward: Huh? What was that? [he is sent flying down with the board and starts screaming]
[As Squidward is heard screaming, Patrick tries placing the crank back, then he places it on top of the crank lift.]
Patrick: [sighs happily, then when the crank falls off, he sighs disappointed]
[Squidward continues falling down and the crank lift is on fire. SpongeBob tries to put out the fire by making a water ball and throwing it at the fire, but it doesn't work. A detailed screaming Squidward is shown continuously falling then catching fire, and a quick POV of him is shown slamming into the pool.]
SpongeBob: [holds up a 10 score] Yay!
Patrick: [holds up a score with the letter G on it] Yeah!
[As Squidward floats face down, SpongeBob approaches to next to him.]
SpongeBob: Perfect dive, Squidward!
Squidward: [appears floating face down like he was earlier in the episode narrating] And that's how I got here.
[Squidward's body parts detach and his head gets sucked by the pool filter, blocking it.]

Squidward complains about Bubble Bass for being gross, then is about to say something about SpongeBob, only to be told by a stagehand that his show is being ended early. In its place is a show called Fun-Believable with Rube, where he highlights interesting sights around Bikini Bottom. He visits Sandy Cheeks' treedome, only for SpongeBob and Patrick to interrupt him, asking to show him something cool. They eventually get nervous and leave, and Sandy's treedome outfits Rube with a water helmet, then lets him in.Sandy shows her ""secret skill"": holding the record for the most nuts stored in her cheeks. She demonstrates, and SpongeBob and Patrick run in, accidentally crashing into Rube. He is swallowed whole by Sandy, along with the rest of the nuts, but agrees to let them on the show later.Next, Rube goes to Nosferatu's castle. Slappy throws his head to start a Rube Goldberg machine, ending in an advertisement for Fizzy Fang soda. Rube is impressed, and SpongeBob and Patrick rise out of two coffins. However, they are not yet ready and go back to hiding.Rube then goes to Baby Prunes' house, where she and Mary live. Baby Prunes tells Rube that she used to be wilder and more active in her youth, and Rube doubts it. Baby Prunes proves it by taking a helicopter around town. Rube enjoys the flight, but she begins driving it out of control. Perch Perkins and his grandmother are reporting on a traffic pile-up when Baby Prunes' helicopter bumps into theirs. Arguing over who is older, Mrs. Perkins and Baby Prunes get into a fight. Perch jumps out of the helicopter, while Rube stays to report. The helicopters crash and fall into Glove World!, where Mary and Perch are waiting for them. As they are taken away in wheelchairs, Mrs. Perkins disintegrates into dust, making Baby Prunes realize that she really was the oldest.As Rube is signing off, SpongeBob and Patrick state that they are ready to show him their trick. They morph their bodies into the word ""Fun-Believable,"" delighting Rube. Squidward, on his show, shouts ""Horrible!"" and turns it off.",FUN-Believable,"[The text ""Everyone is Horrible"" appears over a grayscale burst background.]
Announcer: And now with an editorial, here's Squidward Tentacles.
[Squidward sits behind a desk in his house.]
Squidward: Good evening. Everyone continues to be horrible, and I've got the proof. Here are my ""Beefs of the week.""
[A screen with the show's title is shown next to Squidward. He presses a remote to show a clip of Bubble Bass, with his eyes covered by a censor bar, eating chum and sausage at the Krusty Krab register.]
Squidward: Our first beef is, this filthy foodie always eats before he pays. Then he gives me a handful of money slathered in slimy grease.
[Bubble Bass sets his bucket of chum on the register while searching his pockets, and the bucket spills. He takes a stained, crumpled dollar bill and gives it to Squidward, then eats a handful of chum from the floor.]
Bubble Bass: [burps]
Squidward: [pauses the video] Horrible. Next.
[The screen switches to a frame of SpongeBob with his eyes censored.]
Squidward: Ho-ho, boy, do I have a beef with this annoying guy.
[A stagehand comes in and whispers to Squidward.]
Squidward: What? [pauses] I'm done? [pulls down chart with images of Patrick, Old Man Walker, Granny Tentacles, and a kid] But I've got 47 more beefs! [puts the chart up and sighs] Typical. [reads paper] Coming up next, it's ""Fun-Believable"" with... Rube Goldfish!?
[An image of Rube, with censor bars over his eyes, appears on the screen.]
Squidward: Huh? Oh, no. That guy puts mustard in his milkshakes. Horrible! [the screen grows and pushes him away] Whoa, whoa, hey, watch it!
[The screen flashes to show Rube in an inner tube. He throws the censor bar away.]
Rube: Well, hello, everybody! I'm Rube Goldfish, and today we'll be exploring the amazing and unknown Bikini Bottom!
[Rube jumps out of the inner tube and the title of his show appears next to him.]
Rube: Warning: what you are about to see is gonna make you say, ""That's fun-believable.""
[Slides show Rube cutting a topiary. Rube paints a picture as the slide shows Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Rube cooks on a barbecue grill as the slide shows the Diner. Rube repairs a TV as the slide shows Shady Shoals. Rube paints a picture of a fish as the slide shows the Fry Cook Museum. Rube wears a safari outfit and holds binoculars as the slide shows Sandy's treedome. Rube changes once more, spraying a garden hose. The screen zooms into the image of the treedome.]
Rube: We're here at Sandy Cheeks' treedome, because--
[SpongeBob and Patrick eagerly fidget in place.]
SpongeBob: Um, excuse us, Rube, but... [giggles]
Rube: [points] The public restroom is right around the corner, boys.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick and I have something to show you. It's [spreads arms] ""fun-believable."" [chuckles]
Rube: Really? Well, that's just what I'm looking for. Show us what you got!
[SpongeBob and Patrick freeze up with blank expressions. They glance at each other, then run into the distance and huddle.]
SpongeBob: [whispering] Okay, you ready?
Patrick: [whispering] I think so.
SpongeBob: [whispering] This is our chance.
Patrick: [whispering, excited] Oh, you don't have to tell me, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [whispering, quickly] All right, all right, all right...
Patrick: [whispering] Is he still there?
SpongeBob: [whispering] Let's check.
[They glance behind them and go back to huddling.]
Patrick: [whispering] Okay, he's still there.
SpongeBob: [whispering] You ready?
Patrick: [whispering] Yeah.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [whispering] One... two... [they run up to Rube] We're ready! [they skid, look at each other, and run away, worried] We're not ready!
Rube: [waving] Okay, come back when you are! [to camera] Must be camera shy. [a robot arm from the treedome grabs him] Yipe! Would you look at that? Amazing. [the hand puts a water helmet on him, then shoots him into the dome] Whoa! [he falls down a tree and his underwear gets caught on a branch]
Sandy: Howdy do, Rube?
Rube: [chuckles] Howdy, Miss Cheeks. Now, if the robotic arms weren't ""fun-believable"" enough, I understand that you have a secret skill that nobody knows about.
Sandy: That's right, Rube. I hold the [takes out acorn trophy] squirrel record for the most nuts stored in my cheeks.
Rube: Wow. Can you give us a demonstration?
Sandy: Sure can. I just happened to have some hazelnuts handy.
[Sandy pulls a lever that makes a chute come down and fill her mouth with nuts.]
Rube: Ooh!
Sandy: Ahh-ahh!
Rube: Wow, impressive! I don't think it's possible to fit any more than that!
Sandy: [mouth full] You ain't seen nuttin' yet.
[She uses a remote to extend the tube, and it shoots nuts into her mouth faster.]
Sandy: Ahh-ahh-ahhh-ahhh!
Rube: Wow!
[Sandy's cheeks are full of acorns.]
Rube: Fun-believable!
[The doorbell rings.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh, Rube? [kick the door down and run in] We're ready! We're ready! We're ready!
Rube: Well, folks, it looks like--
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're ready! We're ready!
[They run into Rube, knocking him into the pile of acorns in Sandy's mouth.]
Rube: Ahh-ahh!
[Sandy closes her mouth and swallows the acorns.]
Sandy: [groaning] Ugh. I think I have a nut-ache.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Sorry, Sandy.
SpongeBob: [shouting] Hey, Rube, should we come back later?
Rube: [gives thumbs up from inside Sandy's stomach] Yeah, later would be good!
[Rube slides by and transitions to Nosferatu's castle. Lightning strikes. Rube stands next to Nosferatu and Slappy and speaks into a microphone.]
Rube: We're here at Nosferatu's castle. [another Rube comes in from the side of the screen]
Second Rube: Which is a historical landmark in Bikini Bottom, by the way!
Rube: Well, thanks, Rube! [kicks him away and turns to Nosferatu] But why are we here today, Mr. Nosferatu? Could you give us a hint? [winks]
Nosferatu: [hisses]
Slappy: The master wants to show you his-- heh-heh-heh-- pain-reaction-- oh, I mean chain-reaction machine. [cackling]
[Nosferatu slaps Slappy and giggles, then turns into a bat.]
Rube: So how does this crazy contraption work, anyway?
Slappy: Okay, Master, let it roll !
[Nosferatu removes Slappy's head.]
Rube: Oh. Oh, my. Ha-ha-ha.
[Nosferatu throws Slappy's head down the stairs. It bounces down the stairs. A suit of armor knocks it into a windmill. Slappy's head lands on a toy car, which drives forward and through some swinging blades. It rides down a pile of skulls and the car crashes into a skull, knocking Slappy's head past the moon. Nosferatu raises his eyebrows. Slappy's head lands in a pipe, rolls through the laundry chute, and through a spider web.]
Slappy: Mmm, snackies.
[The head bowls through a bunch of skeletons and lands in a basket. This lifts a basket full of bat jellyfish and a container of Fizzy Fang soda on the other end. As a bat jellyfish flies past the screen, Nosferatu grabs the soda and drinks it. He holds Slappy's head.]
Slappy: The master says, Rube's show is brought to you by Fizzy Fang soda. It tickles my teeth, heh-heh-heh.
Rube: [clapping] Fellas, that was truly fun-believable!
[Two coffins open being Rube. SpongeBob and Patrick, with blank eyes and sharp teeth and claws, hover out.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [ominously] We're ready for you, Rube.
SpongeBob: [hisses]
Rube: [playfully] Are you sure ?
[SpongeBob and Patrick look at each other, blink, and revert to their normal selves.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: No!
[They fall back into the coffins and shut them.]
Rube: [holds hands] I guess their moment has passed... [closes eyes, then gestures to coffins] away ! [laughs and slaps his knee] Whoo!
[Rube transitions to himself at the house of Mary and Baby Prunes.]
Rube: We're here with ""Baby Prunes."" [to her] Now, you're the oldest resident of Bikini Bottom. Isn't that right?
Baby Prunes: What are you, a cop?
Mary: [shouting] Ma, behave!
Baby Prunes: [shouting] He's interviewing me, Mary, so shut up!
Rube: [laughs] You are too much.
Baby Prunes: Honey, you should have seen me 70 years ago when I was middle-aged and wild! [coughing]
Rube: You're putting me on. How could a sweet little old lady like [points] you ever be wild?
Baby Prunes: [grabs Rube's shirt] That sounds like a challenge.
[Rube transitions to a blue helicopter in the sky. Rube is reporting and Baby Prunes controls it from the front seat.]
Rube: Holy helicopters! We are flying over Bikini Bottom, and the view is spectacular ! [looks down] Hello!
Townsfolk: [together] Hi, Rube!
Rube: Baby Prunes, I've never seen someone your age so [tips hat] amazingly active.
Baby Prunes: You call this active? I'll show you active! [pushes the helicopter forward so it dips down] Ah-ha-ha!
Rube: Whoa-oh-oh! [ducks in his seat] Mrs. Prunes, you don't have to go this fast to impress me!
Baby Prunes: This is your captain speaking. We're going down again! [laughs]
[The helicopter goes down and then flies forward as Rube screams.]
Rube: Eh... ohh! Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Whoa! Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ahhh! [sweating, nervously] Uh, that was the furthest thing from fun-believable.
Baby Prunes: You could have fooled me. [laughs] Huh? [looks ahead] Flapping Yaps at 12:00! [laughs and tilts helicopter forward]
Rube: [falls out of his seat and is pulled back by his seatbelt] Whoa-oh!
Baby Prunes: Ha-ha! Huh?
[There is a giant, burning pile-up of cars in a roundabout. Perch reports from his news helicopter.]
Perch: This thousand-boat pileup might be the greatest tragedy to ever befall Bikini Bottom. And I just want to thank my [puts her arm around her] great gram-gram for flying the copter today. She is the oldest citizen in Bikini Bottom at 115!
[Old Mrs. Perkins kisses Perch's cheek, leaving a lipstick mark. Baby Prunes drives the helicopter up to her.]
Baby Prunes: You are not the oldest citizen in Bikini Bottom! You're only 115! I'm 116!
Old Mrs. Perkins: Ooh, you fibber! If I wasn't your elder, [imitates a punch] I'd pop you right in the beezer!
Baby Prunes: I'm the oldest!
Old Mrs. Perkins: I'm the oldest!
[A hand comes out of Baby Prunes' helicopter and slaps Perch's helicopter, making it spin.]
Perch and Old Mrs. Perkins: Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Baby Prunes: I challenge you to a [black bars surround the screen] copter duel!
Old Mrs. Perkins: Oh, it's on! [shows her hearing aid under her headphones as black bars surround the screen] Like my hearing aid!
Perch and Rube: Copter duel!? No!
[The helicopters back up. Perch jumps out.]
Perch: This just iiiiin! TV news anchor Perch Perkins jumped out of a helicopter today! [takes out an umbrella and floats with it, then the umbrella collapses and makes him fall] Whoaaa!
[The helicopters get into position.]
Baby Prunes: This is a no-fly zone, sister!
[The helicopters bump into each other near a cloud.]
Rube: Whoa-oh-oh!
Baby Prunes: Hey, you! Get off of my cloud!
Old Mrs. Perkins: I'm the oldest!
Baby Prunes: I'm the oldest!
[They slam the helicopters together, making them fall.]
Rube: I'll have to change the name of this show from ""Fun-Believable"" to... Aaaah! [Glove World is seen] Ohh! [the helicopter crashes on a roller coaster] Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Baby Prunes: Whee!
[Everyone shouts as the helicopter rides on the roller coaster car. The car comes to a stop. Perch and Mary have wheelchairs ready.]
Perch: Time to go home, you two.
Mary: Yeah, that's enough excitement for today.
Baby Prunes, Rube, and Old Mrs. Perkins: Awww. [grumbling]
[They get into the wheelchairs and are pushed away.]
Baby Prunes: I'm the oldest!
Old Mrs. Perkins: I'm the oldest!
Baby Prunes: I am the oldest!
Old Mrs. Perkins: I'm the oldest! [she poofs into dust]
Baby Prunes: Huh, I guess she was the oldest. But I'm the oldest now! [chuckling]
Rube: [watches them exit, then turns to the camera] Well, we've come to end of our show, everybody. [turns his body around] And I just want to tell ya how fun-be--
[SpongeBob and Patrick run in.]
SpongeBob: [panting] We're ready, Rube!
Rube: It's now or never, fellas. Take it away!
[SpongeBob opens up Patrick's mouth and takes out a boombox. He presses a button. Dramatic music plays as they take deep breaths and brace themselves. Their bodies spiral up into the air. SpongeBob's body stretches into the sky. Patrick stretches his stomach sideways. SpongeBob's body and eyes fall apart.]
Rube: [looking on] Wow!
[Patrick's body curls into a spiral. SpongeBob and Patrick have their arms cross. Patrick's arm stretches out. Rube stares in amazement. Patrick forms the word ""Fun"", SpongeBob's pants are a dash, and SpongeBob forms the word ""Believable"".]
Rube: Ooh-hoo! Now, that's [points at the word] fun-believable ! [smiles]
[The scene is shown on Squidward's screen.]

Gary is unimpressed with the house, but SpongeBob remains excited. That evening, SpongeBob calls Gary inside, but he refuses to leave. Gary makes renovations to the house overnight, with the sound disrupting Squidward's sleep. SpongeBob yells that Gary is responsible for the loud noise, but he mishears and accuses Larry of making it instead.The next morning, SpongeBob sees that Gary has built a small replica of SpongeBob's pineapple house. Gary dresses as SpongeBob, with Spot as his pet snail. SpongeBob is overwhelmed by the cuteness. Just then, he sees a smaller version of Squidward's house, inhabited by a grouchy urchin with Squidward's nose. Squidward comes out and trips over the rock of a Patrick-like slug. Much like SpongeBob, Squidward and Patrick fawn over how cute the animals are.SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward watch their animal counterparts play, and wind up sleeping outside overnight. In the morning, Mr. Krabs comes in and calls his employees in to work. A Mr. Krabs-like sea bunny then hires Gary to work at a miniature Krusty Krab, which gets flooded by nematodes. When offered a spatula and told to work, Gary feels overwhelmed and decides to return to his normal life. He smashes the spatula and pushes the houses away with a bulldozer. SpongeBob welcomes Gary back into his house, along with the animal versions of Patrick and Squidward.",Gary's Playhouse,"[The episode opens with Gary, holding a pillow, getting onto SpongeBob's sofa and grabs a blanket with his mouth. He circles around and begins to sleep under the fort.]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Oh, Gary!

SpongeBob: [off-screen] Come outside. I've got a surprise for you.
Gary: [grumbles, opens SpongeBob's front door and slithers to see a giant gift box that SpongeBob is leaning against] Meow?
SpongeBob: You're gonna love this, Gary, [spins around and makes a heart with his hands] really love it. You ready? [kicks the gift box away to reveal a playhouse] Ta-da! It's a playhouse just for you. Now you're a homeowner just like me, minus the mortgage payments.
Gary: [sniffing playhouse] Blah!

[Bubble transition to the next morning at the same place. SpongeBob is snoring, and a clam on top of his house crows. Another clam crows on top of Gary's playhouse. Patrick is sucking and drooling on Squidward, holding his nose, as they are all still asleep.]
Squidward: [in his sleep] Knock it off.
Mr. Krabs: [off-screen] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob and Squidward wake up as he angrily approaches them] Squidward! Where were you two yesterday? I had to manage, run the register, and cook all day, all by meself!
[Cutaway to Mr. Krabs at the Krusty Krab yesterday, where he is attempting to do everything on his own. He is flipping burnt Krabby Patties as the cash register is burning hot on the stove. He opens up the register, and throws red hot coins at the customers.]
Mr. Krabs: Here ya go!
Customers: [angry, they catch the hot coins, which burn their hands] Hot, hot, hot, hot!
[The cutaway ends.]
Mr. Krabs: Have you ever had to handle hot change? [close-up of claws, which have coin indents on them]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I guess we got carried away watching our animal double-gaggers all day.
Squidward: That's doppelgangers.
Patrick: [suddenly waking up] No, I believe it's pronounced bubble hangers.
Mr. Krabs: What are you [facepalms] barnacle brains blabbering about?
[A sea bunny wearing red oven mitts starts mumbling like Mr. Krabs, and the real Mr. Krabs looks over to see him bang on Gary's house.]
Mr. Krabs: What in Neptune's creation is that? [eyes merge in a heart shape] Ooh, and why is it so adorable? [waving claw as he sits on bench] Scooch over.
[Gary comes out of his playhouse, and BunnyKrabs puts a worker's hat on him.]
BunnyKrabs: [grumbling, pointing right]
Gary: Meow, meow! [he and BunnyKrabs start walking to the right]
Mr. Krabs: Whoo-hoo! Go, Krabsy! [sees Gary and BunnyKrabs walk over to a miniature version of the Krusty Krab] Ooh, a tiny little Krusty Krab.
BunnyKrabs: [looks cutesy at Mr. Krabs] Yeah. [goes inside]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs: Too cute. Too cute. Too cute. Too cute. Too cute. Too cute. Too cute. Too cute.
[Inside the miniature Krusty Krab, Spot and PatSlug are at a table, with PatSlug using his eye to scratch himself. SquidUrchin is at the register, reading a book. BunnyKrabs pushes Gary to the kitchen and leaves. Everyone is now huddled around the tiny Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, boy. What's next?
Patrick: I gotta know!
[A bunch of tiny suitcase buses drive to the tiny Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Aw, an adorable tour group.
Nematodes: Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry.
[The buses empty out several nematodes, which enter the restaurant. They start surrounding the register.]
SquidUrchin: [screams, panics, then screams again]
BunnyKrabs: [barges into kitchen with Hydro-Dynamic Spatula, grumbling, activates spatula, and giving it to Gary]
Patrick: [pointing] Ooh, I think I've seen this one.
Squidward: I think I've lived this one.
Mr. Krabs: [pats SpongeBob's head] This was where me boy-o really came through.
SpongeBob: My shining moment.
[The nematodes are bouncing Gary's friends on top of them.]
Gary: Meow, meow, meow.
BunnyKrabs: [sweating, scared]
Gary: [sighs, breaks spatula] Meow! [angrily leaves]
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
SpongeBob: I don't remember this part.
[Gary comes back with a miniature bulldozer, and bulldozes all of the buildings. He leaves everything behind, including his yellow box shell.]
Gary: Meow. [wiping eye stalks] Meow, meow, meow, meow. [sighs, goes back inside SpongeBob's house] Meow, meow, meow, meow. [door closes]
SpongeBob: Huh. [points to himself] I guess there's only room for one me.
Squidward: [points to himself] Or me.
Mr. Krabs: [shrugs] Or me.
Two Patricks: [pointing to themselves] Or us.
[Bubble transition back to Gary's original sleeping position, where he is snoring. SpongeBob is reading a book and looks at Gary.]
SpongeBob: Nice to have you back inside, Gary.
Gary: Meow. [goes back to sleep]
SpongeBob: [looking at SquidUrchin and PatSlug, who are on a pillow in a box] Oh, it's nice to have you two here as well.
[SquidUrchin kicks PatSlug, who kicks him back. They push against each other, then rub each other as they sleep on each other.]

He soon finds SpongeBob inside his house, celebrating the anniversary of his friendship with Squidward. SpongeBob shows Squidward various memories he had with him, but Squidward angrily kicks him out afterwards.After being jump scared by SpongeBob later in the day, Squidward tries to avoid him while walking through Bikini Bottom, but SpongeBob continuously manages to find him and tries to make new memories with him. Later, Squidward arrives at the Krusty Krab, where SpongeBob is at first nowhere to be seen, but soon shows up to surprise him, causing Squidward to run out of the restaurant, where he continues to see SpongeBob through hallucinations.Later, at his house, Squidward is panicking about SpongeBob remembering everything about the two's interactions. He soon gets the idea to erase SpongeBob's memories of him. Squidward sneaks into SpongeBob's house to access the memory book to erase himself from SpongeBob's memories, as well as from his brain.The following morning, Squidward checks through Bikini Bottom to see if SpongeBob is around, but he is not around. He sees SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab, where the two greet each other, although SpongeBob no longer knows Squidward. Mr. Krabs notices that Squidward is happy, and Squidward shares that he erased SpongeBob's memories of him. Outraged, Mr. Krabs tells Squidward that this is actually bad news, since SpongeBob had the combination to the safe with the Krabby Patty secret formula attached to a memory with Squidward as the only way to prevent Plankton from scanning Krabs' mind and stealing the secret recipe to the Chum Bucket; when Squidward erased his memories of him, he erased his memory of the combination as well. As a result, Mr. Krabs forces SpongeBob and Squidward to spend time with each other to relive the two's interactions and get his memory back, so he remembers the combination.Squidward takes SpongeBob around town to relive SpongeBob's former memories of him, but they all prove to be unsuccessful at first. Squidward's last resort to get SpongeBob to remember him is going on the Sushi-Maker, combined with some other memories, which ultimately causes SpongeBob to remember him, and the combination to the Krusty Krab safe as a result. SpongeBob shaking the ladder causes Squidward to go through the Sushi-Maker. At the Krusty Krab, where Squidward is shown injured, SpongeBob realizes he celebrated the ""friendiversary"" a day early and prepares the celebrations again, but is still unsure of when the exact day of the anniversary is.",Friendiversary,"[The episode opens with a shot of Squidward's house, SpongeBob's house, and Patrick's house at night. Squidward is asleep in his bedroom, snoring. He hears crashing noises and wakes up.]
Squidward: Huh? [the curls on his head fall off, and he takes off his sleep mask] [gasps] Intruders. A break-in.
[Squidward angrily picks up a can of hairspray and sprays it.]
Squidward: I knew this can of hairspray would come in handy one day. [opens the door and goes downstairs; more crashing is heard] Who's down there? I have an aerosol can and I'm not afraid to use it.
[Squidward trips on a balloon and falls down the stairs. At the bottom, the can of hairspray hits his head and sprays him in the face, which makes him scream.]
Squidward: My eyes! [pulls lamp cord and rubs his eyes] Huh? [looks around the room to see party decorations, including a sculpture of him and SpongeBob and a banner] ""Happy friend-i-ver""...
SpongeBob: [in Squidward's face] Happy friend-iversary, Squidward! [blows a party horn with confetti at him. Squidward spits out the confetti]
Squidward: SpongeBob, what time is it?
SpongeBob: It's one minute after midnight on the day that we first met. [grabs a book] It's all here in my Squidward memory book.
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: [sits down next to Squidward and flips through the pages] Here's us at camp. Here's when I moved in right next door. Oh, and here's when I got Employee of the Month instead of you again. Here's one I took a few minutes ago. Look at you. Just like an angel.
Squidward: [swipes the book away] All right, that's it! [throws SpongeBob out of the door] Get out! [kicks SpongeBob out]
SpongeBob: [waving] Okay, see you around, friend. [scoots on his butt back to his house] ♪Friend, friend, friend, friend, friend, friend, friend, friend, friend, friend, friend, friend-iversary!♪ [enters his house]
[The ""Friendiversary"" banner falls onto Squidward. Bubble transition to Squidward using a dustpan and broom to clean up the party decorations. He then takes the trash to his trash cans outside, to which SpongeBob startles him.]
SpongeBob: Happy friend-iversary!
[Squidward screams and jumps into the trash can.]
SpongeBob: Remember the first time I startled you into this trash can?
Squidward: [runs away with the trash can on him] Ahh, go away! Go away! [bumps into a piece of coral, Patrick's house, and Patrick's mailbox. He then rolls on the ground]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Classic Squiddy. [takes a picture, which is then shown in his memory book] [sighs] Memories.
[Bubble transition to Squidward tiptoeing in town, scared.]
Squidward: Is he here? Is he here? [groans, then looks around] Phew. Not here.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! [Squidward's eyes widen as he looks up] [playing a piano attached to a rope] Remember that time I dedicated a song to you? [the rope snaps, and the piano crushes Squidward. SpongeBob continues playing, and Squidward shows up on the sheet music] Oh, you do remember.
[Squidward launches out of the piano, and face plants on the ground.]
Squidward: [runs away] Leave me be! [pants as he reaches a toy store]
SpongeBob: [knocks on the glass, holding a pair of skates] Remember the time I got you these rocket skates?
Squidward: Uh, no.
SpongeBob: That's because we're making a new memory. [points to Squidward's feet, which now have the rocket skates]
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: [waving frantically] Happy friend-iversary!
[Squidward's rocket skates take off and leave him spinning in the air. He explodes into a heart-shaped firework. SpongeBob takes a picture with a camera. Bubble transition to Squidward crawling to the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: [opening the door] SpongeBob? [he looks at all the customers eating their Krabby Patties, then crawls under a table] SpongeBob? [peeks into a customer's patty] SpongeBob? [looks in the register boat] SpongeBob? [hesitantly opens the cash register to see no SpongeBob. He then looks in the kitchen and doesn't see SpongeBob. He puts on his work hat and begins reading a magazine, and immediately hears SpongeBob laugh. Squidward looks in the magazine] Phew. [opens up a page with Kelpy G playing his clarinet] Oh, the Kelpy G concert. Now that was a good memory. [he gets an idea and takes out a magnifying glass to inspect the pages] Hmm. [he zooms in on himself and sees SpongeBob below him] ""Remember, this, Squidward?"" [The SpongeBob on the magazine winks. Squidward screams as a bunch of party decorations explode on him]
SpongeBob: [pushes a device that opens up a Squidward inflatable tube man, with him on top] Happy friend-iversary!
Squidward: [screams and runs out of the Krusty Krab. He sees a billboard of him and SpongeBob on a Kelp Soda ad] Huh?
SpongeBob: Remember this, Squidward?
Squidward: [an old picture of him and SpongeBob in Bikini Bottom hits him in the face] Huh?
SpongeBob: Remember this, Squidward?
Squidward: Huh? [looks up to see a blimp with a screen of him and SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Remember this, Squidward?
Squidward: [runs to a nearby police car] Please, you've gotta help me!
[Two policemen pop out, with the faces of him and SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob policeman: Remember this, Squidward?
Squidward: [backing away] Oh, no, no, no! [screams]
SpongeBob's voice: [repeatedly] Happy friend-iversary. Friend-iversary. Friend-iversary.
[A ""Later That Evening"" timecard appears.]
French Narrator: Happy friend-iversary.
[The scene changes to a rainy night shot of SpongeBob and Squidward's houses. Thunder rumbles. Squidward is seen huddled in a corner in his kitchen, shivering.]
Squidward: [panicking] He remembers everything. Everything that happened. Even things that didn't happen. Maybe even things that will happen. [gasps] Things that will never happen. If he remembers it, it happens.
[Squidward enters the fireplace.]
Squidward: Get a hold of yourself, Squidward. [sits on the chair; he stands up, pacing] There's got to be a way out. There's got to be a way to erase...
[Squidward dashes into his art room and rummages through a chest. He picks up a pencil.]
Squidward: An eraser! I'll erase his memories of me. [giggles] [his face changes and does an evil laugh]
[The scene changes to Squidward in a burglar outfit on top of SpongeBob's house. He opens the top trapdoor and slides down via rope. He goes over to SpongeBob's memory book of him and uses the eraser on his pencil to erase all evidence of him in the book.]
Squidward: There's only one more place he keeps his memories.
[Squidward goes into SpongeBob's room, where he is sleeping. Squidward inserts the pencil eraser into one of SpongeBob's holes.]
Squidward: Erase me. Erase me. [rubs the eraser onto SpongeBob's brain shaped like Squidward]
SpongeBob: [asleep] Oh, Squidward, let's be roommates and live together forever and ever and ever.
[Squidward starts rubbing the eraser harder onto SpongeBob. Cut to the next morning, where Squidward opens his door and peeks out.]
Squidward: SpongeBob? [opens his trash can] SpongeBob? [now in downtown Bikini Bottom] SpongeBob? [opens the Krusty Krab door and peeks inside] SpongeBob? [opens the door again to see only one customer, who waves]
[Squidward puts on his hat and enters his register. He looks into the kitchen, where SpongeBob is cooking patties.]
Squidward: Ahem. Good morning.
SpongeBob: Oh, good morning. You must be the new cashier. Nice to meet you. [continues cooking patties]
Squidward: I can't believe it. It worked. [to SpongeBob] Uh, have we met before?
SpongeBob: I don't think so. Maybe we can chat later, huh? I'm kind of busy right now.
Squidward: This is the best day of my life!
Mr. Krabs: [walking to the register] Hmm, you seem weirdly happy for some reason. What's going on?
Squidward: Last night, I erased all of SpongeBob's memories of me. Isn't that wonderful?
Mr. Krabs: You... [yelling with rage along with bull roaring sound and grabbing Squidward] what?! Are you insane, man?! [grumbles and takes Squidward to his office]
[Squidward, with his face turned into a deep shade of blue, gasps for air as Mr. Krabs lets him go.]
Mr. Krabs: To keep Plankton from scanning me mind, SpongeBob is the only one who knows the [bangs safe] combination to the secret formula safe! [strangles Squidward] And because he never wanted to forget it, he attached it to a memory he had with you , Mr. Squidward! I want you to un-erase his memory right now ! [hollering] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [appears, saluting] Yes, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [putting his hands on both of them] Spend the afternoon with Mr. Squidward here. He's gonna share some precious memories with you.
SpongeBob: Oh, no thank you. I don't know this guy. He's a stranger. [to Mr. Krabs] Confidentially, he looks a little boring.
Mr. Krabs: You go with him. That's an order.
SpongeBob: [saluting] Yes, sir.
[Mr. Krabs growls as Squidward takes SpongeBob outside.]
SpongeBob: So what are we doing now, new guy?
Squidward: We're going to recreate your lost memories of me, so you can remember the combination of Krabs' safe.
SpongeBob: Huh, sounds crazy-pants, [shrugs] but okay.
Squidward: Just do what I tell you.
[Bubble transition to Squidward's trash cans. SpongeBob screams at Squidward as he takes out the trash, making him jump into the trash can. Squidward runs away with the trash can on his head.]
Squidward: Hmm?
SpongeBob: [shrugging and shaking his head] Mm-mm.
[Squidward flings SpongeBob on top of the piano from before, where he plays it. The rope snaps, and it crushes Squidward. SpongeBob opens up the music sheet, and Squidward is on it like before. Squidward groans.]
SpongeBob: [shrugging and shaking his head again] Mm-mm.
[Squidward gives SpongeBob a thumbs up through the toy store display window, and the rocket skates propel him into the air and turn him into a heart-shaped firework like before.]
SpongeBob: [shrugging and shaking his head again] Mm-mm.
[The scene cuts to SpongeBob and Squidward at a campfire from ""The Camping Episode."" SpongeBob holds a ukulele while sitting on a log. Squidward wears clown shoes, a hoop skirt, and a sombrero, with a flashlight and a tray full of cubed cheese in his hand while hooting diabolically. A sea bear comes from behind and attacks him. SpongeBob shrugs and shakes his head again.]
[The scene cuts to the two at Goo Lagoon. From a similar scene in ""Dying for Pie,"" Squidward wears a salmon suit in front of three kids. All the kids throw rocks at him.]
SpongeBob: [shrugging and shaking his head again] Mm-mm.
[The scene cuts to the two at a bubblestand from the ""Bubblestand"" episode. SpongeBob blows a bubble, while Squidward screams loudly into the bubble wand, blowing a massive bubble that lifts him off the ground. The bubble pops.]
SpongeBob: [shrugging and shaking his head again] Hmm, mm-mm.
[The scene cuts to a boat full of explosives driving over a bridge above Kelp Forest, where a clown bangs on the top window. Squidward is driving with a gag, SpongeBob is tied up in a rope injured, and there is a can of lima beans on the dashboard. SpongeBob opens a can of hot sauce with his mouth, and it lands on him. He strains, and the clown breaks into the car, screeching like a monkey. SpongeBob then explodes, sending them all down into the abyss. They scream as a black bulldozer truck falls as well. A green monster eats SpongeBob and Squidward, and the bulldozer crushes the monster, sending ashes everywhere. Squidward groans.]
SpongeBob: [shrugging] Meh.
[Bubble transition to sunset. Both Squidward and SpongeBob are wearing ridiculous outfits.]
Squidward: Alright, if this doesn't make you remember me [open shot of the Sushi-Maker from ""Life Insurance""] then nothing will.
SpongeBob: [holding a duck and wearing a silly top hat] Nope, it's just not ringing a --
[SpongeBob gasps as the camera zooms in onto his eyes as several memories of him and Squidward are quickly displayed on them; bell dings.]
SpongeBob: [whispers] Squidward. [full volume] Squidward, I remember this! I remember you! [shakes ladder] I remember the combination to the safe! [the duck walks away] Hooray, hooray! Hooray-ay-ay!
Squidward: [on the diving board] Yeah, that's great, just stop shaking the -- [screams as he falls off the diving board and into the tub of boiling lava. He screams and jumps in pain, hits the sideways spring, and bounces into a steel wall]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] The combination is [Squidward lands on the spiky conveyor belt's lever, which turns on] three impacts to the right. [Squidward lands onto the conveyor belt, which takes him to the rolling wheel with sharp corals on it]
Squidward: No, no, no, no, no, no. [a flower-shaped roller squashes him] My body.
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Five punchings to the left. [mechanical boxing gloves punch Squidward from above, making him yell in pain. He melts off the conveyor belt and lands on a shell seat. Four mechanical arms stretch him four ways] Six stretched limbs to the right.
[The arms squash Squidward into a ball, who is dropped into a SpongeBob-faced cannon, which shoots him through a ring of fire and hits a school bell. He falls to the ground.]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] And 56 school children to the left. [the school children trample Squidward] No, wait. That's not it. Oh, 57 ! [a giant orca school kid jumps on Squidward] Oh, Squidward, I remember! I remember!
Squidward: [weakly] Hooray.
[Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab. A police car passes by. At the register, Squidward is in a full body cast.]
SpongeBob: You know, Squidward, there's something else I remembered. Yesterday wasn't our friend-iversary. [the party decorations appear again] It's today!
Squidward: No. [SpongeBob brings out the same Squidward inflatable] No. Nooo!
SpongeBob: [sits on top of the inflatable] Happy friend-iversary! Or is it tomorrow? [thinks while he looks at the camera as the episode ends.]",0.13,Kaz

In the episode, Snail Fail works at Sir Urchin's house and cleans his priceless works of art. Snail Fail ends up smashing a painting into Sir Urchin, making him furious, as the audience laughs. Snail Fail continues to hit Sir Urchin with other objects, until he grows bored and suddenly gives a dramatic soliloquy about Sir Urchin's catchphrase: ""Why, you!"" The audience is surprised, and when Sir Urchin gets angry at him for not saying the right lines, Snail Fail declares that he wants to be a more serious actor, and quits his spot on the show.SpongeBob and Patrick decide to get the two back together. SpongeBob rides his unicycle to Snail Fail's house, while Patrick calls a taxi, only for Sir Urchin to be the driver. Patrick tells Sir Urchin that he is a fan of his show and repeatedly hits him with a hammer, giving Sir Urchin the idea to have Patrick be Snail Fail's replacement.Meanwhile, SpongeBob arrives at Snail Fail's house through the mail. He refuses to go back to Sir Urchin's show, so SpongeBob sets him up with a performance of Hamlet at Shady Shoals Rest Home, although the audience reacts negatively.Patrick and Sir Urchin re-enact the show on the street, but between their lack of an audience and Patrick's inability to remember his lines, it does not go over well. Sir Urchin and Snail Fail are both notified of an upcoming talent show, and separately agree to attend.Backstage, they run into each other, where SpongeBob and Patrick try to get them together. Snail Fail wants to perform with SpongeBob, while Sir Urchin is trying to go first with Patrick. Snail Fail takes Sir Urchin's monocle and smashes it, leading to a major fight between the two on stage. They smash each other with various objects, as they did on their show. At the end, they notice the audience, and Snail Fail says his catchphrase. The audience cheers, and Sir Urchin and Snail Fail agree to go back on the show, with some of Snail Fail's more dramatic acting included.On the next episode of the show, Snail Fail continues his Hamlet performance. He hits Sir Urchin with the skull he is holding, making the audience laugh again. SpongeBob and Patrick are glad that the show is back, and Sir Urchin and Snail Fail give a personal shout out to them, popping out of the TV screen.

Live-action audience: [laughing]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughing, rolling around]
Snail Fail: [running around with a bust] Whoa, dainty, dainty, dainty! [smashes it on him]
Sir Urchin: [with bust on head] Why, you!
Snail Fail: [smashes piano on him] What I do?
Sir Urchin: [with piano keys in mouth] Why, you!
Snail Fail: [smashes fountain on him] What I do?
Sir Urchin: [comes out of fountain] Why, you!
[Snail Fail looks bored. He steps away from Sir Urchin and begins a monologue under a spotlight.]
Snail Fail: Why you, indeed.
Sir Urchin: Huh? [falls off fountain]
Snail Fail: Why not any of us? If the nature of the universe is random, would not misfortune find us all equally? And yet, it does not. Perhaps you should stop asking, ""Why you?"" and start asking, ""Why me?"" [crickets chirping]
[The live-action audience looks bored. SpongeBob is shocked as Patrick is drooling.]
Sir Urchin: [whispers] That's not the line. Why did you stop hitting me?
Snail Fail: I want the audience to know that I am a real thespian and not just some [bowtie spins] bumbling buffoon.
[Sir Urchin and Snail Fail are now incredulous.]
Sir Urchin: Well, you wanna be a serious actor? Nobody's stopping you! Exit stage left!
Snail Fail: My pleasure! [throws bowtie on floor] I quit!
[The live-action audience gasps and murmurs. Snail Fail walks off the stage.]
Sir Urchin: Why, you!
[Cut to a ""Please Stand By"" sign. SpongeBob slides off the couch. Patrick starts laughing. SpongeBob stands up, then touches the TV screen.]
SpongeBob: It's no joke, Patrick. Our favorite comedy team just [splits himself apart] broke up on live TV!
[Patrick falls on the floor and cries. SpongeBob slides onto Patrick and wraps into a diaper. He gives him a bib and puts his finger in his thumb.]
SpongeBob: [sadly singing] ♪ Move your feet and grab your seat... ♪
SpongeBob and Patrick: ♪ It's ""The Sir Urchin and Snail Fail Show."" ♪
SpongeBob: [whimpers and turns back to normal] Patrick, as devoted fans, it's our duty to convince our two idols to get back together. The future of comedy depends on it.
Patrick: I'm in!
SpongeBob: We'll have to split up.
Patrick: Aw, I was just getting comfy. [sucks SpongeBob's thumb and the latter looks disappointed. Bubble transition to the next day. SpongeBob comes out of his garage, riding his unicycle. Patrick is nearby.]
SpongeBob: I'll go find Snail Fail, and you track down Sir Urchin. Good luck!
[They fist bump.]
SpongeBob: Booyah! [Patrick giggles]
[Their hands turn live-action, then their fingers wiggle as they giggle. SpongeBob salutes and rides backwards on his unicycle.]
SpongeBob: Whoo!
Patrick: [calling] Taxi!
[A taxi pulls up. Patrick jumps through the open window and briefly struggles to get his butt inside. He comes up in the back seat. Sir Urchin is driving, and Patrick doesn't know it's him.]
Sir Urchin: Where to, Mac?
Patrick: Take me to [points] Sir Urchin's house!
Sir Urchin: [surprised] Sir Urchin?
Patrick: [shows his Sir Urchin underwear] Yeah, Sir Urchin! You know, the guy that goes... [hits self with a hammer] ""Why, you!"" [laughs] He's so funny.
Sir Urchin: [replaces his cab driver hat with his top hat] Oh, you mean like [spins monocle and puts it on] this? Why, you! [poses as a fanfare plays. Close-up on Patrick's head. A live-action monkey toy claps its symbols.]
Sir Urchin: I'm Sir Urchin.
[Patrick's head explodes and blows the roof off the taxi. His head lands, he yells, and he moves into the front seat.]
Patrick: Sir Urchin? Why are you driving a taxi?
Sir Urchin: [polishes monocle, and sighs] My partner and I broke up five minutes ago, and since then, times have been tough.
[Patrick hits Sir Urchin with a mallet.]
Patrick: [grunts] You guys were so funny back then! [hits him] What I do? [hits him] What I do? [hits him] What I do? [laughs]
[Sir Urchin growls and reaches his hand out at Patrick, but then gets an idea.]
Sir Urchin: Say, Mac, how would you like to be... [holds out a headband with a tennis ball and an eyeball] ...Snail Fail the Second?
Patrick: [puts on the headband, and is now excited] Would I? [smashes Sir Urchin and laughs, then is unsure] Would I?]
[Bubble transition to Snail Fail checking his mail at his house.]
Snail Fail: Oh? [takes out yellow package] What is this? Huh. [brings it inside] Probably a gift from one of my adoring fans.
SpongeBob: [face appears on the package] Close. I am an adoring fan. [laughs]
[Snail Fail gasps]
SpongeBob: [springs back to his regular self] Doing! I'm sorry, Mr. Snail Fail. [takes out his bowtie] I just wanted to ask if you and Sir Urchin [puts bowtie on Snail Fail] could get back together again. [twists] You know, for your adoring fans.
Snail Fail: [takes off bowtie] No more low comedy for me. [rips it apart] The only way I shall ever step on a stage again is as a serious dramatic actor. Now, be gone! [tries to throw SpongeBob out of his house, but SpongeBob stretches up and Snail Fail kicks himself] Ah! [groans]
SpongeBob: [leans over Snail Fail] Ohh! I know a stage where people would love to see you act!
Snail Fail: Hmm. Really?
[Bubble transition to Shady Shoals Rest Home. Snail Fail re-enacts Macbeth in a theatrical outfit, with SpongeBob as a skull. A group of elderly people watch his performance.]
Snail Fail: Alas, poor Mackerel, I knew him, Halibut. A fellow of infinite jest. He hath borne me on his fishtail a thousand times. [gets hit by thrown dentures] Ow!
Audience: Boo! / You stink!
Snail Fail: Whoa! Ah!
[Snail Fail dodges a TV remote, a hot water bottle, and a padlock. He gets hit by an oxygen tank and crawls up to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Maybe we should call Sir Urchin.
Snail Fail: Never!
[An old lady approaches them on the stage, to their surprise.]
Old lady: [shaking fist] Why, you!
SpongeBob: [turns back to normal] Aah!
Old lady: What I do? Why, you! What I do? Why, you! What I do?
[SpongeBob and Snail Fail back off the stage and fall. SpongeBob is stuck in Snail Fail's shell. Bubble transition to Patrick hitting Sir Urchin with a mallet on a street downtown, with a small crowd watching them.]
Sir Urchin: Why, you!
Patrick: What me do?
[A kid whimpers and tears up as her mother covers her ears and takes her away. Patrick hits Sir Urchin again.]
Sir Urchin: Why, you!
Patrick: What me do? [hits Sir Urchin] How come nobody's laughing?
Sir Urchin: [stuck on Patrick's mallet] Well, you're saying, ""What me do?"" instead of, ""What I do?"" Maybe that's it.
Patrick: Good note. Got it. [takes Sir Urchin off the mallet and sits on him]
Sir Urchin: [stuck on Patrick's butt] Why, you!
Patrick: [imitating Snail Fail] Where I go?
Sir Urchin: [grunts] Nah, that's not it. [sits on the sidewalk] If only we had a real stage to perform on.
[A split screen shows Snail Fail and SpongeBob sitting next to each other on the street.]
Snail Fail: If only I had a real stage to act on.
[Two newspaper boys walk by, catching everyone's attention.]
Paperboys: Extry, extry! Big Bikini Bottom Talent Show tonight on a real stage!
[Snail Fail and Sir Urchin each take one of the papers.]
Sir Urchin and Snail Fail: [gasps] This might be the break we've been waiting for! [leave for the talent show, and SpongeBob and Patrick look excited.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay! [hold hands over the split screen] I smell a reunion!
[Bubble transition to a building with a ""Talent Show!"" sign.]
Announcer: [off-screen] Welcome to the Bikini Bottom Talent Show! Take it away, Bikini Bottom!
[The curtains part. A fancy-looking woman and a small blue narwhal are on the stage. The narwhal balances on the woman's finger, and she bites his nose and strums it with her other hand.]
Audience: Boo!
[The audience throws an axe, bowling ball, and watermelon at the woman. She cries and runs off-stage.]
SpongeBob: [peeks through curtains] Wow! Look at all those people! [laughs and sings as he bounces past the other contestants, then lands in front of Snail Fail]
Snail Fail: Excuse me. [bangs on Patrick's trash can shell] Is this the line for the talent show? [Patrick turns around, holding Sir Urchin] Agh! You!
Sir Urchin: You!
[SpongeBob and Patrick smash Sir Urchin and Snail Fail together.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Success!
Patrick: It's great to see you guys back together again!
[Snail Fail and Sir Urchin push each other away, sending SpongeBob and Patrick backwards.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa!
Snail Fail: I am not following [points to Sir Urchin] this riffraff onto the stage. [grabs SpongeBob] We shall go first.
Sir Urchin: Shove off, Fakespeare! Me and my new partner, Patrick, were here first! [Snail Fail takes his monocle] Hey!
[SpongeBob and Patrick lean in. Snail Fail throws the monocle on the ground, then stomps on it. SpongeBob, Patrick and Sir Urchin gasp]
Sir Urchin: That monocle was priceless!
Snail Fail: Now it's [pokes Sir Urchin's eyes] garbage.
Sir Urchin: [twists Snail Fail's eyes] Why, you!
Snail Fail: Agh! What did I do to deserve this fate?
[They get into a dust cloud fight. Sir Urchin picks up Snail Fail.]
Sir Urchin: Why you!
[He throws him onto the stage.]
Snail Fail: What have I done?
[Snail Fail smashes Sir Urchin with a crate.]
Sir Urchin: Why, you! [smashes Snail Fail with a soundspeaker]
Snail Fail: What is it? [smashes Sir Urchin with a drum]
Sir Urchin: [comes out of drum] Why, you! [smashes Sir Urchin with a piano.]
[The audience begins clapping and cheering. Sir Urchin smashes Snail Fail with an anvil. Snail Fail hits him back with a washtub.]
Sir Urchin: Why, you!
Snail Fail: Are you referring to me?
[Sir Urchin hits him with some of the other contestants. Snail Fail leaps back on-stage and fights him again. They fall off the stage. Snail Fail removes a tuba from his head and drops it on Sir Urchin.]
Sir Urchin: Why, you!
Snail Fail: Huh?
[They look at the audience and hear cheering.]
Snail Fail: What I do?
[The audience cheer. Sir Urchin and Snail Fail look at each other, hug, and start crying.]
Snail Fail: Our act was perfect the way it was. I should never have tried to change it.
Sir Urchin: Snail Fail, old buddy, go ahead. Add some serious acting to our show. I just want to get back together again!
Snail Fail: Oh, so do I!
Sir Urchin and Snail Fail: [hugging] Mmm!
Sir Urchin: [affectionately] Why, you.
Snail Fail: [affectionately] What I do.
Sir Urchin and Snail Fail: [hug again] Mmm!
[SpongeBob and Patrick watch from the stage. Patrick hits SpongeBob with his mallet.]
SpongeBob: [shaking fist, happily] Why, us!
Patrick: Look what we do'd! [hits SpongeBob]
Old lady: [chasing them away] Why, you! Why, you!
French Narrator: [narrating time card] One week later...
[At night, SpongeBob and Patrick are watching Sir Urchin and Snail Fail. The two are wearing fancy outfits, with Snail Fail holding a skull. Audience laughter is heard.]
Snail Fail: Alas, poor Mackerel, I knew him, Sir Urchin. A fellow of infinite jest, nautical nonsense be something he wished. Where be your jokes now, old friend? That I may laugh... [laughs] With merriment?
[The live-action audience is watching. SpongeBob and Patrick are shocked. After a pause, Snail Fail hits Sir Urchin with the skull.]
Sir Urchin: Why, you!
Snail Fail: What hath I done?
[The audience laughs. SpongeBob and Patrick snort their drinks at each other and laugh hysterically.]
SpongeBob: They're back and funnier than ever!
[Sir Urchin and Snail Fail bow as flowers are thrown at them.]
Sir Urchin: Thank you, everyone.
Snail Fail: We would just like to take a moment to give a shout-out, as the kids say, to our friends, SpongeBob and Patrick.
[Sir Urchin and Snail Fail lean out of the TV.]
Sir Urchin and Snail Fail: We couldn't have gotten back together without you guys!
[They hit SpongeBob and Patrick with mallets.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Why, you!
Sir Urchin and Snail Fail: What we do?
[The old lady continues shaking her fist at them.]
Old lady: Why, you! Why, you!
SpongeBob, Patrick, Sir Urchin, and Snail Fail: Not again! Aah!
[They all scream. A ""The End!"" card is shown with Sir Urchin and Snail Fail, similar to Looney Tunes. The episode ends.]",0.15,Doug Lawrence

Rather, she takes out a bag of barbecue nuts from home. SpongeBob is nervous because outside food is not allowed at the Krusty Krab, but once he tries one of the nuts, he likes it. Mr. Krabs finds out, and confiscates Sandy's food. However, he tries one of the nuts out of curiosity, and decides to hire Sandy at the Krusty Krab. Although she is hesitant at having a job, SpongeBob convinces her to stay and work with him.Sandy tells Mr. Krabs that she needs a barbecue grill, so he fashions one up out of stuff around the Krusty Krab. He puts the barbecue nuts as today's special. Squidward hands SpongeBob orders, which are all for Krabby Patties, and none for Sandy's nuts. SpongeBob advertises the nuts to Bubble Bass, who tastes one and tells everyone how good they are. SpongeBob and Sandy cook up plenty of nuts and Krabby Patties, but Sandy's dish proves more popular overall. Mr. Krabs renovates the restaurant into Kowboy Krab's Nut Shack and brings in more grills for Sandy. SpongeBob finds himself saddened by not having as much work to do, and is so overwhelmed by the smoke from the grills that he leaves the restaurant.Mr. Krabs goes to throw a bag of Krabby Patties away, and sees a despondent SpongeBob roasting a Krabby Patty over a trash fire. SpongeBob throws himself into the trash, and a worried Sandy asks if he is okay. Mr. Krabs calls her back in to cook more nuts. However, she throws them all into the garbage disposal, then leaves the restaurant, so that SpongeBob can get his job back. The customers riot and gang up on Mr. Krabs, until one takes a bite of a table and realizes that it has been flavored from the smoke. They eat the entire restaurant, and SpongeBob now finds an entire line of customers ready for Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs declares them to be double the price, but Sandy ties him up and forces him to make SpongeBob give the patties away for free.",Hot Crossed Nuts,"[The episode opens with a shot of the Krusty Krab. The scene then cuts to Sandy sitting, with a plate and a lunch bag on her table.]
Sandy: [ties on a bib] Uh-huh!
[SpongeBob stretches his leg and steps to Sandy. He is holding a closed platter.]
SpongeBob: Bonjour, mademoiselle San-day! I have brought your usual! [lifts up the platter to reveal a Krabby Patty, drink, and fries] One Krusty Combo!
Sandy: [takes drink] Thanks, SpongeBob, but I won't be needing the food! [reaches into bag] I brought a little something of my own from home!
[The words ""from home"" echo as SpongeBob's pupils shrink. Sandy takes out a bunch of roasted acorns and dumps them on a plate.]
Sandy: Sandy's smokin' barbecue nuts!
SpongeBob: [gasps and drops food] I see nothing! [pushes eyes into head and zips them up] There is no outside food allowed in the Krusty Krab!
Sandy: Come on, SpongeBob! [unzips her suit and grabs an acorn] I won't spill the nuts if you won't!
[She eats the acorn, then burps fire. Smoke clogs up her helmet, and is let out through a chimney.]
Sandy: Perfecto!
SpongeBob: [covering eyes and looking away] I haven't seen a thing!
Sandy: [holds out acorn] Try one!
[SpongeBob uncovers his eyes and looks at the acorn. He smiles and tries to grab it, but then looks around nervously. After a moment of hesitation, he eats the acorn. His eyes glow red and he spits out fire. Sandy ducks to avoid the flame.]
SpongeBob: Whooo! Now that's what I call Texas heat! [looks behind him] But we really should stop before Mr. Krabs finds out!
[Mr. Krabs is in the restaurant's crow's nest. He notices and his eyes go down to SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: [suspiciously] Finds out what?
SpongeBob: [screams, nervously] Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Krabs!
[SpongeBob pushes up against the table to block Krabs' view. He notices the acorns on the table and gasps. He jumps down, and his eyestalks are stretched out. He pulls them back together as Sandy looks out from behind SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: Outside food!?
SpongeBob: [kneeling and pleading] Oh, mercy, Mr. Krabs! She knows naught the error of her ways!
Sandy: Oh, please. I bet, one taste of these nuts and you'll whistle a different tune!
Mr. Krabs: [steals bag and acorns] That's enough! I'm confiscerating these unauthorized acorns!
[Mr. Krabs shuts himself in his office. His voice is faintly heard behind the door.]
Mr. Krabs: [behind door] Eh, what's so good about these unauthorized nuts anyway?
[Sandy is displeased, and SpongeBob is worried. A munching sound is heard, and fire blows out from Mr. Krabs' office door. Mr. Krabs comes out, his eyes red and smoke coming out of his mouth.]
Mr. Krabs: Alright! Sandy, you're hired!
Sandy: [confused] To do what?
[Mr. Krabs grabs Sandy and pushes her into the kitchen, and puts an employee hat on her head.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, to make those nuts at me restaurant, of course! They're delicerous!
Sandy: Uh, you're a few pickles shy of a Krabby Patty if you think I'm looking for a job.
SpongeBob: [grabs her arm] Sandy, this is no mere job! This is a calling! This is a duty to serve! This is... a dream come true!
Sandy: [smiles] Well, shoot! [shakes Mr. Krabs' hand] Why not?
[SpongeBob is still hanging on to Sandy's arm.]
Sandy: But I'll need me a barbecue grill!
Mr. Krabs: No problem! I've got an old navy trick for making barbecues! [grabs a grate from the smoke chute and a bowl of utensils, then fashions them into a barbecue] Ta-da!
[Mr. Krabs sets the barbecue down. Sandy kicks it, and it bounces and lands upright.]
Sandy: Not too shabby! I reckon she'll do!
Mr. Krabs: [leaving] Make sure to show her the ropes, boy-o!
SpongeBob: [giggling]
[Cut to a sign saying ""Daily Special BBQ Nuts"" taped to the Galley Grub.]
Squidward: Barbecue nuts? These customers will eat anything .
[Mr. Krabs steps off a stepladder and burps fire in Squidward's face, burning him.]
Mr. Krabs: Mmm! Nice aftertaste!
[Squidward, still charred, blinks once. Cut to SpongeBob and Sandy in the kitchen, where SpongeBob dances around.]
SpongeBob: [singing] Sandy's in the kitchen with SpongeBob, we're in the kitchen, we two! Sandy's in the kitchen with SpongeBob, making nuts on the barbeque!
Sandy: [laughs, then grabs his hand] You heard the boss man! Tell me what's what.
SpongeBob: Well, this here is where the magic happens: the grill. Heh.
[SpongeBob puts his hands on the grill, burning them. He screams in pain and then giggles. He dots out a red rectangle in front of him.]
SpongeBob: As long as the sacred space is respected, the kitchen will remain in perfect harmony.
Sandy: Not to worry! We'll be like two crickets on a fiddle in here.
Squidward: [rings bell and holds orders out] Here. Knock yourselves out. [SpongeBob takes the orders] Please.
[SpongeBob reads the orders. Sandy has already fired up her barbecue and is cooking three nuts with tongs.]
Sandy: Already on it! So how many nuts should I fix up?
SpongeBob: Nuts? Oh, sorry, Sandy, there must be a mistake. These are all for Krabby Patties.
Sandy: [ashamed] Ohhh.
SpongeBob: Don't worry! I'll get the word out!
[Bubble Bass walks up to the register. SpongeBob leans in from the order window with an acorn.]
SpongeBob: [cowboy accent] Howdy, Bubble Bass! [spins the acorn around] I'll reckon you're hankerin' for a delicious new dish!
Bubble Bass: Certainly not! I procure the same patty every day because I have a refined--
[SpongeBob throws the acorn into Bubble Bass's mouth. He swallows it and breathes fire on Squidward.]
Bubble Bass: Ooh! Such smoky sapidity! What is it?
SpongeBob: [cowboy accent] Sandy's smokin' barbecue nuts! Pretty good, am I right?
Bubble Bass: Not just ""pretty good,"" but good enough to go on the big screen!
[Bubble Bass shows a screen on top of his butt. Text scrolls by, beginning, ""TRY SANDY'S SMOKIN'..."" and text below it flashes ""AMAZING!!! 10/10"". Incidental 41 comes by and reads it]
Incidental 41: [reading] ""Try Sandy's smokin' barbecue nuts."" [calling out] Hear that, everyone? This guy's butt loves those nuts!
Incidental 23: [runs up to register and waves money] I'll take some nuts! His butt's never wrong!
Incidental 47: [gets in line] I want some!
Incidental 180: [gets in line] Me too!
Incidental 37A: [comes out of Incidental 180's pants] Ooh, nuts!
[Order papers flood into the Krusty Krab's kitchen through the window. Sandy takes out her tongs and SpongeBob slides up to the grill with his spatula.]
Sandy: Whooo, doggie! Now we're cookin'! Yeah!
[They clink their utensils and each begin cooking. SpongeBob flips patties into the air and watches them land. Sandy kicks her grill and watches the acorns land. SpongeBob squeezes ketchup onto some open buns. Sandy uses her tail to spray barbecue sauce on the acorns. SpongeBob rings the bell. He and Sandy present dishes to a bored-looking Squidward. Incidentals 106 and 110 are seen eating the acorns. They burp into each other's faces and then high five. A mother fish gives Incidental 102BABY an acorn to suck on, and he burps fire in her face. Sandy and SpongeBob dance around in circles. Sandy piles on loads of acorns at the order window and rings the bell multiple times, while SpongeBob only has one plate with a Krabby Patty. SpongeBob watches in surprise as Sandy dumps an entire bag of acorns onto her grill. Customers cheer as Bubble Bass swallows an entire plate of acorns. His eyes turn red and fire blows out of the Krusty Krab's chimney, burning Bikini Atoll. Cut back to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs comes into the kitchen, wearing a cowboy hat and pushing something under a tarp.]
Mr. Krabs: The demand for nuts is up! So we're increasing supply! [pulls off the tarp to reveal a bunch of barbecues, then places them around Sandy and SpongeBob] Make way, boy-o!
SpongeBob: Uh... Gee, Mr. Krabs, I think you might be overwhelming poor Sandy.
[Sandy takes out another pair of tongs, kicks a barbecue, and they all light on fire. Mr. Krabs unspools a long paper.]
Mr. Krabs: This here's the barbecue lunch rush! [reads tiny slip and hands it to SpongeBob] And, uh, here, somebody wants a Krabby Patty, I guess. [loudly] Now giddyup! [leaves kitchen]
[SpongeBob tries to reach over an ignited barbecue to reach the grill. A light comes on around Sandy. She uses her tongs to drum on all the barbecues. SpongeBob is trying to squirt ketchup on a Krabby Patty. He avoids acorns ricocheting around the room. Sandy has a cart full of plates of acorns.]
Sandy: Phew! All the orders are up!
SpongeBob: [holds out Krabby Patty] Yep. All of 'em.
Sandy: [takes it] Ooh! That one's mine.
[She uses the Krabby Patty to prop up a leg of a barbecue.]
Sandy: [adjusts barbecue] Perfect! No more wobble!
[SpongeBob looks sad, and his spatula droops.]
SpongeBob: [sadly] Patties...
[Bubble transition to the next day. Incidentals 41 and 115 walk into a newly Western-themed Krusty Krab. Incidental 107 is playing piano near the entrance.]
Incidental 41: Don't you love the new look?
Incidental 115: [frustrated] I'm just here for the nuts.
[Incidental 73's eyes are propelled upwards by fire, then go back into his head. Mr. Krabs hangs a new menu, which reads ""Kowboy Krab's Nut Shack"". The menu items are nuts for $5.00 and, in smaller font, Krabby Patties for $1.25.]
Squidward: ""Kowboy Krab's Nut Shack""? [scoffs] It's full of nuts, alright. Heh.
[Smoke comes out the order window, and it dissolves to show the kitchen full of barbecues, with Sandy cooking acorns on each. SpongeBob stands by the grill and coughs.]
Sandy: SpongeBob! Hand me them tongs over there, will ya? I'm busier than a six-legged horse in tap shoes!
[SpongeBob sees a lot of barbecues in his way to the tongs. He crawls under them and weakly grabs it. He brings them to Sandy.]
Sandy: Ooh! Thanks, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [eyes watering] Must... breathe... [sputtering]
[A fist-shaped smoke cloud punches him out through the back door. He inhales deeply. The smoke fist waves goodbye. SpongeBob tries to open the door, but is unable to.]
SpongeBob: [sadly] Ohhh!
[Sandy continues cooking. Mr. Krabs comes in with two full bags.]
Mr. Krabs: Thar's gold in them there nuts!
Sandy: What's in the bags, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [raises one bag] Oh, this here's the next round of barbecue nut orders!
Sandy: [wipes helmet] Ooh! Well, scratch my back and call me a cactus! [points] And what about that one?
Mr. Krabs: [raises other bag] Oh, this one? This one's full of useless Krabby Patties. Nobody really wants 'em, so they're garbage.
[Mr. Krabs exits to find SpongeBob sitting on crates and roasting empty Krabby Patty buns over a burning trash can. Sandy looks in, concerned.]
Sandy: Oh, my! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [weakly; a foghorn is heard in the background] Hi, Sandy. Just toasting my buns. [small laugh]
Mr. Krabs: Move over, lad! You're blocking me trash!
[He throws the bag into the trash can. A Krabby Patty spills out. SpongeBob gasps. Mr. Krabs dusts his claws and heads back into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Money, money, money, money, nuts, nuts, nuts!
[SpongeBob stands inside the trash can and lowers himself in.]
Sandy: [concerned] Uh, SpongeBob? Are you gonna be okay?
[SpongeBob mutters sadly from inside the trash. Krabs calls out to Sandy.]
Mr. Krabs: Back to work! That money won't barbecue itself!
[Sandy looks frustrated. Bubble transition. In his office, Mr. Krabs is surrounded by smoking piles of money.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, I love the smell of money! [sniffs] A little smokier than usual. [smells] Oh, yeah...
[Customers are heard complaining outside. Mr. Krabs exits.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward! What's the hold-up?
Squidward: Why don't you ask [points] your pit master? She stopped barbecuing nuts.
Mr. Krabs: She what ?
[Sandy dumps acorns into a garbage disposal. Mr. Krabs runs in to see the barbecues all piled up and overturned. Sandy is surprised at his entrance.]
Mr. Krabs: Land dweller! What's the meaning of this?
Sandy: [staged] Ohhhh! I'm plumb out of nuts!
Mr. Krabs: You're plumb out of what !?
Sandy: [lowers his hat] Sorry, Kowboy Krabs. Looks like you have to find another way to make your dough!
[Mr. Krabs' hat lights on fire. Sandy puts her employee hat on Squidward and exits the restaurant.]
Sandy: So long, folks! The nut tree's done run dry!
[The customers get angry and gang up on Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: [sheepishly] Uh, howdy, y'all!
Incidental 185: I don't reckon we can get no Sandy's smokin' barbecue nuts without no Sandy, can we?
Mr. Krabs: Ummm... no.
Incidental 185: Riot!
[The customers raise their fists and riot. Incidental 185 rips up a table and throws it, which hits Squidward, who is heard shouting. A group of customers, including Bubble Bass, rip the menu off. Incidental 41 bites into a table, chews it, and realizes something.]
Incidental 41: Huh? [calling out] Hey, everybody! This table's got that smoky Texas tang!
Bubble Bass: [rips up floorboard, eats it, and burps fire] Fascinating! The smoke from Sandy's nuts has flavored everything in this restaurant!
Incidental 185: [ringing bell] Chow time!
[Customers run around the restaurant and eat everything.]
Mr. Krabs: No! Stop it! No! Me restaurant! No!
[The customers devour the entire restaurant, leaving only SpongeBob and the dumpster behind. The smell of the cooking Krabby Patty catches the customers' attention.]
Incidental 41: Say, that smells delicious!
SpongeBob: Oh, this? Oh, it's just a useless old Krabby Patty.
Bubble Bass: A snack without splinters? How novel! Perhaps we could partake in your patties?
[A line forms behind SpongeBob.]
Customers: Oh, hey, I want some of those!
[SpongeBob cheers up, and grabs his spatula and some patties. He flips a lid over the trash can and grills patties on it.]
SpongeBob: Orders up!
Mr. Krabs: [throws away cowboy hat] Good news! Trashy Patties are now double the price!
Customers: [complaining] Aww, come on!
[Sandy lassos Mr. Krabs.]
Sandy: Not so fast! I reckon these patties are on the house! [winks] Right, SpongeBob?
[SpongeBob and the customers cheer ""Yee-haw!""]
Mr. Krabs: I guess we all went a little nuts today. [burps fire] Ah, still a nice aftertaste!

Everyone's got high hopes and are excited to enjoy themselves there, but it leads to musical disaster, as the octopus's abysmal talent leads to destruction and terror throughout the fields. Squidward is kicked out by an angry mob, and finds himself heading to the streets of Bikini Bottom, where he attempts to prove his musical talent to the public once more - which creates more mass damage, even to the point where buildings collapse. When planning to continue his routine ""one more time,"" he's interrogated by the music police, getting his clarinet evicted and forced to take mandatory music education at Little Flipper Music Academy.Squidward finds himself degraded in music class, and his attempts to act rebellious (sitting at the back of the class so no one can see him) or a superior (introducing himself as a musical genius) are futile, being foiled and made fun of. Shortly after this, a new student pops up in class, and it turns out to be SpongeBob himself, only making Squidward more miserable. All of the students are then asked by their teacher to play their instrument so she can indicate their skill level. Most of the students prove to be equally awful, except SpongeBob, as his ""flute-nose"" technique proves to be the most superior of all of them, even getting the other students excited enough to follow him around. Squidward then has to play his clarinet, belted to a stroller following its eviction. His talents are worse than ever, audibly torturing all of the students. Meanwhile, SpongeBob once again performs his ""flute-note"" music to the class, and all of the other students join him and form a mini-band. Squidward tries to join in with their tune, being given lots of different instruments, but ends up being progressively worse and worse at each of them. After trying to a play a broom that starts a fire (subsequently getting extinguished), Squidward's arrogance and stubborn attitude leads him take back his clarinet, creating a musical tornado that throws almost everyone out of the school. The music cops soon surround the department, and demand Squidward to stop playing, to which he refuses.In response, the cops call in a robot maestro, which shoots a cork into Squidward's clarinet, putting an end to his turbulent tornado. Squid's put under musical arrest, and his clarinet's shredded to nothing but wood. He sobs to himself, thinking that he'll never play music again. While trying to comfort Squidward, SpongeBob gives him a tissue that when sneezed out, creates trumpet-esque noises. It turns out that Squidward finally found out his musical talent, with his music being loved by everyone. The school's teacher declares Squidward as the most improved student in the class. Squidward is then performing to various Bikini Bottomites at the park and everyone cheers on for him, and an iris zooms in and cuts Squidward's nose off, emitting an ""Ow"" as the episode ends.",Mandatory Music,"[The episode opens with a shot of the sun. Jellyfish swim by, and it's a sunny day at a public park. Squidward is standing in a gazebo.]
Squidward: Attention, everyone! Gather around for a free concert of beautiful music.
Incidental 6: Oh, a free concert!
Man #1: Fantastic!
Man #2: Yaaay!
[Everyone gathers to watch Squidward.]
Squidward: And a one, and a two!
[Squidward starts playing his clarinet, and it sounds awful. Crooked red music notes come out. Cut to a woman fish and a football player covering their ears.]
Incidental 8: Ugh! Get me out of here, Chad!
[The football player takes Incidental 8 and inflates himself with his thumb, then floats upwards.]
Lady Upturn: My ears are offended ! [wraps her worm around her head, covers her ears, and walks off]
[Another man screams as he is kicked by music notes. More people run by, screaming. Finally, they grab Squidward and stop his music.]
Squidward: [worried] Hey, hey, what's going on? Put me down! Let go of my legs! My clarinet!
[They throw Squidward into a stop sign. Music notes land next to him. His clarinet hits him in the head. He grabs it and shakes it angrily.]
Squidward: Philistines!
[Bubble transition to Squidward continuing to play downtown. He passes a mother with her baby, and the baby starts crying. The mother pauses and then begins crying. Squidward plays past some alley snails, who hiss and attack each other. He passes a gym, where Larry is inside lifting a weight. Larry drops his weight when he hears Squidward's music. Buildings melt and flower clouds wilt. Buildings begin collapsing. Squidward remains playing, his eyes closed.]
Squidward: One more time!
[He takes a deep breath and is about to play, but a cop reaches his hand out of a mailbox and sticks it in his mouth.]
Male cop: Freeze, mister!
Female cop: [comes out of fire hydrant] Put the clarinet down nice and slow!
Squidward: [condescending] Who are you supposed to be? The music police?
Male cop: That's right, fella!
[They unzip their costumes to reveal a badge with a music symbol, a tuning fork, and band hats.]
Male cop: And you are in violation of section 4 of the symphony code! [takes out sheet music with ""VIOLATION"" stamped on it] Reckless playing of a reed instrument!
Female cop: Your clarinet is officially out of commission! [sticks a cork and lock in it]
Squidward: What the--!? [tries to play it, but no sound comes out] Hey!
Male cop: [writes and hands him a ticket] If you want that boot off your clarinet, you'll have to undergo mandatory music re-education!
Squidward: [reads ticket] Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[Bubble transition to the police car arriving outside of Little Flipper Music Academy.]
Squidward: [reading] ""Little Flipper Music Academy""? Oh, no! I am not going to any school for minnows!
[He is about to step away, but the cops forcibly drag him in. His tentacles snap off the door and he flies into a seat.]
Squidward: Hey! You can't de-grade me like this!
Male cop: Yeah, that's what they all say. [his radio goes off]
Radio policeman: [buzzes] Calling car 38. A drummer missed a beat at the jazz club on Bebop Way.
Male cop: Let's rock and roll!
[The two cops take out guitars and run away. Squidward looks around and sees that he is sitting in the front of the class.]
Squidward: I wouldn't be caught dead sitting in front of this class! [moves his seat to the back row, then smugly] They won't see me back here. [laughs]
Mrs. Sturgeon: [entering] Good morning, class! Would everyone please turn their chairs around?
Class: Yes, Mrs. Sturgeon! [moves their chairs to face Squidward]
Squidward: Huh? What? Oh, for Neptune's sake!
Mrs. Sturgeon: It looks like we have a new student sitting right up front today! Will you stand and introduce yourself to the class?
Squidward: [sighs, stands up, and clears throat] My name is Squidward Tentacles and I've been playing clarinet longer than you've all been alive.
Mrs. Sturgeon: [politely] And why are you here, Mr. Tentacles?
Squidward: [slightly ashamed] ...because of a court order.
Fergus: [leaning forward] Court order!?
Otto: [sing-song] Squidward got a court order!
Class: [sing-song] Squidward got a court order! [they throw crumpled music sheets at Squidward]
Squidward: Ow! Hey! Stop it!
Mrs. Sturgeon: Now, settle down, class!
[SpongeBob's laughter is heard.]
Mrs. Sturgeon: Oh, yes! We have one more new student joining us today!
SpongeBob: [enters] Hello! I'm SpongeBob SquarePants, and I'm really looking forward to-- [sees Squidward] ooh, Squidward! I didn't know you were taking this class too!
[Squidward bangs his head on his desk and sits down.]
SpongeBob: [sits next to him] Isn't this wonderful? We're musical classmates!
Squidward: Kill me now.
[Transition to Mrs. Sturgeon addressing the class.]
Mrs. Sturgeon: To begin, I would like each of you to play your instrument to gauge everyone's skill levels. [sits at a piano] We'll go around the classroom one by one. Fergus, would you start us off?
[Fergus strums his guitar, but gets his hand caught in it, and the strings wrap around his body.]
Mrs. Sturgeon: Good effort, Fergus! Nelly?
[Nelly is seated at a drum set. She slams her head against the drums, gets dizzy, and collapses.]
Mrs. Sturgeon: ...Interesting technique. Otto, would you play a little on your keytar?
Otto: [plays keytar but grips it too hard and breaks it] Oh! [sadly] Hmm...
Mrs. Sturgeon: Hmm... Definitely room for improvement. [weak laugh] Student SquarePants, would you give us a taste of your musical talents?
SpongeBob: Soitenly!
[SpongeBob jumps out of his chair and plays the nose flute in front of the class. He puts on a Pied Piper hat and dances around the classroom. The other classmates get up and dance with him. Squidward's eye twitches and he growls. SpongeBob takes a standing ovation in front of class, and the kids clap. Squidward is chewing on a piece of paper in anger, but forces a smile when SpongeBob takes his seat.]
Mrs. Sturgeon: [clapping] Excellent nose flute technique, Mr. SquarePants! Now it's time for Mr. Tentacles to demonstrate his musical abilities!
[She wheels in his clarinet, which still has the boot on it. She struggles to unlock it.]
Squidward: [to SpongeBob, smugly] Now, let me show you how it's really done! [squeezes out bottom of chair]
SpongeBob: Woooo! Go, Squidward!
Squidward: [with clarinet] Brace yourselves, for you are about to witness a stroke of pure genius! [plays badly]
[The students stare in horror. A kid with a beanie flicks his and flies through the ceiling. Fergus's hair stands on end. A girl puts a tuba over her head. Mrs. Sturgeon takes the clarinet away.]
Mrs. Sturgeon: [laughs] It did sound like you had some kind of stroke. [locks clarinet back up] The clarinet might be too advanced for your level, Mr. Tentacles. Perhaps you should try a different instrument? [gives him a harmonica]
[Squidward plays the harmonica, but it's so shrill that Mrs. Sturgeon quickly takes it back and shakes her head. SpongeBob continues playing his nose flute. Fergus joins on his guitar. Squidward tries to play the pan flute, but blows fire out and it explodes, covering his face in ash.]
Squidward: Ow.
[SpongeBob and Fergus continue playing and are joined by Otto. Mrs. Sturgeon gives Squidward a kazoo, which he blows through too hard and gets his head caught in. Nelly comes in with a drum set and plays along. Mrs. Sturgeon holds a broom.]
Mrs. Sturgeon: Uh, maybe you should just work on your fingering. [gives him the broom]
[Squidward, in disbelief, tries grasping onto the broom in different places. He picks it up and blows into it, but no sound comes out. SpongeBob, Fergus, Otto, and Nelly continue playing, with two colored geysers coming up next to them. Squidward strains harder, lighting the broom on fire. Mrs. Sturgeon blasts him with a fire extinguisher, pinning him against the wall.]
Squidward: That's it! I've had enough of this nonsense!
[He gets to his clarinet and rips the boot off with his teeth. He plays it, blowing a tornado of music and sour notes that picks up the room's chairs and students. Mrs. Sturgeon struggles against it.]
Mrs. Sturgeon: Must... pull... music... alarm! [pulls alarm]
[Squidward's music tornado picks up everyone else and pushes them out the door. The music police pull up again.]
Male cop: [through megaphone] Squidward Tentacles, put down the clarinet before someone's eardrums get hurt!
Squidward: [opens door and waves clarinet] Come and take it, copper!
[Squidward keeps playing, and the tornado bursts through the ceiling of the Music Academy, with him floating in it.]
Female cop: He's getting too powerful! What do we do now?
Male cop: Send in... [dramatic close-up on face] the Maestro.
[The truck opens up to show a robot with two eyes and a conductor's wig. Grand, orchestral classical music plays. The robot shoots corks at Squidward. He dodges them, but one lands in his clarinet.]
Squidward: Huh? [falls]
Male cop: Fun's over, Bad-thoven!
Squidward: Hm?
Male cop: Up top! [high-fives female cop, then puts music note-shaped handcuffs on Squidward]
Female cop: [throws clarinet in woodchipper] You won't be hurting anyone with this anymore! [picks up chip] Your villainous vibrato days... [snaps chip] are over!
Squidward: [sad sniffling] I'll never play music again!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward! You can take up a new hobby! Like... lint sorting! Or... competitive thumb twiddling! Or...
Squidward: I don't have any thumbs! [cries]
SpongeBob: Awww. [offers him handkerchief] Go ahead and give it a big blow, buddy.
[Squidward takes it and blows his nose, creating a loud trumpet sound. Mrs. Sturgeon overhears.]
Mrs. Sturgeon: [amazed] That sound!
[Squidward continues playing a trumpet tune with his nose.]
Male cop: [takes off sunglasses, showing his teary eyes] Positively angelic!
SpongeBob: [eyes look like music notes, he snaps out of it] Keep going, Squidward! You finally found your instrument! It was right in front of your nose all along! In fact, it was your nose!
[Squidward blows his nose, creating a loud trumpet noise and spraying ink everywhere. The students and Mrs. Sturgeon are covered in ink, but they smile.]
Squidward: [laughs] Excuse me.
Mrs. Sturgeon: I think we can all agree, Mr. Tentacles is the most improved student in the class!
[The class cheers. Squidward smiles. Bubble transition to Squidward performing another concert, this time with his nose playing. Everyone from his first concert, his classmates, and Mrs. Sturgeon are cheering him on.]
Man: Encore! Encore!
[Squidward blows his nose. Everyone takes out their umbrellas to shield themselves from the ink.]
SpongeBob: Wooo, way to go, Squidward! Encore! Encore!
[Squidward wipes a tear from his eye and then happily continues playing. The screen irises and cuts off his nose, ending the episode.]

Patrick does not have a bike, but Gary manages to find a spare one in SpongeBob's garage. Patrick tries to ride the bike, but he does not know how to, so SpongeBob agrees to teach him. He uses various methods to help Patrick get on the bike, but Patrick continuously struggles to do so.SpongeBob balances Patrick's brain, and he is able to get on the bike afterwards. SpongeBob helps Patrick pedal, but his hands remain on the bike while he is away from Patrick, resulting in Patrick crashing into SpongeBob's garage. SpongeBob then tries to help Patrick focus by riding ahead of him with a Krabby Patty, but Patrick ends up falling after he eats it.SpongeBob and Patrick are soon shown on a tandem bicycle, with SpongeBob showing Patrick how to pedal. SpongeBob asks Patrick if he can pedal faster, but Patrick pedals so fast that the two ride out of control and crash into Mrs. Puff and Mr. Krabs, as well as Squidward. SpongeBob asks Mrs. Puff for advice on teaching Patrick, but Mrs. Puff tells SpongeBob that some students are unteachable, which unintentionally gives SpongeBob the idea to ""unteach"" Patrick by clearing his brain.SpongeBob clears Patrick's brain of several aspects of his knowledge — such as brushing his teeth, watching TV, putting on his pants, and his family — to make room for bike riding. SpongeBob prepares a bike-riding memory for Patrick. When Patrick is about to ride the bike, SpongeBob tells him to have fun, but this clashes with the bike-riding memory, resulting in Patrick forgetting how to ride a bike. Patrick slides away and ends up riding down Dead Man's Hill, managing to make it to the bottom. Patrick is then shown in several instances of riding throughout Bikini Bottom, helping people in the process. Patrick's favors result in him receiving Ms. Mayor's key to the town.Patrick is later shown in the hospital, where it is revealed that he crashed on Dead Man's Hill and ended up in a six-week coma meaning all the instances were dreams.

Patrick: You bet your square pants I do! [gets on an invisible bike and bicycles around his house] Oh, I love bike riding. [giggles, then stops and falls down] I forgot I don't have a bike.
SpongeBob: No problem, I have a spare.
[Cut to SpongeBob opening up his garage to reveal all of his junk.]
SpongeBob: Hmm. [a basketball bounces out] Uh oh. Hold on, it'll just take me a minute to find it. Hoo! [dives into the junk pile, tosses out multiple items] Sorry, Patrick, I just can't seem to--
[SpongeBob is interrupted by Gary riding a bike.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: --find it.

Patrick: Check out this sweet ride!
SpongeBob: [taking off Gary's helmet, patting him] Thanks, Gare-bear.
Gary: [slithering away] Meow.

Patrick: Come on, SpongeBob, follow me! [rides the bike, and instantly bumps into SpongeBob, sending him backwards into the sand] Oh yeah, I don't know how to ride a bike. [comes back sobbing, SpongeBob holds an umbrella to block tears] I guess I can't go bike riding with you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, don't you worry your [taps Patrick's head] pretty pink pointy head. [closes umbrella, tossing it] I can teach you how to be an expert bicyclist.
Patrick: Oh, nice! I'm gonna be an icicle mist!
SpongeBob: Lesson one, how to properly sit on a bike. [pulling head forwards] Face forward, [tilts to his side with arms parallel] arms parallel but loose, [places long feet on ground] both feet placed firmly on the sand.

Patrick: [floating above] I don't know what you're talking about.
SpongeBob: [tying balloons to Patrick] Uh-huh. Those should keep you upright. [balloons fly up and rip Patrick's shorts off, and Patrick falls onto him] Maybe some training wheels. [cut to him putting training wheels on Patrick's bike]
Patrick: [laughing, getting on bike]
SpongeBob: [makes ""ok"" hand gesture] That'll make you a bit more stable.
Patrick: Pfft, that's what my psychiatrist says. [falls over, SpongeBob moves out of the way]

Patrick: [in between several wheels] Ow! [slumps on ground]
SpongeBob: Hmm. Time to check under the hood. [opens Patrick's head to see a dancing brain, which lands in his hand] Just as I thought. Your brain's a bit unbalanced. [places brain back into Patrick's head with a baby walker]
Patrick's brain: Ooh, ooh. [cheering] Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: [closes Patrick's head and puts his helmet back on] Now give it a try.
Patrick: [successfully gets on bike and cheers]

SpongeBob: Don't worry, buddy. I won't take my hands off this bike. I promise.

SpongeBob: For now, just observe me. Take a closer look and see how it's done. [struggles to pedal forward, Patrick giggles, then successfully pedals forward] Watch my feet and [points to feet] do what I do.
Patrick: [looking at SpongeBob's feet pedal] Ooh. [pedals himself, giggling]
SpongeBob: That's it, now you're gettin' it. Now pedal just a little bit faster.
Patrick: Uh, faster? [pedals way faster, making them both scream]
SpongeBob: Oh, a little too fast there, Patrick! Just relax.
Patrick: [yelling] I'm relaxed! [screaming, bike quickly pedals forward]

SpongeBob: Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: What?
SpongeBob: [pointing, shouting] Squidward!
Squidward: [pedaling on lounge bike] La-da-dee, la-da-dum-- [screams as the bike crashes into his] [groaning as his bike has merged with the others, sighs] Of course.
Mrs. Puff: [trying to maintain balance] No!
Mr. Krabs: Whoa!

Patrick: [screams]
Mrs. Puff: [groans]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Hello, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: You know, I'm having a little trouble trying to teach Patrick how to ride a bicycle. Have you ever had trouble teaching a student, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: [groans] Some people are just unteachable.

SpongeBob: You know what your problem is, Patrick? [poking at Patrick's head] Your brain is just too full of unimportant knowledge.
Patrick: Yeah, it is pretty jam-packed. Or, is it packed with jam? [gets out a piece of toast and uses his head to squirt jam onto it, and eats it]
SpongeBob: We need to make some room in your head for bike riding. Let's see... [snaps fingers] Do you remember how to brush your teeth?
Patrick: Of course! [holds comb] I even know how to comb my teeth. [combs his front tooth, scraping it]
[SpongeBob pulls on Patrick's tongue, and his eyes turn into an image of a toothbrush and toothpaste. SpongeBob uses an eraser in Patrick's head to erase the images, and therefore his memories of how to brush his teeth.]
SpongeBob: Well, now you don't.
Patrick: Whoo-hoo!
[SpongeBob grabs Patrick's tongue again, and his display turns into an image of him watching TV.]
SpongeBob: How to watch TV? [erases memory] Nah, not important. [pulls Patrick's tongue again, displaying Patrick in a realistic pair of pants] Put on your pants? [erases memory] Overrated. [pulls Patrick's tongue again, displaying his family from The Patrick Star Show ] Family? [erases memory] Eh, unnecessary.

Patrick: Who... is... I?

Patrick: [pedaling down past a sign that says ""DEAD MAN'S HILL""] Don't worry, SpongeBob. It's just Bread Man's Hill. [crow on top of sign caws]

[The scene changes to Patrick's first person view, where he begins opening his eyes to SpongeBob looking at him.]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Patrick is shown to be in a full-body cast at the hospital] Oh, thank Neptune you're okay.
Patrick: Of course I'm okay. I'm an expert bicyclist now.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you crashed all the way down Dead Man's Hill.
Patrick: Hmm...
[Cutaway to what really happened, which was that Patrick crashed all the way down the hill.]
SpongeBob: You've been in a coma for six weeks!
Patrick: [eyes turn to stars] Oh! A new personal best.
SpongeBob: Sorry I couldn't teach you how to ride a bike, Patrick.
Patrick: Who needs a dumb bike? [hops out of bed to reveal he is now a bike] I am a bike! Hop on, buddy! Let's roll! [SpongeBob hops onto him and rides out of the hospital, both laughing] Whee!
[The duo ride past the doctor, Squidward, who is on crutches, knocking him over, getting his casted leg caught on the door. They then ride past the octopus family and their nurse.]
SpongeBob: Look out! [the octopus children cheer, while the mother is furious]

Patrick: I know exactly what I'm gonna eat today! [strolls in and gets to the register, looks around] Wait, why did I come in here, again?
Squidward: Lemme guess--
Patrick: [grabs Squidward's mouth] Don't tell me! Hmm, starts with a K. Uhh-- [head deflates and sparks, then lights on fire]
Squidward: [sighs and reads his magazine]
[Plankton is disguised on Patrick's back. He jumps off and hops the grill.]
SpongeBob: [singing and juggling ingredients] ♪ Throwin' patties on the grill! Juggling ingredients, trying not to spill! ♪
Plankton: [gets lit on fire] Ow, ow, ow, ow!
SpongeBob: [singing] ♪ The grill aflame! Work is a game! When I'm done, you'll have a bun! Full of yum, yum, yum ♪
[Plankton unzips his disguise and sees a Krabby Patty.]
Plankton: Huh? Yes! My plan is working perfectly. [rubs his butt, which is burnt] Minus the third degree burns. [SpongeBob's shadow comes by, singing] Ooh! [hides behind the patty and jumps away with it] And now, for my clever escape!
SpongeBob: Hey! [grabs patty] Where do you think you're going? Trying to sneak out before the big delivery, huh? [wraps it] No need to get cold feet, little patty. [puts it in a bag] You'll be very happy in your new home. [checks watch] Oh, no! I'm gonna be late for my delivery!
[SpongeBob runs outside and hops in a plane, then flies it away. Transition to him riding a seahorse. Transition to him in a hot air balloon. Transition to him skiing.]

[A rocket lands. SpongeBob steps out and goes to a building right next to the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: [humming] Don't worry, little patty, you're almost home.
[He knocks on the door, but a gust of wind blows the bag away. He is carried through the air.]
SpongeBob: Huh? Ohh! Wait! Whoa! Ohh! Whoa!
[On a map, SpongeBob zigzags around. He bounces through the Bermuda Triangle, its sides lighting up with pinball sound effects. He lands on a skull-shaped island, shouts, and lands on the patty.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! Hey, something soft broke my fall. [takes out patty] Thanks, patty.
Plankton: [groans, trapped in wrapper]
[SpongeBob hears various animal noises.]
SpongeBob: Patty, I don't think we're in Bikini Bottom anymore. [bird screeches, shot of Monster Island] We must be lost in the deep Goo Sea. I guess we'll miss the delivery. [tearing up] I've let down poor, old Mr. Krabs! [patty runs away, he points at it] Hey, where are you going?
Plankton: I'm just going to the, uh... little patty's room?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, why didn't you say so? I'll discreetly turn around and give you a little privacy. [turns around giggles, patty runs away] Hey, wait a minute. I don't make little patties. [grabs patty] Nice try, Plankton.
[He tears off the wrapper to see Plankton on the patty.]
Plankton: [chuckles, runs off with the patty]
SpongeBob: Get back here!
[SpongeBob and Plankton each struggle and fight for the patty. After spinning around and ending up in different positions, SpongeBob has Plankton pinned to the ground.]
SpongeBob: Wait a minute, we're marooned! We have to make this patty last. It's our only food until we're rescued.
Plankton: [straining to escape, then gives up] So? What's your point?
SpongeBob: If we're gonna survive, we'll have to share.
Plankton: Huh, share? [stands up and extends hand] You've got yourself a deal, big boy!
SpongeBob: Aww, put 'er there, pal. [shakes Plankton's hand and holds out the patty] Here, you can have the first bite. Make it a small one.
Plankton: Don't mind if I do!
[A purple snake monster comes out of the sand and eats the patty. Plankton bites its skin.]
Plankton: [munches] That's strange. [munches]
SpongeBob: Uh, Plankton?
Plankton: [munches] This patty tastes a little... angry.
SpongeBob: Plankton...?
[Plankton stops chewing and notices the snake hissing at him.]
Plankton: Whaa!
[The snake grabs him with its tongue and eats him, then begins to burrow back into the sand. SpongeBob grabs its tail. He pulls the snake back through the sand, and it lands on the ground. Plankton slides out of its mouth, covered in saliva.]
SpongeBob: Plankton! You're okay! Oh, I thought I lost you!
[The snake gets angry and shakes its tail.]
Plankton: Uhh, SpongeBob?
Snake: [roars]
SpongeBob and Plankton: [running away from the snake] Whoa! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
[The snake's body wraps around itself. Its head gets pulled back and hit against a coil, wrapped around trees. SpongeBob continues running in circles and screaming while Plankton is exhausted.]
SpongeBob: [screaming]
Plankton: Enough!
SpongeBob: [stops, looks at ground] Sorry.
Plankton: [breathes deeply] We have to start looking for shelter before it gets dark.
SpongeBob: What about Mr. Snake Monster? [points to the twisted-up snake] Can he come stay with us?
Plankton: No.
SpongeBob: [to snake] Sorry. I tried.
[The snake monster looks sad and groans.]
[Bubble transition to Plankton fastening his own tent out of kelp.]
Plankton: [grunts] Not too shabby. [walks inside] Yep.
[Zoom out to show SpongeBob looking at the tent, which is too small for him.]
SpongeBob: [crawls in] Plankton, could you move your leg over a little? It's a bit cramped in here.
[The tent explodes and both are sent out, screaming. They crash. SpongeBob is impaled on some thorns.]
SpongeBob: Hey, lucky these thorns broke our fall.
Plankton: [with his eye impaled on a thorn] Yeah, lucky me.
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Plankton walking into a cave.]
SpongeBob: Hey, this place looks pretty spacious. We can really do a lot with this place. Over there can be your room. [only their eyes are visible in the darkness] That could be my room. Oh, it's a little dark back here, isn't it? Hey, I can hear my echo. [voice echoing]
Plankton: Does it feel a little wet in here to you?
SpongeBob: Hey, look! I found a light switch! [pulls a monster's tongue, revealing they are in its mouth]
Snail monster: [roars]
[SpongeBob and Plankton run out of the cave, screaming. A snail monster bites at them. SpongeBob takes shelter behind a rock. Plankton comes up, carrying the top half of his body, which has been torn off.]
SpongeBob: [waves] Oh, hey, Plankton.
Plankton: [holding head] New plan. Let's grab a bite to eat.
SpongeBob: [walks through forest and points up] Ooh, look! Bananers! Hmm. [takes off his arm] Gah. [throws it at the bananas] Wha! [his arm boomerangs back, holding a banana]
Plankton: Finally, some grub!
SpongeBob: Let's eat!
[SpongeBob unpeels the banana to show a face on the inside.]
Banana baby: Mama!
SpongeBob and Plankton: Aww!
[A banana monster is leaning over them.]
Banana monster: [roars]
[SpongeBob laughs nervously and gives the baby back to its mother. It puts it in its pouch and grabs SpongeBob, then peels him like a banana. Transition to SpongeBob and Plankton being sucked on by giant fruit flies.]
Fruit flies: [burp and fly away]
SpongeBob: [stomach grumbles, points to rock] Should we eat this rock?
Plankton: I'll eat anything.
[SpongeBob sprinkles salt on the rock and takes out a fork and knife. He pokes the rock and it turns out to be on a giant blue monster's back.]
Giant blue monster: [roars]
[SpongeBob and Plankton scream. SpongeBob grabs a vine and swings away, then crashes into a tree. The monster bites at SpongeBob a few times, who screams when it does. A coconut falls on SpongeBob's head.]
SpongeBob: [throws coconut] Leave us alone!
[The monster gets the coconut and chews it thoroughly.]
Giant blue monster: [happily] Hey!
SpongeBob and Plankton: [look at the monster, then each other, and smile] Aha!
[Cut to SpongeBob placing down an ""Open"" sign. He and Plankton staff a new restaurant, The Coco-Hut. Monsters line up, and SpongeBob leans to see the line behind them. He and Plankton wink and give thumbs-ups. SpongeBob cuts a coconut with a knife. He dumps the filling out and throws globs of it onto a stove. He squishes one into a patty shape and assembles a coconut dish.]
SpongeBob: [laughs]
[SpongeBob puts the dish on a plate and rings a bell. A squid's tentacle grabs it. A giant squid is manning the register boat, and accepts a variety of miscellaneous items as payment. It hands the food to the customer. Pan to show various monsters eating. Plankton jumps onto a table with two coconut dishes, to the seated monsters' excitement.]
SpongeBob: Yeah! [he and Plankton give thumbs ups]
[Coconuts fall down the screen and transition to SpongeBob and Plankton holding towels and walking to their lockers.]
SpongeBob: Great work out there today. [opens locker, throws towel in, sees a picture of Gary, and touches it] Ohh, it's just not the same without you.
[Plankton opens his locker and touches a picture of the secret formula bottle.]
Plankton: [sighs] It's just not the same without you. [closes locker] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Plankton?
Plankton: Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
SpongeBob: Yep, I can't decide either. [takes out shirts] Do the company sports jerseys look better in beige or green?
Plankton: [jumps on SpongeBob's nose] No, you imbecile. It's time for us to am-scray and get back home without the monsters noticing.
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob tiptoeing through the forest, red-eyed monsters watching him from the kelp. SpongeBob is carrying Plankton.]
SpongeBob: [whimpering] They're watching us everywhere, Plankton. [runs] Run for it!
[They run up a set of stairs that turns out to be a monster's scales. They jump off its nose.]
SpongeBob: Nose dive!
[They slide down the back of a snake-like monster. They scream and run past a bunch of monsters.]
SpongeBob: Too many monsters! Ahh!
[They are cornered by a bunch of monsters, who growl and point at the Coco-Hut.]
Plankton: SpongeBob, I have an idea. Follow my lead. [they walk to the Coco-Hut] All right, monsters. We'll go back to work and whip up some nice coconut patties. In fact, we have a big, delicious surprise for you. You just have to close your eyes. [monsters grunt and close their eyes] Good! Now stick your fingers in your ears and sing, ♪ la la la la la la la!
Monsters: ♪ La la la la la la la! ♪
Plankton: Now, run !
[He and SpongeBob hop into the Coco-Hut and turn it into a raft, then set off from the island.]
SpongeBob and Plankton: Whoa! Yeah!
[A line of angry monsters is shouting at them. A red monkey-like monster sees the mother banana monster and eats it.]
SpongeBob: [waving to Monster Island] Goodbye, friends who kept us captive by threatening to eat us! [turns to Plankton] Great thinking back there, Plankton. [takes out coconut drinks] How about we celebrate our victory?
SpongeBob and Plankton: [toast drinks] Cheers!
SpongeBob: Hm, wait. [points backwards] Why are we heading back to the island?
[Monster Island, revealing itself to be a giant turtle monster with the island on its shell, swims after their raft.]
Plankton: I think the island is heading back to us !
SpongeBob: Uh-oh.
Monster Island: [roars]
SpongeBob and Plankton: [screaming]
[At Goo Lagoon, some of the sunbathers scream and run away. Bubble Bass wakes up.]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Comin' through!
Bubble Bass: Hm? [the raft goes towards him and he screams]
[Bubble Bass turns around and shields himself. The raft jumps off Bubble Bass's butt.]
Bubble Bass: Hm? Phew.
[Footsteps are heard as Monster Island approaches Bubble Bass.]
Bubble Bass: [screams]
[Monster Island steps on him, leaving his butt sticking out of the sand. SpongeBob and Plankton sail through the air on their raft.]
SpongeBob: That was a close one!
[They scream and fall through the roof of the Krusty Krab. Squidward reads a magazine at the register boat as Patrick's head is on fire.]
Patrick: Uhhh...
Mr. Krabs: [walks up to them and checks his watch] You're late, SpongeBob. Where have you been the last six years?
SpongeBob: [shakes his head rapidly and then hugs Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: [sighs] Well, it was nice while it lasted. [wipes the count off a sign reading ""Days Without SpongeBob 2192"".]
Plankton: [gets up and sighs]
[The Krusty Krab starts shaking.]
Mr. Krabs: It's an earthquake! Run for your lives!
[SpongeBob, Plankton, and Mr. Krabs run outside. Squidward pushes Patrick outside. Monster Island picks up the Krusty Krab and swallows it whole.]
Mr. Krabs: No! Not me restaurant!
Monster Island: [burps, munches happily and walks away]
[The raft, which has text reading ""Now Serv Coco-Patties"" on the sail, falls in front of Patrick.]
Patrick: I know what I want to eat today! [gestures to raft] I'll have one Coco-Patty.
Mr. Krabs: Comin' right up, for a nominal service charge!
SpongeBob: [giggles] All's well that ends well, eh, Plankton? [sees nobody next to him and gasps] Oh, no! Where's Plankton?
[The Krusty Krab is being digested in Monster Island's stomach. Plankton lays on a Krabby Patty.]
Plankton: Rawr, rawr. We're alone at last. [kisses patty] Muah.
[Plankton and the patty are digested by the stomach acid. A heart-shaped bubble rises out, then pops and splats goo on the screen.]",0.21,"Andrew Goodman,Adam Paloian"

Mr. Krabs is at first uninterested in the parade, but SpongeBob says that it can help with free advertising for the Krusty Krab, which convinces him. Mr. Krabs asks SpongeBob and Squidward to build a float, with Squidward as the designer and SpongeBob as the constructor.The following morning, SpongeBob shows Squidward the finished float, consisting of several Krabby Patties and a giant secret formula bottle, with Squidward's drawing included on one. Sure enough, Plankton is shown spying on SpongeBob and Squidward's conversation, in which he hears that SpongeBob wrote the actual secret formula ingredients on the paper inside the bottle. Plankton decides to enter the parade as a result so he can steal the formula from the float.Perch Perkins and the Ice Cream King commentate on the parade, with the Bikini Bottom High School marching band the first to be introduced. While Plankton observes the parade, the Krusty Krew prepare their float to enter, as the other floats are presented, including Larry's Gym, Mrs. Puff as her balloon, Patrick's rock, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's invisible boatmobile, and Fred's ""My leg"" vehicle. The Krusty Krab float is the last to drive downtown.Plankton, continuing to observe the parade, has finished his float, and drives towards the parade. He drives into the Krusty Krab float, resulting in SpongeBob losing control of the fryers and Squidward getting thrown off the wheel. The Krusty Krab float drives out of control, causing a chain reaction of the other floats crashing into each other. Plankton drives crazily towards the Krusty Krab float, the only one still standing, for the secret formula. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob leave the float, and Plankton's float collides with the Krusty Krab's.After the collision, Squidward reveals Plankton was chasing them because SpongeBob wrote down the actual secret formula for the bottle prop, which shocks Mr. Krabs. The giant secret formula bottle lands at Plankton's float, with him about to read the paper. Soon after, a gas station float enters the parade and it explodes upon contact from a lit match. The explosion results in the secret formula's bottle being ripped apart. Plankton gets one ingredient of the formula, shown to be salt, and thinks that he can obtain the formula by adding in other ingredients. As Perch Perkins prepares to close the parade, the Ice Cream King flies away on the Mrs. Puff balloon.",SpongeBob on Parade,"[At night, SpongeBob is sweeping the Krusty Krab's sign. He sweeps up to the door. A fish dancing to music on his headphones sticks a poster to the door. Mr. Krabs comes out and yells at him.]
Mr. Krabs: Avast, keep your proposal and propaganda mitts away from me door!
Man with posters: Come on, man, I'm just doing my job! [shoves the rest of the posters on Mr. Krabs and runs away]
SpongeBob: [reads poster] ""Come one, come all to the Big Bikini Bottom Parade tomorrow."" Oh, boy! [jumps]
Mr. Krabs: [tears posters off his face, putting his skin on them] Parade? [scoffs] I did enough marching when I was in the navy.
SpongeBob: Ooh, but a parade is a great way to get free advertising for the Krusty-- [Mr. Krabs shushes him with his claw]
Mr. Krabs: [excited] Free? That's me favorite assemblage of letters. What do we do?
SpongeBob: [face pops out] We're gonna have to build a float.
Mr. Krabs: Hmm.
[Squidward walks out and flicks his employee hat off his head.]
Squidward: Well, that was another day wasted.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs Squidward] Your day's not over, Mr. Squidward. I want you and SpongeBob to build a Krusty Krab float for the Bikini Bottom Parade tomorrow.
SpongeBob: [jumps] Oh, yeah! [imitates marching band and marches with his broom]
Mr. Krabs: [looks at watch] You two have ten hours. [SpongeBob keeps marching in the background] And since you're the artistic type, you get to design it.
Squidward: [excited] Design? Okay! [skeptical] Wait, what's the budget?
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's the best part! [pinches claws together] Zero budget! You get to be creative and use your imagerination.
SpongeBob: [waves his broom over Squidward's head, creating a rainbow like in ""Idiot Box""] Imagination! [rainbow falls on Squidward, turning him rainbow, and he shakes it off in frustration]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Can't wait to see your masterpiece. [walks away] Have fun, you two. [laughs]
[Squidward takes out a paper and starts scribbling on it. SpongeBob keeps trying to take a look at it.]
SpongeBob: Whatcha drawing? Lemme see. I wanna see. I wanna see. I wanna see. Come on, show me. Can I see? Can I see? I wanna see.
[They keep spinning around. SpongeBob is on Squidward's shoulders. SpongeBob pulls Squidward's eyelids back. Squidward pushes SpongeBob away with his foot as he reaches for the paper. SpongeBob is drawing on the paper with Squidward watching him.]
SpongeBob: Please? Huh? Whoa!
[After spinning around, Squidward is holding SpongeBob. He throws him away.]
Squidward: Go ahead. Tell me how much you like it. [hands him a paper with a drawing of Squidward playing the clarinet on a float stand] Don't worry, I can take it.
SpongeBob: [looking away] First of all, it's [smiles] genius.
Squidward: [chuckles]
SpongeBob: But it could use a little--
Squidward: [leans over him and yells] Just build it!
[SpongeBob and the paper zoom off. Squidward takes out a folded-up lawn chair and throws it into the air. When it comes down, SpongeBob is sitting on it, wearing gloves and a construction hat and holding a toolbox.]
Squidward: What the!?
SpongeBob: Squidward, where do I find building materials?
Squidward: [picks up chair] I don't care! Anywhere!
[He swings the chair and throws SpongeBob off, sighs, and sits down in it. It snaps and only his nose is sticking out.]
Squidward: Of course.
[Carrying the drawing, SpongeBob walks behind the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: [imitating Squidward] ""I don't care, [waves arms] anywhere."" [sees something] What? [sees a bunch of materials sticking out of the dumpster] Hello, anywhere.
French Narrator: [narrating time card] Ten hours later...
[In the morning, Squidward is sleeping outside the Krusty Krab on the lawn chair. SpongeBob leans over him.]
Squidward: [snores] D--aah! [screams]
[Detailed close-up of SpongeBob's face.]
Squidward: What are you doing!?
SpongeBob: [covered in paint and bandages] You know, [pokes his nose] you look like a little baby octopus when you're asleep.
Squidward: [uncomfortably] What time is it?
SpongeBob: Almost parade time. I finished it! [shows a giant covered tarp] I give you the Krusty Krab parade float.
[SpongeBob removes the tarp. The float has a plate of Krabby Patties with the formula bottle on top. There is a stand with a deep fryer on it, and the Krusty Krab's sign.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da! I made it a little more on theme.
Squidward: It's moron-themed, all right. You didn't even use my drawing.
SpongeBob: Of course, I did. I used it to patch up that hole in the Krabby Patty. [shows the paper duct-taped to a Krabby Patty]
Squidward: [slaps face and groans] Well, whatever. It looks fine, I guess. [looks up] The secret formula bottle almost looks like the real thing.
SpongeBob: It is, just bigger. I even wrote down the secret formula on the paper inside. [laughs and moves closer] Only we know.
[Cut to the Chum Bucket, where Plankton is watching the conversation on a wall of monitors.]
SpongeBob: I even wrote down the secret formula on the paper inside.
[Plankton spits out his coffee and sees the formula bottle.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Only we know.
Plankton: Wrote down the secret formula!? [stretches antenna back] That beautiful idiot! [tents fingers] Looks like I'm going to a parade.
[Downtown, many citizens have gathered to watch the parade. Some are waving green flags. Perch Perkins narrates.]
Perch: Welcome to the annual Bikini Bottom Parade, and it's a beautiful ocean day for it. I'm Perch Perkins, coming to you live from downtown. And with me is this year's co-host, the one and only Ice Cream King. [the Ice Cream King is asleep, and flails wildly when Perch touches him] It's an honor to have you, Your Majesty. Do I call you King or Ice?
Ice Cream King: [gasps] Hey, you're that guy! How'd you get out of my TV, [pinches Perch's cheek] you bad little boy? [squishes Perch's cheeks] Ooh, you're wearing makeup! [close-up of purple makeup on Perch's face] Are you a clown? [shakes him] I want a balloon!
Perch: Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, sure. We'll get you a balloon. [cheers and applause, Pearl and a marching band march past] And to kick off this year's parade here comes the Bikini Bottom High School marching band. You know, even when they're not playing, they love to march together. The band is actually made up of 35 individual bands. Amazing precision from these youngsters!
[The band members make the shape of a flower cloud.]
Ice Cream King: [gasps] They all wore the same outfit. How embarrassing.
[The band members make the shape of a jellyfish.]
Perch: Oh, a perfect jellyfish!
Ice Cream King: That's a jellyfish? I was gonna say a clump of hair.
[A trumpet player splits into two and spins away.]
Perch: Wait, did that kid just separate into two organisms via binary fission? [another one splits and spins away]
Ice Cream King: I've been bicycle fishing. It really hurts. [the crowd cheers as the band members split into more jellyfish, then clear out a rectangular space]
Perch: [laughs] Aren't those kids amazing? [horn honks, boats drive wildly onto the road as pedestrians run away] And what have we here? It's the kooky Nitwitting Club.
[One member jumps out of his boat, dumps his brain out of a bucket, puts it on his head, and runs away. Another one spins on the brain and leaves a trail of drool. The Ice Cream King comes in with a boat on his head, makes engine noises, and rolls around.]
Perch: Okay, the Ice Cream King has joined his fellow Nitwitters. Whoa, I've never seen anyone drive like that before! [crowd cheering]
[Plankton looks out from a peephole in the wall of a shed, right outside the parade streets.]
Plankton: Any minute now, that secret formula will be mine! [strains and pulls his eye out of the hole, and it bounces off his body like a paddleball] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! [groans and falls off]
[At the start of the parade, the Krusty Krab float is between Fred's leg float and a jellyfishing float with a robotic Kevin. Mr. Krabs is on top of the formula bottle and SpongeBob is at the deep fryers.]
Mr. Krabs: Boy, after seeing this float, everyone will rush to the Krusty Krab! How ya set up with those [points down] expired fries, boy-o?
SpongeBob: [takes out baskets] Good and greasy, boss! [puts baskets in grease]
Mr. Krabs: Ready, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: [squished inside the patty] No, I'm not! I can't see a thing with SpongeBob in front of me!
Mr. Krabs: Excellent! It's our turn. [twists his pants] Let's move it out!
[The float crashes through the ""Parade Start"" banner. Bubble transition to the float for Larry's Gym moving past. Two strong fish are lifting weights.]
Perch: Next up we have the Beefy Bros from Larry's Gym. Whoa, look at those meatheads pump iron.
Larry: [lifts up the float and laughs]
Perch: That's some impressive muscle hustle!
[An inflated Mrs. Puff floats down the street, being carried by kids in small boats.]
Perch: And here comes Mrs. Puff. Oh, as her own balloon!
Ice Cream King: Whoa, I want that balloon!
[Patrick's rock slides past, making a scraping sound.]
Perch: Patrick's rock is one float that doesn't float.
Audience: Aah! [covers their ears]
[Bubble Bass gestures on top of the Invisible Boatmobile with Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.]
Perch: Oh, looks like Bubble Bass has hitched a ride with Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. And what's this?
[Fred rides by in a float of his leg.]
Perch: Not to be outdone, it's Fred in his incredible My Leg Mobile.
Fred: My leg! My leg! I'm in my leg!
Ice Cream King: [sniffs and inhales Perch's hair] I smell grease!
Perch: Oh, that's not me you're smelling, King! [pushes Ice Cream King's head as the Krusty Krab float appears] It's the float from the Krusty Krab, serving over a million Krabby Patties daily to hundreds.
Mr. Krabs: [waving] Whoo-hoo! Hey!
Perch: Oh, there's everybody's favorite tightwad... Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [laughs]
Audience: [cheering]
[SpongeBob flicks the fries out of a basket at the spectators.]
Perch: Well, there's something new-- french-fry confetti!
[Spectators eagerly stick out their tongues, but get burned by the grease. Plankton looks out from the shed.]
Plankton: [cackles evilly, then jumps in a float styled like him] Time to meet your doom, Krabs. [puts goggles on and laughs, then speeds out of the shed on the float] Secret formula at 12:00!
Perch: Hang on, folks. It looks like the parade's got a last-minute entry. I'd say it's some kind of [close-up of the float] rancid hot dog on wheels? [Plankton's float rams the Krusty Krab's] No, folks. I believe this is Bikini Bottom's own evil genius, Plankton.
Mr. Krabs: Whoa! [gets shaken off the formula bottle and grabs its cork]
Perch: It didn't take long for anarchy to begin this year.
Mr. Krabs: It's a rogue wave, a nor'easter, a perfect storm!
[Plankton's float rams the Krusty Krab's again. SpongeBob screams as the grease spills out of the fryers.]
Perch: Oh, it's chaos and confusion, a tradition here at the Bikini Bottom Parade.
[SpongeBob grabs onto his fryers and swings them around. Grease spills out and onto Squidward.]
Squidward: [screams]
[Squidward falls out of the back of the float as a fried, live-action piece of calamari. One of the nitwits runs up and bites it.]
Perch: Well, looks like there is something new on the menu!
Squidward: Ow.
Perch: [as Squidward's spot is empty] The Krusty Krab float is coming in hot!
Fred: [chuckles and waves] My leg! [the Krusty Krab float hits him and knocks him away] My Leg Mobile!
[Bubble Bass is waving. Fred's float kicks him into the air.]
Perch: And here we see the domino effect in action.
[Bubble Bass lands in the arms of a weightlifter on Larry's float.]
Weightlifter: Huh? Oh.
Bubble Bass: My champion!
Larry: [grunts] Larry can't lift this kind of weight. [groans and drops the float, making it collapse]
Perch: Ladies and gentlemen, this parade has careened into a calamitous catastrophe of crashing and chaos!
[Plankton's float drives ahead and knocks over the other floats. Everyone screams and runs.]
Plankton: [turns float around and chuckles] Baby wants his secret formula! [cackles evilly]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, Plankton! No, Plankton! No, no!
Plankton: [steps on the gas and cackles, as his float goes forward]
Mr. Krabs: Abandon float! [falls] Whoa!
SpongeBob: [screaming] Aah! Wait for me!
[SpongeBob jumps off the float, then jumps back on to grab a deep fryer. As he jumps away with it, grease spills out and onto the road. Plankton's float slips on it and crashes into the Krusty Krab float, creating an explosion. The sign collapses and breaks the formula bottle, putting the formula in Plankton's float's hand.]
Plankton: It's mine. It's mine! [chuckles goofily]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, why does he want that useless prop, anyway?
Squidward: [with his head bandaged, removing bit of grease] Because SpongeBob wrote the secret formula on that paper!
Mr. Krabs: Wait, what? What? What!? [eyes crack]
Plankton: [grabs formula and chuckles]
[A gas canister float drives up to the wreckage.]
Perch: It looks like one last float from the local gas station is making a combustible entry. [matchbox float lights the gas and causes an explosion] Well, folks, this parade has now officially been declared an apocalypse. [laughs]
Plankton: [reaching for the formula's charred bits] No, no! I almost had it!
Mr. Krabs: [laughs, cheerfully] Come on, boy-o. Let's go back to the Krusty Krab, where I can punish you proper with unpaid overtime for doing such a foolish thing.
SpongeBob: Yay!
Plankton: [with charred scrap of paper] Aha! I got something-- an ingredient to the secret formula. [dances with the paper, which reads ""Salt""] I got an ingredient! I got an ingredient!
Mr. Krabs: [takes paper] Hmm. [reads it] Salt. [returns it to Plankton]
Plankton: That's right, baby. Salt! It's got salt in it. [Mr. Krabs, Squidward, and SpongeBob walk away] I'm cracking the code! All I have to do now is add the right ingredients to salt, and [pupil turns into a star] voilà! I'll have the Krabby Patty secret formula. [walks away] You know, I really am a genius.
Perch: Well, folks, another Bikini Bottom Parade ends in disaster.
Audience: [groaning]
Perch: [seriously] Same as every year. [shrugs] Ah, why not? And now, I'd like to thank my co-host, the Ice Cream King. Hey, King?
Ice Cream King: [chuckles stupidly and rides away on Mrs. Puff, waving]
Perch: King?
Ice Cream King: [laughs] I got my balloon!",0.26,Kaz

He chases it away, but accidentally destroys his statue in the process. The clam flies out the window and to Patrick's house, revealing that SpongeBob had sent him a message. Patrick writes a response and the clam flies back through Squidward's house to deliver it. Squidward goes to SpongeBob and asks them not to send any more clams through his house, and he and Patrick agree.When Squidward is bathing, he hears a knock at the door and puts on a towel to answer it. Two clams fly into his house and spit pearls at him, forcing him outside while being naked. Next, SpongeBob sends lunch to Patrick. Squidward blows a whistle and captures the clams in a box. He sends them on a truck to the chowder factory, but they quickly return as a can of clam chowder. Patrick opens it, and the clams attack Squidward.Squidward goes to bed with an eye mask and headphones to ignore the clams. However, Patrick flies into his house while trying to have the clams deliver himself to SpongeBob. The clams again attack Squidward, leaving SpongeBob and Patrick to teach them how to avoid him so they can keep safely sending messages. Although the training works, the clams invade Squidward's house rather than going after him directly, locking him outside again.Squidward orders a giant scallop in the mail to kill the clams in his house. However, the giant scallop befriends the clams and dances with them, angering Squidward. He throws a rock at the giant one, which enrages it. He, SpongeBob, and Patrick all hide in his house. As they plan to wait until the clams start migrating, the clams pick up Squidward's house and lift it away. SpongeBob and Patrick jump down and use SpongeBob as a mattress for Squidward to land on safely. However, Squidward realizes that he is now free to get away from them, and stays in his house. The clams fly over a volcano and drop the house inside, with Squidward commenting that he still prefers it to being with SpongeBob.",SquidBird,"[The episode begins with Squidward dusting off his own sculpture. He inserts a rose between the Squidward sculpture's nose and teeth.]
Squidward: Finally, I've captured the fiery passion that is, moi.
[Some poop falls onto Squidward's sculpture.]
Squidward: Huh? [looks up to the ceiling to notice that there is a clam there] Oh... how did a clam get here?
[The clam poops on Squidward's face. He wipes it away and the remaining poop forms angry eyebrows. Squidward grumbles, grabs a broom, and approaches his statue.]
Squidward: I'll show you for defiling my art! [swings broom] Yyah!
[The broom knocks the sculpture over, making it shatter.]
Squidward: [screams] Look what you've done! My bust is busted!
[The clam chirps and flies out of the window, to Patrick's house. It lands on Patrick's finger and opens to reveal a rolled-up paper.]
Patrick: Oh, boy! A message! [reads it] ""Hello... Patrick... from... SporgBub."" [puts it down] Ooh, a mystery sender! [closes the clam's mouth with his head, puts it in a cage, takes a pen out of his pants, writes something on the paper, and takes a clam out of the pen] Gotcha! [puts the letter in it, then smacks it on his head and waves at it] Safe travels! [throws the clam into the air] Whoo!
[The clam flies through Squidward's window. The sounds of crashing and Squidward's frustration are heard. The clam flies through the other window to SpongeBob's roof.]
SpongeBob: [excited noises, then sees the clam] Oh, boy! Patrick responded! [the clam opens and he takes out the note] Awww! [on the paper is a very bad drawing of SpongeBob and Patrick] It's a... duck and a chicken... kissing, I think? [a quack and cluck noise are heard]
[SpongeBob's doorbell rings. He puts the clam in a cage.]
SpongeBob: Be right back, clammies! [hums and walks downstairs, then opens the door to see Squidward] Oh, hello, Squidward! Are you trying out a new sunscreen?
Squidward: [covered in clam poop, pauses] ...What? No! It's those stupid clams! Why are they flying through my house?
SpongeBob: They're carrier clams! Patrick and I are ending each other messages.
[A clam lands on SpongeBob's head and coos.]
Squidward: Well, your brainless bivalves are going through my windows and destroying my art! [smacks forehead] Just promise you'll stop sending your clams through my window.
[A clam lands in Squidward's hand and opens its mouth with a letter.]
Squidward: [reads letter] ""Behind you?"" [turns around to see Patrick]
Patrick: We promise!
[Squidward screams and falls over, then walks away grumbling. Bubble transition to him taking a bubble bath.]
Squidward: Ah, peace and quiet. [relaxes, then the doorbell rings] Huh? Oh, that must be the new marble slabs I ordered! [grabs his towel and opens the front door] Hello? [two clams fly in through the door] What? More clams? [shoos them away and drops his towel] Ah, shoo! Shoo!
[The clams shoot pearls at Squidward. He shields himself and runs out of the house. The clams shut the door behind him and lock him out. Squidward struggles to open the door, puts his ear against it, and hears the clams inside.]
Squidward: Oh, that is it ! Time to take matters into my own [pounds fists] tentacles!
[Clams are heard chattering. Patrick looks at his cage of clams.]
Patrick: Hey! It's rude to laugh at Squidward's [points to Squidward] hilarious shame!
[Squidward is naked and covering himself. Bubble transition to a shot of Conch Street. SpongeBob is ringing a triangle on his roof.]
SpongeBob: Patrick! I'm sending over lunch! [throws triangle away]
Patrick: [off-screen] Thank Neptune, I'm starving!
[SpongeBob beckons for the clams and a flock of them rise, holding a paper bag. As the clams take flight, Squidward is hiding behind his house. He laughs sneakily and looks at a clam whistle. When he blows it, the clams zoom off and drop the bag behind. The clams fly behind his house, and construction noises are heard. Squidward wheels out a crate with air holes in it, with the clams trapped inside.]
Squidward: Have fun at the chowder factory! [wheels the box into a Chowder Factory truck, laughs]
[Patrick watches the truck drive past. Squidward grabs the bag and takes out an apple.]
Squidward: Ah, you did it, Squidward. You finally put a stop to those stupid clams. [bites apple]
[A rumbling noise is heard, to Squidward's surprise. He gets flattened by a giant rolling can. the bitten apple lands next to him. The can rolls to Patrick's rock and spins upright to show that it contains clam chowder. A foghorn sounds.]
Patrick: Oh, boy! Chowder! Thanks for the grub, SpongeBob!
[Patrick squishes his head to make his tooth stick out, then jumps on the can and opens it like an electric can opener. The clams fly out, growling. Squidward is rubbing his head and groaning when the clams surround him.]
Squidward: Huh? [nervously] Did you have fun at the chowder factory?
[The clams all spit chowder at Squidward.]
Squidward: [screams] Ow! Hot chowder!
[Bubble transition to Squidward, with welts on his face, growling, staring out the window, and closing the curtains.]
Squidward: Alright, Squidward. [gets into bed] If you can't beat 'em... [puts on headphones] ignore 'em. [puts on sleep mask and laughs]
[Squidward remains in bed as loud crashing is heard. Two of his lamps get knocked over. Squidward grimaces and his eyes pop through his sleep mask. He opens the window and looks outside. Patrick, riding on a flock of clams, smashes his butt into Squidward's face.]
Patrick: Huh? [turns around] Oh, hey, Squidw-- [smashes into the house] Ow!
Squidward: Oh, great. The idiot parade is in town.
Patrick: Oh, no, we don't meet until May. [flips around] Or was it Septembuary? [smashes into house] Ow! I'm just having my carrier clams carry me to SpongeBob's house! [smashes into house] Ow! It's easier this way!
Squidward: Allow me to show you a [pulls out scissors] short cut !
[Squidward snips the ropes carrying Patrick. Patrick screams as he falls. The clams fly up. Patrick's screaming is heard getting fainter, then getting louder, to Squidward's confusion. Patrick flies back up riding the clams.]
Patrick: [screaming] Oh, hi, Squidward!
[The clams shoot pearls at Squidward.]
Patrick: [waving] Thanks, buddy! [flies to SpongeBob's house] See you in Septembuary!
[The clams fly into SpongeBob's cage, dropping Patrick on the ground.]
SpongeBob: [friendly] Hey! What took you so long?
Patrick: [raises head] I ran into traffic. [flops on the ground, and raises head again] And a house!
Squidward: [off-screen] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Oww!
[SpongeBob and Patrick overhear and peek through the leaves of SpongeBob's pineapple. Squidward is screaming and being chased by the clams.]
Patrick: Those clams sure do [clasps hands] love Squidward.
SpongeBob: [looks closer] Oh, I'm not so sure he loves them . Maybe we should train out clams to [raises one hand and motions the other around it] avoid him!
Patrick: [excited] Oh, yeah! Like everybody else does!
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick standing in SpongeBob's house, teaching a classroom of clams. SpongeBob points to a chalk drawing of Squidward, draws an arrow over it, and crosses out Squidward. He gestures to Patrick, who puts on a Squidward nose. Patrick shows off and is attacked by the clams.]
SpongeBob: Hmm...
[Clams transition to a box of clam treats on SpongeBob's shelf. SpongeBob puts the treats on the ground, then motions for the clams to stop in place. He blows a whistle and then finds Patrick eating the treats. He glances up and down between Patrick and the treats. Patrick offers him some, but gets attacked by the clams again.]
SpongeBob: [flinches] Hmm...
[Clams transition to Patrick, covered in bandages, walking out of the kitchen. The clams notice him, and he braces himself. However, SpongeBob blows a whistle and is wearing a clam costume. He marches around Patrick as the clams follow him in a circle. Patrick dances. Clam transition to the text ""Congratulations Grads!"" written on the chalkboard as SpongeBob, Patrick, and the clams all wear graduation caps.]
Patrick: [claps and laughs]
[SpongeBob gives two clams their diplomas. Patrick bites the next diploma out of SpongeBob's hand and eats it. Clam transition to a shot of Squidward's house. A paperboy bikes by.]
Paperboy: Hmmm... [grunts and throws paper]
[The paper hits Squidward's front door. Squidward opens and cautiously looks around.]
Squidward: Hm? Huh?
[He tiptoes outside and hears clams. He shields himself.]
Squidward: Oh, no! Here they come!
[The clams fly past Squidward and into his house.]
Squidward: Huh? [wipes forehead] Phew. [door slams behind him] What the?
[Squidward struggles to open the doorknob, yells and pounds the door with his fists, then looks through the peephole. Clams are dancing in a conga line. They knock over Squidward's bonsai. Squidward growls and then pauses, calming himself down. He grabs the paper.]
Squidward: Well, at least I'm not naked this time.
[Two clams come out of Squidward's house and rip his shirt off. A Bikini Bottom Tours bus drives up.]
Bus driver: ...And on your left, you'll see a naked octopus locked out of his house!
[The bus passengers all takes pictures. Squidward screams and runs behind the house.]
Squidward: [desperately] I can't take it anymore! [seriously] I'll have to fight fire with fire!
[Bubble transition to a teenage delivery man wheeling a giant crate up to Squidward's house. He takes out a clipboard and goes to knock on the door.]
Squidward: [off-screen, whispering] Psst! Over here!
[The delivery man walks to Squidward, who is wearing the newspaper as clothes.]
Delivery man: Sign here to accept the package. [Squidward signs, and he flips the paper] And sign here to accept possibility of injury, maiming, or death. [Squidward signs, and he walks away] Nice knowing you, pal.
Squidward: Finally! My secret weapon! [laughs sneakily]
[Squidward pries the crate open with a crowbar. A giant clam is inside.]
Squidward: A great scallop!
[The giant clam roars in Squidward's face and growls.]
Squidward: [pets it, nervously] Heh heh heh... nice killer clam... Are you hungry?
[The giant clam roars again.]
Squidward: [pries door open] Well, here's a whole buffet! [points inside] Sic 'em, boy!
[The clams are still partying in Squidward's house. The giant clam comes in and roars, scaring them away. It goes into the kitchen and knocks over a fruit bowl, then scares away clams playing poker at the table. The clams fly outside, followed by the big one.]
Squidward: [laughs] Ha, ha! Who's got the clam now? [points at butt] I do! [shakes butt] I got the greatest scallop! I got the greatest scallop!
SpongeBob: Wow, Squidward!
Patrick: Oh, they're so pretty! Look!
Squidward: Huh?
[Squidward sees the giant clam spinning in place as the small ones circle around it. The giant clam jumps over the small ones as a jump rope. It moves up and down the smaller clams as a wavering string, playing a gentle harp melody.]
Squidward: Hey! I bought you to scare those dumb clams, not dance with 'em!
[Squidward picks up a rock and throws it. The giant clam is surrounded by the little clams in a heart shape. When the rock hits it, it growls. It screeches at the other clams, and they all rush towards Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Incoming! [he, Patrick, and Squidward jump out of the way]
[The giant clam smacks into the ground. Squidward screams and rolls away from it. The giant clam spits a pearl. Squidward presses against Patrick's house, and screams towards the incoming pearl.]
SpongeBob: [grabs Squidward and pulls him away] Yoink!
[The pearl pierces through Patrick's house, leaving behind a giant hole in the center.]
Patrick: Boy, is that guy gonna get mad when he gets home!
[SpongeBob and Patrick carry Squidward away from the clams, making panicked effort noises. They all run into Squidward's house. SpongeBob shuts and barricades the door with wooden planks. All the clams circle around Squidward's house.]
Patrick: [panting]
Squidward: There's no escaping them! We're doomed!
SpongeBob: Oh, cheer up, Squidward! At least we have each other!
Squidward: That... doesn't cheer me up. [notices something] Hey! I think the clams left!
[Squidward opens the door. He, SpongeBob, and Patrick peer out. Clams have covered the entirety of Bikini Bottom. The giant clam is atop Squidward's house.]
Squidward: [shuts door] The clams didn't leave. [slumps down]
SpongeBob: Uh... maybe we can just wait 'em out until they migrate? [weak laugh]
Patrick: Yeah. What's another six months? [echoing] Six months? Six months? Six months?
[Suddenly, a giant rumbling is heard. Everyone loses balance.]
Squidward: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What's happening?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [straining noises]
[The house tilts, making them fall with it. Squidward opens one window, and SpongeBob and Patrick open another. The house is being lifted with ropes by the giant clam. The little clams push the house up from the bottom.]
Patrick: I think we're migrating!
SpongeBob: [seriously] Patrick! Commence Operation Shooting Star!
Patrick: What? You mean, like, [points down] jump out of the window?
SpongeBob: [happily] Uh-huh. Yeah. Jump out the window.
Patrick: Oh, okay!
[Patrick grabs SpongeBob and leaps out of the window on him. SpongeBob inflates himself with his thumb and lands softly on the ground. Squidward is worried.]
Patrick: [beckoning] Jump! Squidward! Jump!
SpongeBob: [waving arms] You're next, Squidward!
Squidward: [worried] Uh... Oh no! I'm getting farther away! [harp sound plays] Wait a minute! I'm... getting farther away! [looks down, then waves a handkerchief] So long, boys!
[SpongeBob and Patrick stare up at him, then glance at each other.]
Squidward: I'm finally movin' on up! [laughter]
[The clams drop Squidward's house into a volcano. It erupts lava, then smoke.]
Squidward: [weakly] Still better than living next to SpongeBob.
[The episode irises out on the volcano.]",0.25,Danny Giovannini

Mrs. Puff comes out and tells the audience that she will help student drivers learn the rules to earn their license.Lesson #1: ""The Five-Point Pre-Check."" Squidward demonstrates checking his boat before driving: checking the tire buoyancy, ensures the propeller is oiled, confirms the horn works, tests his signals, and fastens his seatbelt. SpongeBob is used to demonstrate improper driving: he over-inflates his tires, dumps too much oil on the propeller and splashes it on Squidward, honks the horn too hard, and spins his signals fast enough that the boat takes flight. While putting his seatbelt on, he wraps it around the entire boat. Its tires pop and it falls onto Squidward's boat. SpongeBob asks if he can get his license now, and Mrs. Puff says no.Lesson #2: ""Entering Traffic."" Squidward, still injured, inches forward and waits for traffic to clear up. When the roads are clear, he looks both ways and moves forward slightly. SpongeBob comes from the side and rams into him, sending Squidward's boat flying into a billboard. SpongeBob asks for his license again, and Mrs. Puff says no.Lesson #3: ""Spotting Pedestrians."" Squidward watches out for pedestrians: he swerves around an old lady and a baby. When he is about to run into a fruit cart, he lifts his boat up to evade it. He then spots two workers carrying a pane of glass, but runs off two boards and a truck as a ramp to go over them. SpongeBob suddenly jumps into his way, bouncing on a pogo stick. Squidward almost runs into the old lady again, but she reveals her muscles and destroys his car, throwing it into a garbage truck. SpongeBob bounces into the camera, asking for his license.Due to a missing reel, the video skips ahead to Lesson #29: ""Navigation."" Squidward, now heavily bandaged and with his boat damaged, first runs over some speed bumps. Next, he sees children crossing, but they are so slow that he drives around them. Overwhelmed by directions, Squidward checks his map and goes into the freeway -- only for Mrs. Puff to narrate that reading a map while driving is bad driving etiquette, to his embarrassment. SpongeBob shows up driving the wrong way, skidding against Squidward's boat and sending him out of control. Squidward's boat goes off an unfinished bridge and explodes.The reel skips ahead to Lesson #53: ""Proper Passenger Etiquette."" An even more injured Squidward is driving with SpongeBob as his passenger. SpongeBob tells Squidward that he will earn his license, jumping on the dashboard and blocking his vision. Squidward pushes him away. When Mrs. Puff tells him not to be a ""backseat driver,"" he grabs hold of Squidward's brace and makes him drive out-of-control. Next, SpongeBob turns up the music too loud, then sets the AC too cold and too hot. He sets the car in reverse, almost crashing into the children until Squidward takes control again. Squidward shoves SpongeBob in the glove compartment.Lesson #54: ""Road Rage."" Patrick passes Squidward, making him angry and leading him to speed up. Mrs. Puff narrates an acronym, ""RAGE: Relax And Go Elsewhere."" SpongeBob comes out of the glove compartment and helps Squidward relax through deep breathing, drinking tea, and raking a small Zen garden. Just after Squidward is finally relaxed, it turns out that the car is completely stopped and there is a long line of traffic behind them. Squidward tries to start the car, but it sputters instead. A large trucker steps out and grabs Squidward. Before he can punch him, the film itself burns up and disintegrates.The episode switches format, with only the character's silhouettes being seen against the projector. SpongeBob tries to fix it, but gets caught in it himself. Mrs. Puff tells him to get out, and says that they cannot finish the film, walking off as the class cheers. SpongeBob still wants to finish class and get his license, so he tries to make the video himself.SpongeBob's ""film"" opens with a crudely-drawn prop of his driver's license. SpongeBob narrates that he was such a good driver that he got a ceremony in his honor. He then brings peace to the world by delivering Krabby Patties, catching criminals, and preventing the ice caps from melting. In the final shot, cutouts of Mrs. Puff and Squidward start kissing him.Mrs. Puff snaps and turns the lights on, revealing SpongeBob making the video himself using paper cut-outs in front of the projector screen. She dismisses the students, then throws SpongeBob's cut-outs into the fireplace. The students drive their desks out of class, but Mrs. Puff grabs SpongeBob and takes him back in. She confiscates his paper license, tears it up, then kicks him out of class and slams the door.",Yellow Pavement,"[The episode opens with the text ""PICTURE START"" written in white against a black screen, then inverting. An old-timey countdown plays. More text appears, reading ""Safety At Sea: 'An Educational Boating Film.'"" It flickers to a shot of the outside of Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Mrs. Puff comes out of the front door.]
Mrs. Puff: Hello, student drivers! I'm Mrs. Penelope Puff, and, as per the court order, I will be your driving instructor in this educational film. By remembering these [takes out list] 138 simple rules of the road, [throws list away] every one of you will know all that you need to get your very own boating license.
[Cut to SpongeBob having crashed a boat into a brick wall.]
SpongeBob: [spaced out] Even me?
Mrs. Puff: [shrugs, disappointed] Ugh.
[Text appears saying ""#1 The Five Point Pre Check.""]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] First lesson: the five point pre check
[The text disappears to show Squidward standing next to a boat.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Here we have Mr. Good Driver. Before starting the vehicle, he always inspects five areas of his boat for safety.
[Squidward nods.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] He checks his tire buoyancy...
[Squidward kneels down to the boat's tires, points at a meter, and reads it.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Ensures his motor is properly oiled...
[Squidward squeezes a small drop of oil onto the boat's motor, then flicks it.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Confirms his boat horn is functioning...
[Squidward is inside the boat, and he honks his horn twice.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Reviews his signals...
[Two flags come out of the boat and move in various directions.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] And most importantly, he fastens his seatbelt.
[Squidward fastens his seatbelt and clasps his hands as a halo appears above him. The camera pans over to show SpongeBob standing at another boat.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] And here we have a bad driver, or, what I refer to as ""a SpongeBob.""
SpongeBob: Check tire pressure! [He inflates all the boat's tires to a large size.] Oil propeller: check! [He dumps a bucket of oil onto the propellor, which spins rapidly and splatters on Squidward, who grumbles.] Check horn: check! [He honks the horn very hard.]
Horn: [screaming] Out of the way!
[Squidward is blown back by the horn's noise, also spraying the oil off him.]
SpongeBob: Check signals! Checkareeno!
[SpongeBob twirls his signal flags so fast that the boat takes flight.]
SpongeBob: Seatbelt! [stretches it and ties it around the entire boat] Belted! [The boat falls and the tires pop, sending it flipping backwards onto Squidward] Whoa! [comes out of the overturned boat and waves] Can I get my license now?
[The word ""NO"" is stamped on the screen.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] No.
[Text appears saying ""#2 Entering Traffic""]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Now to our second lesson: entering traffic.
[Cut to Squidward, who has a black eye and a bump on his head as stars circle around him.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] As he begins his journey, Mr. Good Driver makes sure to watch carefully for oncoming boats.
[Squidward goes forward, and two lines of boats are in front of him. He looks to his sides, and the traffic clears up, leaving the road empty.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Only when the road is clear does he accelerate into traffic.
[Squidward looks to his sides, and no boats are coming. He inches forward. Suddenly, SpongeBob drives in from the left and crashes into him.]
SpongeBob: Beep beep!
[Squidward's boat smashes into a billboard that says ""Yum! Dogs!"" with a fish eating a hot dog, with his boat covering the hot dog.]
SpongeBob: [waving] Can I get my license now?
[The word ""NO"" is stamped on the screen again.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] No!
[Text appears saying ""#3 Spotting Pedestrians""]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Lesson 3: spotting pedestrians.
[Squidward is driving on the road, now with a bandaged head, a bandage on his nose, two black eyes, and a scratched boat.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] There are several types of pedestrians, so Mr. Good Driver always keeps careful watch.
[Squidward puts on a safari hat and takes out binoculars, then starts looking around him. He sees an old lady doing acrobatics across the street.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Here we have the cunning little old lady.
[Squidward screams in surprise, then drives around her. He looks ahead and sees a baby in a carraige.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Ah, and the babbling baby in a buggy.
[The baby spits out its pacifier.]
Baby: [angry gibberish]
[Squidward swerves around the baby and continues driving. A starfish is seen with a cart of fruit.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] The common fruit vendor...
[Squidward pulls his boat up, and it goes over the fruit cart. Two worker fish come out of the sewer holding a pane of glass. They notice Squidward and begin sidestepping to avoid him.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] And, naturally, we see some workmen carrying a large pane of glass.
Squidward: How cliche!
[He notices a truck with two wooden boards as ramps behind it. He drives off of it to go clear over the workers, who gasp and watch. Sunglasses fall onto Squidward's face.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Mr. Good Driver may think he can let his guard down, but there's still one pedestrian waiting to strike.
[A trash can rumbles. SpongeBob's eyes peer out of it, and he jumps out onto the street with a pogo stick. He stops in front of Squidward, and the screen freezes with the caption ""Poriferous Aggravatus.""]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] The rare Poriferous Aggravatus. Commonly known as ""a SpongeBob.""
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward!
[Squidward screams and starts swerving, but SpongeBob keeps jumping in front of him.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! Hi, Squidward! Hi, Squidward! Hi, Squidward!
[Squidward screams and notices the old lady from before. She flexes her muscles, and the boat crashes into her. She smashes it up and throws it into a garbage truck. SpongeBob gets off his pogo stick and jumps towards the screen.]
SpongeBob: Hey! Can I get my license now?
[Text appears saying ""REEL MISSING"". It switches to ""#29 Navigation"".]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Lesson 29: navigation.
[Squidward now has a neck brace and bandaged arms, and his boat is in worse condition.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Mr. Good Driver must obey various road signs. Here are just a few. [a sign with a tire appears] Speed bumps...
[Squidward drives over many speeds bumps in succession, sputtering as he does. A sign with three kids on it appears.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Slow children at play...
[Squidward runs into three children crossing the street. They move in slow-motion. Squidward gets impatient waiting for them to pass and drives around them. As he keeps driving, he sees a massive amount of road signs.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Sometimes even Mr. Good Driver may be overwhelmed with directions.
[Squidward panics and takes out a map as he heads onto the freeway.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Never read a road map while driving. That's something only a SpongeBob would do.
[Squidward laughs nervously and packs up the map. SpongeBob is heading the opposite direction, reading an open map. Passengers scream and swerve around him.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward!
[Squidward screams and his boat collides with SpongeBob's. He is sent spinning out of control and slides off of an unfinished exit. His boat explodes, and the reel skips. Text displays ""#53 Proper Passenger Etiquette.""]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Lesson 53: proper passenger etiquette.
[Squidward now has his arm and head in a cast, with a blood drip hooked to his arm. His feet are bandaged. SpongeBob sits in the passenger seat.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Good driving also means being a good passenger. Never distract your driver.
SpongeBob: Guess what, Squidward? I'm gonna get my license today! [slides onto the dashboard] Mrs. Puff said at the end of the film, I'm gonna get it!
[Squidward can't see the road with SpongeBob blocking his view.]
Squidward: Oh, you're gonna ""get it,"" alright! [shoves him into the backseat]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] It's also important not to be a backseat driver.
SpongeBob: Ooh! I can drive from the backseat?
[SpongeBob grabs Squidward's head brace and twists his neck, causing the boat to go out of control.]
Squidward: That's it! You're driving me crazy!
[The boat halts, and SpongeBob falls back into the passenger seat. Squidward starts driving again.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Finally, as a passenger, you must never play with the boat's control console.
SpongeBob: Ah, let's get some tunes goin' here!
[SpongeBob turns the radio on, and techno music plays, causing the boat to bump up and down and buildings' windows to break.]
SpongeBob: How about some AC?
[SpongeBob turns the AC to the left, causing a large blast of snow. He and Squidward look like snowmen.]
SpongeBob: Brrr! Too cold!
[He turns the AC to the right, causing a blast of flame that melts the snow. Squidward is burned, with three flames on his head brace.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, let me help you with that!
[As he goes to put out a flame, he grabs onto the gear stick and puts it into reverse. The boat speeds backwards. The children are still at play.]
Children: [slow-motion] Oh no!
[Squidward grabs the gear stick and puts the boat back into drive. SpongeBob giggles nervously, and Squidward growls and shoves him into the glove compartment.]
[Text appears saying ""#54 Road Rage""]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Lesson 54: road rage.
[Squidward is driving angrily.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] Even Mr. Good Driver may be tempted to take his anger out on a fellow motorist...
[Patrick drives up and passes Squidward. Squidward gets angry, his head cast breaks off, his face goes red, and he slams on the gas pedal.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] In times like these, remember one simple word: RAGE. [the word appears as a caption] Relax And Go Elsewhere. [the rest of the text appears]
SpongeBob: [in glove compartment] Oh, I know this one! [lets himself out, buckles his seatbelt, and rubs Squidward's head] Let me help you relax, friend. Just breathe in... and out.
[Squidward does, and the redness from his face disappears.]
SpongeBob: That's it. [takes out tea] Now how about a relaxing cup of kelp tea?
[He pours the tea in Squidward's mouth. Squidward sighs and smiles.]
SpongeBob: Refreshing, right?
Squidward: Mmm-hmmm.
SpongeBob: Now, let's rake some sand.
[SpongeBob pours a bucket of sand on the dashboard. Squidward rakes a small spiral around a rock, then smile at each other.]
SpongeBob: There. Relaxed...
[Their boat is completely stopped. There is a long line of angry passengers behind it.]
SpongeBob: Maybe it's time to go elsewhere?
[Squidward tries to start the boat, but it sputters. A large trucker steps out of his truck and grabs Squidward, then winds up to punch him. Before he does, the film itself disintegrates, leaving nothing but a gray projector screen. Characters' shadows are seen as they talk.]
Mrs. Puff: This darn projector! Just when we were getting to the good part!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff! Let a good noodle handle that for ya!
Mrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, that's okay!
[SpongeBob walks up to the screen and tries to pull it open. He gets sucked in headfirst, and his entire body takes up the screen.]
SpongeBob: Huh? Huh? [looks at screen] I'm ready for my close-up! [laughs]
Mrs. Puff: Get out of there!
SpongeBob: [nervously] Yes, ma'am!
[SpongeBob detaches himself from the projector.]
Mrs. Puff: Ugh! Well, I guess we can't finish the film... [walks off]
[The students start cheering.]
SpongeBob: B-b-but if we can't finish the film, we can't finish class!
[The students cheer again.]
SpongeBob: And if we can't finish class, then I can't get my license!
[The students cheer again.]
SpongeBob: I know! I'll finish the film myself!
[The students boo.]
[SpongeBob sticks his foot against the projector.]
SpongeBob: [narrating] And now, the moment you've all been waiting for! [scatting]
[SpongeBob holds up a poorly-made prop driver's license on a stick and waves it around.]
SpongeBob: [narrating] SpongeBob's boating license! SpongeBob was such an exemplary driver...
Mrs. Puff: [narrating, exasperated] Oh, please ...
[The screen wraps up to show a City Hall backdrop. A cutout of SpongeBob sits on a throne.]
SpongeBob: [narrating] That a special ceremony was held in his honor at City Hall! It was a dream come true!
[A cutout of Mrs. Puff descends, holding a license.]
SpongeBob: [narrating] Mrs. Puff had deemed him worthy of the road!
[A poorly constructed model of SpongeBob holds up the license.]
SpongeBob: [narrating] He finally had a dazzling, genuine, full-sized boating license!
[A cutout of SpongeBob drives on top of a rotating image of Earth.]
SpongeBob: [narrating] Now, imbued with the power of good driving, [the Earth flips to reveal a peace sign] SpongeBob brought peace to the people of this troubled world!
[A cutout of SpongeBob drives up to a house, then throws a giant Krabby Patty at the person inside. The person's frown flips upside down and hearts appear.]
SpongeBob: [narrating] He delivered Krabby Patties to the hungry!
[Cutouts of a robber stealing a purse from an old lady are shown. SpongeBob's boat drives up, opens its front as a mouth, and a tongue grabs and eats the robber. The lady holds up her purse.]
SpongeBob: [narrating] He de-escalated petty crime!
[A cutout of SpongeBob pushes a frowning iceberg into another one, making them smile and hug.]
SpongeBob: [narrating] And he even kept the ice caps from melting!
[A cutout of SpongeBob stands in front of a heart backdrop.]
SpongeBob: [narrating] Yes, everyone loved SpongeBob more than ever now that he had his boating license! They all loved him sooo much! Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah!
[Cutouts of Mrs. Puff and Squidward start kissing SpongeBob. In the classroom, Mrs. Puff seethes in anger.]
Mrs. Puff: [angry] That is quite enough!
[She slams her fist into the light switch, causing the lights to come on and the switch to fall off. Cut to SpongeBob, surrounded by craft supplies, making the movie in front of the projector screen.]
Mrs. Puff: We'll resume the correct lesson next week. Class is dismissed. [clasps hands] Just remember what you learned today... [grabs cutouts] And no more of this nonsense!
[She wads up the cutouts and throws them into a fireplace.]
Students: Yes, Mrs. Puff.
[They rev up their desks like boats and drive out. SpongeBob is the last, and Mrs. Puff grabs him before he can leave the school. Mrs. Puff holds out her hand, and SpongeBob laughs nervously. He gives her his prop license, which she tears apart. Mrs. Puff kicks him out of the school.]
SpongeBob: Beep beep!
[Mrs. Puff glares at him and then slams the door shut, ending the episode.]",0.21,Danny Giovannini

He sees a truck running next to the Chum Bucket, with workers loading Plankton's belongings into it. Plankton walks up to Krabs and says that he is leaving for good to travel the world with Karen. Krabs is skeptical, but SpongeBob then cries at Plankton leaving and says that he will miss him. Plankton and Karen close the truck and drive off, and the Chum Bucket is promptly demolished.Mr. Krabs, now realizing that he no longer has to worry about his formula being stolen, dances and gloats. Soon, construction workers drop a flower shop on top of the empty Chum Bucket lot. Not wanting to get into another feud, Mr. Krabs decides to start on the right foot with the store's owner. He steps inside and is greeted by a kindly woman named Petunia. She is already familiar with the Krusty Krab, since it is her favorite restaurant, and tells him to stop by anytime.After Krabs leaves, it is revealed that Petunia is actually Plankton piloting a robot, planning to steal the secret formula. Just then, SpongeBob comes in and enthusiastically smells the flowers. He wants to buy a sunflower, which is actually Karen in disguise, and Petunia guides him away. Squidward enters, annoyed by SpongeBob not being at work, to fill customers' orders. SpongeBob leaves, and Squidward immediately falls in love with Petunia. Petunia gives him a complimentary begonia, but a jellybee comes out of it and stings Squidward's nose, making his face swell up and causing him to run out of the flower shop in horror.After working in the shop for longer, Karen realizes that nobody is suspicious of Plankton yet. Plankton, however, has gotten used to his disguise and enthusiastically heads out to deliver flowers, spreading cheer to people around town. Back at the shop, Petunia sells many bouquets, including one to Squidward. Krabs comes in to get Squidward back to work, and Petunia shows him a giant bag of flowers he ordered. Krabs and SpongeBob carry the flowers back to the Krusty Krab.Karen tells Plankton that their plan is nearing completion. However, Plankton is losing interest in the formula, wanting to become a full-time florist instead. Annoyed, Karen reminds him that he sold explosive flowers to the Krusty Krab to steal the formula. Plankton uses his Petunia disguise and runs into the Krusty Krab, taking everyone's flowers before they can explode. Krabs whispers to Squidward that he thinks something is wrong with Petunia, but this inspires him to profess his love to her and Squidward could not keep putting it off.Petunia is carrying the explosive flowers back to the flower shop. Squidward interrupts her, offering her a begonia from his own garden and proposing to her. Just then, the bouquet explodes, and Plankton's disguise is exposed; an embarrassed Squidward goes off and buries himself. A furious Krabs leads his customers to step on Plankton, but he is rescued by SpongeBob, who is relieved to have Plankton back. Suddenly, Plankton takes out a remote and renovates the flower shop back into the Chum Bucket. He reveals two lasers from the restaurant and blasts them towards the customers, making them run away. Plankton cheers, ""I'm back, baby!,"" only to imitate Petunia once more.",The Flower Plot,"[The episode opens with a wide shot of the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [opens the door] Ah! [sniffs the air and breathes it out] I always make lots of money when the morning air smells this good. [inhales again and coughs smoke] Huh? [clears smoke out of the way and looks over to the Chum Bucket] Hmm... What in Finnegan's footlocker?
SpongeBob: [exits Krusty Krab in shock and gasps] Looks like Plankton is moving away, Mr. K!
Mr. Krabs: Heh! Yeah, right. He's plannin' something. [continues to look]
Plankton: Well Eugene... I'm leaving for good. Karen and I are gonna travel the world. Before I take it over. Heh-heh-heh. [slaps his leg in laughter]

Plankton: Well, I don't know about that.
Karen: Huh?
Plankton: Actually, I was thinking of putting my plan on hold for a while.
Karen: Wha-at?
Plankton: To becoming a full-time florist! I love making customers smile! And I really think I have a knack for flower arranging! [showcases a swan flower bed he's been building] Boom.
Karen: Awww, that's so sweet! My little man wants to be a florist. [pinches Plankton's cheek]
Plankton: It's my new dream!
Karen: Enjoy that dream while ya can, honey, ya gotta 'bout five minutes.
Plankton: Whaddaya mean?
Karen: [shows pixelated vizuals on her screen] Don't you remember your plan? You sell exploding flowers to Krabs, wait for the timers to go off, and while everyone is freakin' out, you walk right in and take the formula!
Plankton: Neptune's nosehairs! [jumps in shock] - I forgot! I've gotta stop those flowers from blooming and save my new career!
Petunia: Huh? [exits the Pot]
Mr. Krabs: Doo-de-doo-doo-doo..
Petunia: [runs into the KK's doors] Ahhh-heh!
Mr. Krabs: Ah, Petunia!
Petunia: [falls onto the floor]
Mr. Krabs: Eeee-oh. [looks at Petunia on the floor, then looks at the restaurant] Look how your beautiful flowers have brightened up the Krusty Krab!
Petunia: That's great, Eugene-huhhhh! [pushes Krabs to the floor]
Mr. Krabs: Woah!
Petunia: [takes away the KK's flowers, one by one] Pardon me, huh? Pardon me, huh? Pardon me, huh? Pardon me, huh?
Squidward: Huh-m..Ohh-aaahhhh.... [looks love-smittenly at Petunia]
Petunia: [enter's SpongeBob's workplace] Pardon me, huhhhhh?
SpongeBob: Don't forget this! [holds it and points his spatula at a bomb]
Petunia: [grabs away bomb] I'll just freshen these florets and bring them right back, huh-huh? [rips away flowers and runs to defuse them]
Mr. Krabs: [quietly talks to Squidward] I wonder what's wrong with Petunia.
Squidward: Huh? Nothing's wrong with her! She's a perfectionist, like me! [hops onto his cashier stand] I'm in love with her, and I can't keep it a secret any longer! [rips open his shirt and runs to the Flower Pot] Petunia! [quietly laughs]
Petunia: [gasps as she runs to the pot] I've got exactly one minute to defuse these bombs-
Squidward: [disrupts Petunia's escapades and is seen standing at the Pot] I picked this begonia from my own flower garden, huh? [blinks cutely]
Petunia: Oooh, that's a nice one, but I can't right now Mr. Tentacles, please step aside! Mmmm.... [grunts as she holds the bomb]
Squidward: [holds out the begonia ring] Petunia the florist, will you ma- [Petunia explodes in Squidward's face, leaving him charred and stunned] Huh-huh?!
[The begonia ring disintegrates into dust.]
Plankton: You loopy, lovesick lummox! You sabotaged my whole plan!
[Squidward groans in embarrassment, walks off, and rubs out a pile of sand over himself to make it look like a grave. A new flower pops up while doing so.]
Plankton: Woah! [spits and hops out of Petunia] Uh-oh...
[A crowd angrily surrounds Plankton.]
Mr. Krabs: [growls] Not only did you play with Squidward's heart- [scene cuts to a sand-covered Squidward] but ya cost me twenty-four bouquets! I say we step on 'im!
Crowd: Yeah! [subsequent angry noises]
Plankton: Oopsy-daisy, huh?
SpongeBob: [picks up Plankton with his shoe and cries waterfall tears of joy] Petunia was very nice but I'm so glad you're back, Plankton.
Plankton: Thanks, Sponge-Boob. You've given me the greatest gift I could ever ask for - just enough time to do this!
[The Flower Pot transforms back into the Chum Bucket.]
Karen: [grabs Plankton back into the Chum Bucket] Let's go, buttercup.
Plankton: Toodle-loo! [evilly laughs] No more flowers! It's back to the secret formula to me! [laughs again, but a spiked shoe flies at him] My iris!
Crowd: [throw out objects and make angry noises, although SpongeBob seems to avoid committing to any violence]
[Laser guns pop out of the Chum Bucket.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh-no...
Crowd: [lasers are shot in their direction] Ahhhhh!

He stops there, noticing Patrick is holding a mallet. Patrick smashes himself with the mallet, not wanting to grow a nose, which causes a tooth to fall out of him. SpongeBob tells him that leaving a tooth for the Tooth Fairy will give him a quarter, so Patrick smashes himself again so he can leave more teeth under his pillow.That night, Dorsal Dan sneaks into Patrick's house attempting to rob him, but is unsuccessful and gets punched by him. Glitter falls into Dorsal Dan, with Patrick thinking that he is the Tooth Fairy, so he kidnaps him and goes to show him to SpongeBob. Patrick enters SpongeBob's bedroom and shows him the ""Tooth Fairy."" SpongeBob believes that Dorsal Dan is the Tooth Fairy as well, and he and Patrick want to take a trip with him. At first, Dorsal Dan questions their belief, but then decides to go along with it for his own purpose of robbing people.They first stop at Bubble Bass's house, with SpongeBob and Patrick looking for teeth, and Dorsal Dan going for his money. SpongeBob and Patrick manage to extract a tooth out of Bubble Bass's mouth. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Dorsal Dan go around more houses through town, with SpongeBob and Patrick getting the teeth as Dorsal Dan robs people for their valuables, but gets harmed every time.Dorsal Dan prepares for his last stop, but SpongeBob interrupts him so they can go inside Mr. Krabs' house. As they go inside the house, SpongeBob warns Dorsal Dan of security traps, in which one is set off by Patrick. Mr. Krabs comes down, confused, and soon tells SpongeBob and Patrick that Dorsal Dan is not the real Tooth Fairy. Dorsal Dan tries to convince SpongeBob and Patrick still, as they leave Mr. Krabs' house.The police chase SpongeBob, Patrick, and Dorsal Dan as they end up at the top of a cliff. SpongeBob and Patrick then push Dorsal Dan off the cliff, as they say that he can fly, being the ""Tooth Fairy."" Dorsal Dan ends up injured, as the actual Tooth Fairy soon appears, complimenting SpongeBob and Patrick for their efforts of collecting teeth. She rewards them by making them her assistants and giving them the ability to fly.",Ain't That the Tooth,"[The episode begins at sunset, where SpongeBob is in a sweater, riding his unicycle away from the Krusty Krab. He begins spinning as he rides past a sulking Patrick in a sweater while holding a mallet.]
SpongeBob: [singing] ♪ La la la la la la la! La la la la la la la! La la la la la la la! ♪ Hi, Patrick! I just had another great day-- [stops unicycle] wait a minute. [gets off bike, approaches Patrick] Hey, what's wrong?
Patrick: I think I'm growing a nose. [zoom into tooth sticking out of his face] I don't want a nose!
SpongeBob: Patrick, wait!
[Patrick hits his face with the mallet. He takes the mallet off of his face and notices his tooth fall out.]
SpongeBob: [picks up tooth] Hey, look, Patrick. You just lost a tooth. And if you put that tooth under your pillow tonight, the Tooth Fairy will come and take the tooth and leave you a quarter.
Patrick: A quarter for just one tooth?
[Patrick hits himself with the mallet again, and his eyes turn into casino slots, which both turn into teeth. Piles of teeth come out of his mouth.]
Patrick: [in pile of teeth, more come out of his mouth] Jackpot!
French Narrator: [narrating time card] Later that night...
[Inside Patrick's house, he is in his sleepwear while holding his pile of teeth.]
Patrick: Good night, teethies.
[Patrick buries the teeth with a sand pillow he makes. He claps twice to turn off the rock's lights, and hops on his bed and begins snoring. Each time he snores, another tooth shoots out of his mouth. A pair of eyes appear next to where Patrick's teeth land. The burglar steps out from the sand wall. He is revealed to be Dorsal Dan as he stands over Patrick.]
Dorsal Dan: [holding out bag as he takes Patrick's wallet] Who says a life of crime doesn't pay? [money in Patrick's wallet disintegrates as it is made from sand, and the wallet follows] Huh? What the--?
Patrick: [punches Dorsal Dan in his sleep] Sleep punch! [snores]
[Dorsal Dan gets on roller skates walks backward, losing his balance.]
Dorsal Dan: Whoa! [falls into pile of teeth] Ow! [hits lamp and bucket of paint, then stumbles into a closet]
[A box labelled ""SURPLUS GLITTER"" falls onto Dorsal Dan's head, putting glitter onto it.]
Patrick: [waking up] Who goes there?
[Dorsal Dan steps on a flashlight as he appears with a skirt, glitter all over him. He is also holding a pinwheel and wearing a hat with a tooth on it. He has coat hangers for wings. Dorsal Dan looks left and right.]
Patrick: The Tooth Fairy! I gotta show SpongeBob! [captures Dorsal Dan with a sack and runs off]
Dorsal Dan: Hey, come on!
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob's house at night. SpongeBob is sleep-laughing soundly in his bed. He wakes up when he hears Patrick's voice.]
Patrick: [on top of bed diving board] SpongeBob! You were right! [shaking diving board] The Tooth Fairy came, and I got him! [dumps Dorsal Dan out of the bag, releasing him along with tons of glitter]
SpongeBob: [flinching] Ahh! [opens bloodshot eyes] Ooh!
Dorsal Dan: [shaking, scared] I didn't do it!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick, you-you-you really did catch the Tooth Fairy!
Patrick: I told ya! [both laugh as they jump on the diving board and break it, landing on the bed and launching Dorsal Dan]
Dorsal Dan: [hits Shelley's cage as he floats in a circle on a rope]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow.
Patrick: He didn't give me a quarter, [takes out bag, then takes out some jewels] but look. I found these [Dorsal Dan falls down, taking the bag with him] precious jewels in his bag.
Dorsal Dan: What are you [snatches jewels] chowderheads yapping about? [puts jewels back in bag] Tooth Fairy?
SpongeBob: [slides on ground] Don't worry. You don't have to [touches Dorsal Dan's hat] play dumb with us. Your secret is safe.
Patrick: [gets off bed, begging] Please let us ride along with you tonight.
SpongeBob: [begging] And be your Tooth Fairy assistants.
Dorsal Dan: [thinking, then grinning as he pushes both their hands away] Yeah. [points to himself] I'm the Tooth Fairy. And I could use a little help scoring loot-- I mean, collecting teeth.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [hugging Dorsal Dan] Yay! [kissing Dorsal Dan]
Dorsal Dan: [groans] It's gonna be a long night.
[Bubble transition to a far-away view of Conch Street at night. A vehicle drives away from SpongeBob's house. Dorsal Dan is now driving in downtown Bikini Bottom.]
SpongeBob: [getting in front of Dorsal Dan, pointing] Ooh, hey! I bet we could find some teeth here. Pull over. [grabs steering wheel, making Dorsal Dan scream]
[The vehicle stops, and the trio tiptoe behind the house.]
SpongeBob: Now, this guy drinks a lot of soda, so I'm sure he's got a few loose teeth for us.
Patrick: [grabs mallet] Let's get him.
Dorsal Dan: [grabs masks from sack] Here, use these, uh, special Tooth Fairy masks.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [squeal excitedly]
[In black-and-white, a TV scene is shown. A crab is sleeping on his bed as another sneaks by and enters the open window.]
Crab thief: [laughs and approaches other crab, and the scene is revealed to be on Bubble Bass' TV]
[In Bubble Bass' messy basement, he is on the sofa, snoring. Footsteps are heard as Dorsal Dan removes the vent from inside the basement and laughs as he uses suction cups to climb inside. SpongeBob and Patrick land on Bubble Bass, and SpongeBob gets launched into the air and into the ceiling. Dorsal Dan pulls him out, revealing that Mama Bass is sleeping above. He also pulls Patrick from Bubble Bass' mouth.]
Dorsal Dan: [panting and sweating, gets up and stands SpongeBob and Patrick upright, facepalms] Amateurs.
Patrick: [pointing] Hey, look, it's Bubble--
Dorsal Dan: [grabs Patrick] Can it! Now, why don't you mugs shake down Tiny here for some teeth? I'm gonna look for teeth in those [points] valuables over there. [cackles, then SpongeBob and Patrick follow] [walking off] Only the Tooth Fairy gets to laugh like that.
SpongeBob: Shh! [he and Patrick sneak away, then he feels Bubble Bass' pillow for teeth] I don't feel any teeth, Patrick.
Patrick: [feeling inside Bubble Bass' mouth] Well, I feel a bunch of them. [laughs, then sees a rotten tooth] Ooh.
SpongeBob: [touching tooth] This one's really loose. I'm sure the Tooth Fairy won't mind if we help it out.
Patrick: [giggles, then hits Bubble Bass with his mallet]
Bubble Bass: [wakes up, panicked] Barnacle Boy! [Patrick lightly taps him with the mallet] Hmm. [falls back asleep with his mouth open]
[SpongeBob grabs hold of Bubble Bass' mouth as Patrick uses gloves to push out the rotten tooth. The tooth launches into the air, bouncing off of several walls as it knocks a Mermaid Man bowling ball off a shelf. The bowling ball hits Dorsal Dan directly on the head, knocking him over. SpongeBob catches the tooth.]
SpongeBob: [rummaging in sack] Ooh, is this where you keep the pillow money? [pulls out giant stack of cash] Wow, teeth are sure worth a lot these days. [puts stack of money underneath Bubble Bass' pillow and kisses him on the head]
Patrick: [grabbing Dorsal Dan by the leg] Come on, let's get more teeth. You've got the best job ever.
[Sparkle transition to the trio parking next to another house and tiptoeing into a window. A couple is sleeping in a bed in the bedroom, and SpongeBob and Patrick each emerge from lamps. They use plungers to release teeth from the couple's mouths. Dorsal Dan is tiptoeing while holding a TV when he trips on the teeth.]
Dorsal Dan: Whoa! [the TV crushes him as SpongeBob puts the teeth in the sack and takes it]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [looking at the jewels in the sack] Oh! [puts jewels behind the couple's pillows, and kiss them on their heads]
[Sparkle transition to a building called Mussel Arms. Dorsal Dan's vehicle drives up its exterior and stops at the top. They enter through a window on the top. A giant female whale is snoring in her bed as SpongeBob ties a rope around one of her teeth. The whale's snoring blows SpongeBob and Patrick away.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa! [get blown away by snoring again] Oh! [get blown away by snoring again as Dorsal Dan unlocks a trophy case] Oh!
[As Dorsal Dan licks his lips and opens the trophy case, the whale's tooth breaks free and lands in the trophy case, causing a giant crash.]
SpongeBob: [applauding] Ah. [inserts 24 karat gold bar into the whale's teeth and kisses her on the head, making her smile]
[Sparkle transition to Dorsal Dan's vehicle crashing into Lady Upturn's mansion. They all sneak into the building via its walls. While Upturn is sleeping in her bed, SpongeBob uses tools to knock one of her teeth off. SpongeBob gives the ok gesture as Patrick reels in a rope while Dorsal Dan tries to open a safe. Right, ah, oh. [opens safe and puts valuables in sack, Patrick sucks on his stethoscope, making him scream and get stuck inside the safe]
SpongeBob: [takes coins and puts them under Upturn's pillow, then kisses her head, making her flip over to the side]
[Sparkle transition to Dorsal Dan's vehicle driving on the road.]
Dorsal Dan: [cackling, fanning money] You stooges really gave the Tooth Fairy a lot of help tonight. Even if you also gave me a headache.
Patrick: [in seat] I like helping!
Dorsal Dan: [kicking feet back, then grabbing steering wheel] Well, I think we got time for one last job if you're in.
SpongeBob: [up front, pointing to Mr. Krabs' house, making Dorsal Dan stop] Hey! That's where Mr. Krabs lives. He's my daytime boss. [pokes Dorsal Dan] You're my nighttime boss. [Dorsal Dan chomps his arm off, tossing it to the side as SpongeBob regrows his arm, laughing]
[The sack is thrown into Mr. Krabs' house as SpongeBob slithers through the envelope entrance in the door. He opens the door for Dorsal Dan and Patrick to come in with their own sacks.]
SpongeBob: [getting in front of them] Wait! Watch out for booby traps. I helped Mr. Krabs install the security system myself, so--
Patrick: Here's one! [pulling rope with a neon sign that says ""PULL ME""] I'll disarm it!
SpongeBob: Patrick, no! [a giant anchor crushes Dorsal Dan]
Patrick: Oops.
Mr. Krabs: [off-screen] Hello? [turns on stair lights] Who's down there? I'm calling the police. Yes, police? Come quick! I heard a noise.
SpongeBob: [panicking] Oh, no! We woke him up! Let's get out of here.
[SpongeBob pulls on Dorsal Dan's arm, making him scream.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Shh!
Mr. Krabs: [in nightwear, rubbing eyes, coming downstairs] Wha... ah, SpongeBob, Patrick. [SpongeBob and Patrick are sweating] What in the name of Poseidon's pantaloons are you doing? Why have you tripped me burglar alarm? [shot of burglar sacks] And why do you have those burglar sacks? [shot of SpongeBob and Patrick] And why are you wearing burglar masks? [shot of Dorsal Dan under the anchor] And why are you with that burglar? Wait a minute. [gasps] Are you burglars?
Patrick: I'll take a burglar with cheese.
SpongeBob: We're not burglars. We were just assisting the [gesturing to Dorsal Dan] Tooth Fairy here.
Dorsal Dan: [weakly, waving] Hello.
Mr. Krabs: That ain't no Tooth Fairy. I should know. [holding up picture of him as a child with no teeth and two sacks of money] I sold all my teeth to the real Tooth Fairy years ago. [police sirens wailing]
Dorsal Dan: Oh, no, the fuzz! [grabbing SpongeBob's legs] You gotta get me out of here!
SpongeBob: I don't know. Mr. Krabs says you're not the real Tooth Fairy.
Dorsal Dan: Huh? Of course I am! You just, uh, uh, gotta believe! That's all, yeah.
Patrick: [tearing up] I believe in you, Tooth Fairy! [hits Dorsal Dan with his mallet, sending him flying through the front door]
SpongeBob: [carrying large sack outside] Goodbye, Mr. Krabs! [sack gets stuck in the door, Patrick hits it with his mallet]
Patrick: [winks at Mr. Krabs before leaving]
Mr. Krabs: [groans, rubbing face] Those two are so gullible. [looks at sign that says ""PULL ME""] Oh, look! This rope says ""pull me."" [pulls rope, dropping an anchor on him]
Pearl: [in nightwear holding a teddy bear, running to Mr. Krabs] Wah! [sighs, then walks away]
[Outside, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Dorsal Dan all get in their vehicle and drive off as some police cars chase them. They drive along a winding road, and they all stop right before a cliff. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Dorsal Dan all exit the vehicle.]
SpongeBob: Whoa!
Patrick: Ahh!
SpongeBob: [zoom out to reveal giant cliff] We can't go any farther!
Dorsal Dan: The jig is up! What are we gonna do?
SpongeBob: You're a Tooth Fairy! You can fly! [jazzes hands] Fly to safety!
Dorsal Dan: What?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both push Dorsal Dan off the cliff] Fly!
Dorsal Dan: [screaming as he falls down the cliff, breaking his teeth on impact]
SpongeBob: Don't forget your teeth! [tosses bag off cliff, which lands on Dorsal Dan]
Patrick: Or your boat! [tosses vehicle off cliff, causing an explosion when it lands]
Dorsal Dan: [screams off-screen]
SpongeBob: [looking down] You know, Patrick, I get the feeling that wasn't the real Tooth Fairy.
Tooth Fairy: [laughs, floating above] Of course not! But I am!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [gasp] The real Tooth Fairy?
Tooth Fairy: You two did a wonderful job collecting teeth all night. Therefore, I'm going to make you honorary Tooth Fairy assistants. Abraca-- [rubs SpongeBob and Patrick with toothbrush] Dental.
SpongeBob: Ooh! [he and Patrick start glowing]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [looking at their new wings] Huh? [babble excitedly, then fly upwards]
[They both fly in the air and blow away the smoke from the explosion from earlier, also making Dorsal Dan glow, who is still injured.]
Patrick: [picks up tooth] A tooth!
SpongeBob: [enlarges quarter] And a quarter. [quarter lands on Dorsal Dan]
Dorsal Dan: [groans as he tries to grab the quarter, which crushes him]

SpongeBob receives the call from his parents at his house and realizes that they haven’t visited him in a while, so he thinks that he needs to mature himself to thoroughly prepare for their visit.SpongeBob cleans his house as part of the preparation, with Patrick randomly appearing every time. When his parents arrive, SpongeBob maturely greets them and lets them come inside the house. SpongeBob's parents soon arrive, ready to hang out with him for his youthful nature, but soon find him acting mature. SpongeBob gives his parents an agenda of ""adult"" activities to do for the day.

[Harold is reading a newspaper and Margaret is knitting.]
Margaret: [sniffs] Harold, do you smell that? It smells like something... rotting.
[Avocado goop falls on Harold's head. He wipes it off his glasses.]
Harold: [groans] It's begun. [grabs Margaret] We better run!
[He carries her outside as the house rots. An old fish rides by on a motor scooter.]
Harold and Margaret: Oh...
Old fish: I tell people the rub their homes with lemon juice and wrap it in plastic! But do they listen?
Margaret: Oh, Harold, what will we do?
Harold: Well, we'll just have to grow a new home. [takes a giant avocado seed] And in the meantime, we can stay with our son.

Gary: Meow.

SpongeBob: [answers phone] Hello? [indistinct gibberish] Oh, hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Your house? Oh, no. Stay with me? Why, of course you can! [hangs up] Ooh, guess what, Gary. Mom and Dad are coming over to stay at our place for the very first time! [smiles]
Gary: Meow.

SpongeBob: [hands them papers] I have taken the liberty of writing up an agenda of activities that I know all of us adults will find most stimulating.
[SpongeBob puts on some spectacles and pulls up a podium. Unable to see over the podium, he grabs a stepstool and gets on it. He brings in a chalkboard with a drawing of Conch Street and sips a cup of tea.]
SpongeBob: [points to houses] We'll begin with a leisurely walk about the neighborhood so we can critique other people's lawns. After that-- [spins the board to show SpongeBob and his parents talking, with speech bubbles reading ""Politics"", ""Taxes"", ""Everything is Bad""] conversations about [points to words] taxes, politics, and how things aren't nearly as good as they used to be, [Harold and Margaret are confused] then an early-bird dinner, and we'll top it off with bedtime at 4:00 p.m.
Harold: But son, this isn't--
Margaret: [shoves her paper in his mouth] Whatever you say, son. We're your guests.
French Narrator: [narrating time card reading ""4 PM""] 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
[Harold and Margaret lay awake in SpongeBob's bed. SpongeBob sets out some Goofy Goober mugs of milk and turns a radio on.]
SpongeBob: Some warm milk and the soothing sounds of disapproval to whisk you off to your slumbers.
Recorded Voice: [stilted] Tsk-tsk. Mm-mm-mm-mm. You are so grounded.
[Squidward's clarinet playing is heard outside. SpongeBob opens his window and yells at him.]
SpongeBob: Will you puh-lease stop that con-founded racket!? Some grown-ups are trying to sleep in here! [shuts window]
Squidward: [scared] Sorry, sir! [confused] What? [angry] Wait a minute.
[SpongeBob sleeps on the couch, and Gary sleeps on a chair. Fish are seen walking their snails outside.]
SpongeBob: Good night, my dear gastropod.
[Gary meows and spins around in bed but meows again angrily. Cut back to Harold and Margaret in bed.]
Harold: Margaret, dear, I'm afraid our son has become, well, a fuddy duddy. [adjusts glasses] Pardon my language.
Margaret: Well, I was gonna say ""bummer, a downer, and a total drag.""
Harold: What do you say we sneak out and have some fun?
Margaret: [already climbing out the window] Way ahead of ya!
[Harold smiles and gets out of bed. They climb down a ladder, run outside, and drive off. That night, they drive back and stumble out of the car. Harold wears a lampshade. They dance on the car, and Harold falls off. They enter the house, laughing, when SpongeBob catches them. He is wearing his nightclothes and has visible stubble.]
[Harold and Margaret gasp.]
SpongeBob: Where have you two been? It is 8 o'clock at night. I was worried sick.
Margaret: We were just having a little fun.
[Harold puts his hat back on.]
SpongeBob: You're both acting like children. [takes hat off and stands up, crosses arms]
Harold: [points] And you're acting like a square!
SpongeBob: [gasps] I [face morphs to be square] am square, and I've already committed to acting mature, whether you like it or not.
Margaret: Okay, Mr. Mature, it's time for you to have some fun, whether you like it or not!
Harold: It's Bikini Bottom after dark, baby! [pauses] It's gonna be wild. [record scratching, gestures at camera] Woot, woot!
[Cut to SpongeBob and his parents in the car. As Harold steps on the gas, they drive to Squidward's house. Margaret giggles and throws a roll of toilet paper on it.]
Harold: Go on, son. Join her.
SpongeBob: Hmph.
Harold: That is an order, son! [points]
SpongeBob: [scared] Oh, okay!
[SpongeBob nervously leaves.]
Harold: [leans back] I still got it.
Margaret: [holding toilet paper] Come on, killjoy. Don't be such a party pooper. [gives him toilet paper and backs away, chants] Do it! Do it!
SpongeBob: [sighs] [posh accent] This is so childish.
Squidward: [opens door] What is going--
[SpongeBob accidentally throws the toilet paper in Squidward's face.]
Squidward: SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob screams and runs away. He gets in the car and his parents drive away. A roll of toilet paper on the house falls and hits Squidward on the head. They drive up to a wrestling center.]
Margaret: Yahoo! Masked luchador wrestling!
SpongeBob: [blows raspberry] How juvenile.
[SpongeBob sits in the stands, between his parents.]
SpongeBob: Well, I guess this is all right. It shouldn't be too wild, just sitting here, watching.
Harold: [gives him the peanut bag] Uh, we're not here to watch.
Margaret: [stands up] We're here to wrestle.
Wrestling Announcer: It's tag team time! [buzzer sounds] Los Diablos vs. Madre y Padre!
[Harold and Margaret put on wrestling uniforms and jump into the ring. SpongeBob is worried.]
SpongeBob: Mommy, Daddy, no!
[The opening bell rings, and wrestlers pound their fists together. Margaret does stretches. Harold runs in place, winds up a punch, and runs. The wrestler bounces him into the ground. Margaret tags him and gets tripped by another wrestler. She bounces off the ropes and into Harold. One Diablo grab Harold and play him like an accordion, and the other spins Margaret around and smashes her into the floor. SpongeBob tries to eat peanuts but reaches his hand through the bag and chews on his hand. One Diablo kicks Harold into the air and another bounces Margaret into the ropes. SpongeBob chews the bag and rocks back and forth in his seat. Los Diablos run into each other and smash Harold and Margaret together.]
SpongeBob: Mom, Dad! I'm coming! [puts the bag over his head and jumps into the ring, only to see everything empty] Uh, Mom? Dad?
[Harold and Margaret are in the stands, cheering him on.]
Harold: 'Atta boy, SpongeBob!
Margaret: We're rooting for you, kiddo!
Wrestling Announcer: For our next bout, it's El Muerte vs. Señor Peanuts Bag!
SpongeBob: Oh, wait, what?
[Pounding footsteps are heard. A wrestler in a skeleton outfit roars and pounds the ground, then runs forward.]
SpongeBob: [screams like a woman] Whoa! [screams in regular and gets chased around] Mommy, Daddy!
[El Muerte stops and catches SpongeBob as he runs around, making him spin. El Muerte stomps on Patrick and bends his legs.]
SpongeBob: No más! No más! [gets grabbed by Harold] Yay! Whoa!
Harold: Now, wasn't that fun?
[An injured SpongeBob walks off. Harold, Margaret, and SpongeBob drive away.]
Margaret: Whoo-hoo!
[El Muerte gets up and takes his helmet off, revealing him to be Patrick.]
Patrick: [grunts] Where'd that peanut bag guy go? [stomach grumbles] I'm hungry.
[A hot dog-themed wrestler approaches Patrick.]
Hot Dog Wrestler: How 'bout a hot dog?
[Cut to the outside of a roller rink.]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] I never even knew there was a 24-hour roller rink in Bikini Bottom. [as everyone skates inside, SpongeBob and his parents have roller skates on] Well, I guess skating slowly around and around a roller rink isn't so wild.
Margaret: Rink? We're skating through town. [she and Harold jump away]
Harold: Ha-ha!
Margaret: Whoo!
[A fish is sent flying from the impact.]
Harold: Whoops, excuse me!
[Harold and Margaret skate out of the roller rink. SpongeBob follows them on skates.]
SpongeBob: Hey!
[Harold and Margaret skate past a garbage can, knocking it over, and scare an alley snail away.]
SpongeBob: Will you two please act your age?
[In a hotel, the elevator opens and Harold and Margaret skate out. Margaret rings the bell. A doorman reaches for pay, but SpongeBob comes out and knocks him over.]
SpongeBob: Please stop!
[Lady Upturn and a rich man appear in the elevator and see the doorman knocked out. The rich man shuts the elevator again. Harold and Margaret skate in the hospital, pushing two senior citizens in wheelchairs.]
Harold and Margaret: Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: [riding on a hospitalized patient] Will you slow down? This is crazy!
[They go on a roller coaster at Glove World, through the ocean.]
SpongeBob: [exhausted] Please, I beg you...
[As Squidward is still cleaning up the toilet paper, Harold and Margaret skate back home, laughing. SpongeBob follows them, panting heavily. Harold and Margaret land on the couch. SpongeBob struggles to stop his skates and faceplants.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I just wanted to impress you two by showing you what a mature adult I've become. But no, you wanted wild. Okay, fine! [pulls pants up] You want wild? [screaming] I'll show you! [pulls off his skin to reveal his stuntman uniform] Wild!
[SpongeBob repeatedly bounces up and down. Gary goes next to Margaret, who pets him. SpongeBob launches the soda bottles and flies around, knocking over furniture and putting holes in the house. After a burst of smoke, the house is completely destroyed. The door falls off, showing Harold, Margaret, and Gary hiding behind the couch. Empty soda bottles fall from the sky. SpongeBob, asleep, gently falls down. Harold and Margaret catch him.]
Harold: Aw, the boy's asleep, all tuckered out. [checks clock] Well, our new avocondo should be ripe right now. He'll have to stay with us until he can regrow his pineapple.
Margaret: [carrying Gary, skating away with him] I wonder when he'll really grow up and be mature.
Harold: Hopefully not too soon. Am I right, dear?
[Patrick, still in his wrestling outfit, runs up with a hot dog.]
Patrick: [panting] Señor Peanuts Bag! I want satisfaction! [pauses] Or peanuts... [iris out pauses on him] But rather peanuts. [iris out continues]",0.21,Kaz

Mr. Krabs sets up a crowd of watchers for some extra money after Incidental 45 wanted to watch the royal family eat through the window, and SpongeBob cooks 5,000 Krabby Patties for King Neptune just as he arrives.However, King Neptune is overly depressed about his son, Triton, when SpongeBob mentions him. Neptune shows everyone a movie that he made about his sad separation with Triton, locking him in a cage in the Island in the Sky until he learns to become a proper god like his father. To ease King Neptune's pain, SpongeBob plans to go to the Island in the Sky and release Triton from his shrunken cage. Unfortunately, the lock on the cage was impossible for SpongeBob to undo. So, he then asks Patrick to unlock it and succeeds.Triton comes out and offers the two a ""ride"" after turning the cage into a car, which SpongeBob and Patrick accept. But Triton pulls over when they were halfway there and tells SpongeBob and Patrick he does not need them anymore, knocking them out of the car with one whip of his tail. He immediately goes to Bikini Bottom and destroys it to have revenge on his father for locking him up. Then SpongeBob and Patrick return to Bikini Bottom and see the destruction. They both realize this was the reason Triton was locked up. They sneak into the Krusty Krab using the secret entrance, which led to inside the grill. SpongeBob tells Patrick to be very quiet.Patrick agrees, but unfortunately throws the top of the grill backward, making a loud clashing noise. The two peek from behind the cashier window and see that Triton has locked up Neptune and all the party goers in a cage. King Neptune apologizes to Triton and begs him to release everybody else and take him instead, but he ignores him. Then SpongeBob and Patrick unlock the cage staying hidden in the grill. Triton, in great dismay, says to his father that he was only kidding and tries to swim away. But an angry Neptune catches him by appearing in front of him. Triton tries to tell him that he did not mean to lock him in a cage, but his father thinks he has gone too far and is about to punish Triton for his actions.Neptune then sees what Triton did to Bikini Bottom and angrily asks him if he was responsible for it. Triton begs Neptune not to send him back to the cage. But Neptune, instead of punishing him, says that he just gave him the best birthday present he has ever received. Triton learned to use his powers at long last, and that was what Neptune wanted all along. Neptune finally accepts Triton for who he is and the two hug with everyone cheering for them. Then, with Amphitrite, they return home. As they leave, Neptune says this was the best birthday he ever had, and it was all because of SpongeBob. SpongeBob was very happy with himself, but everybody hears what he said and begin to form an angry mob. The episode ends with SpongeBob and Patrick running as the angry mob of citizens of Bikini Bottom chase them and Mr. Krabs watches.",The Clash of Triton,"[King Neptune is seen lying in bed]
Amphitrite: Oh, Neptune, surely this isn't the behavior befitting a king, hiding in bed for days on end, doing nothing but watching daytime television. [turns off TV]
King Neptune: Wait! Rochelle was just about to meet her biological parents!
Amphitrite: Is this about turning 5,000 today?
King Neptune: No. Oh, my darling Amphitrite, it is not my age that troubles me so. It's that our son, Triton, will not be able to share in my revelry.
Amphitrite: Let's forget about Triton for just one day. It's your 5,000th birthday, for shell's sake.
King Neptune: [sighs] Okay. So long as there's no one careless enough to mention Triton.
[cuts to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Order up Squidward! [gives Squidward a Krabby Patty using his nose] I'll bet you're wondering why I'm not using my hands today.
Squidward: [takes Krabby Patty] Not in the least, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Okay, okay, I'll tell you.
Squidward: [walks up to table with strange looking fish] Your order, ma'am.
[the strange fish is really SpongeBob in a costume]
SpongeBob: I'm not using my hands because today is ""Work Without Your Hands Day."" [jumps out of costume] You should give it a whirl, buddy. [enters the kitchen and hears phone ring. Takes off one of his shoes and socks and picks up phone with his now bare foot.] Krusty Krab, SpongeBob speaking. Just a minute please. Mr. Krabs, it's a Queen Amphitrite. She wants to have King Neptune's birthday party here.
Mr. Krabs: [sarcastically] Oh she does, does she? I'll handle this, laddie. [takes phone from SpongeBob] Yes, Queen Amphitrite. [pauses to listen to Queen Amphitrite] Very convincing, but you're gonna have to call pretty early to fool ol' Eugene Krabs, prankster! [blocks phone with claw] . They think I was born yesterday. Aye-aye-aye. [Queen Amphitrite breaks through the roof and zaps Mr. Krabs] Does 7:00 work for you, your majesty? [Turns to SpongeBob] Oil up yer spatula boy, for tonight you fry for a king.
SpongeBob: So much for ""Work Without Your Hands Day,"" SquarePants. You answer to a higher calling this day. I have the capability! [Raises up spatula and light flashes on spatula. Then SpongeBob turns to Patrick who is standing in the corner] Okay, that's enough Patrick, thank you.
[Reveals Patrick with a flashlight and a wobble board]
[Outside the kitchen, the decorations and gifts are all set for King Neptune's birthday]
Mr. Krabs: You two really outdid yourselves. It almost makes me want to pay you. [chuckling] Oh, yeah. [passes pole with ribbons and two balloons] Looks like this area could use a few more decorations. Squidward!
Squidward: Now, what?
Mr. Krabs: The decorations over here look a little sparse. Why don't you hang up a few balloons or something? [walks away]
[Squidward stands motionless]
Mr. Krabs: [walks back] Oh, that's better. Looks lovely, Squidward. Excellent work. How goes it over here?
SpongeBob: All set, Mr. K. 5,000 patties, one for every year Neptune's been alive.
Mr. Krabs: 5,000 patties at $3.99 a pop? [babbles nonsensically due to how much money he'll get]
[Outside the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Leave it to your old boss here to capitalize on such a momentous occasion. [rolls out red carpet]
Shubie: Wow! Why, you rolled out the red carpet!
Mr. Krabs: This ain't for you, lad. This is for King Neptune. Today is his birthday.
Shubie: Oh, uh, wait, King Neptune is coming here? Oh, I am a huge fan of the royal family. I just love everything they do. Could we please, maybe, watch them eat, right here through the window, you know?
Mr. Krabs: Don't be ridiculous. Why in Neptune's name would I let you... [thought bubble of Mr. Krabs bangs him in between the eyes with a money gavel]
Mr. Krabs: [later on] See Neptune eat! Only five dollars! Only a few seats left!
[Fred gives him a five dollar bill]
Mr. Krabs: Thank you.
[Debbie gives him a five dollar bill]
Mr. Krabs: Thank you.
[Fish gives Mr. Krabs a twenty dollar bill]
Fish #19: You got change for a twenty?
Mr. Krabs: Nope, sorry. I guess that it's twenty dollars for for you then. Don't be shy folks. Seats are going fast.
[thunder is heard]
[fish gasp as a carrier holding King Neptune, Queen Amphitrite, and monsters assisting Neptune arrive at the Krusty Krab]
King Neptune: Greetings, my obedient flock.
[the crowd cheers and talks]
King Neptune: [to Amphitrite] You were right, honey. Hearing these mortals cheer for me has made me feel better already.
SpongeBob: Excuse me, Mr. Royal Sea Kingness, your table is this way, sir.
[inside the Krusty Krab]
King Neptune: Oh, these seats are surprisingly comfortable for being long-lord and primitive storage vessels.
Amphitrite: Oh, husband, I'm so glad to see that you're enjoying your birthday party.
King Neptune: And I am glad that you are glad, dear.
Amphitrite: And I'm glad that you're glad that I'm glad, my king.
King Neptune: And I'm glad that you're glad that I'm glad that you're glad...
Monsters: Alright already!
King Neptune: And methinks I shall continue to enjoy us all as long as there's no mention of the name...
SpongeBob: Triton, Triton, Triton? Is there a Triton here? Is there anybody missing from this party that any of you guys can see?
Amphitrite: Nope, there's nobody missing, we're all here.
[Monsters from the Party start to get nervous]
SpongeBob: Oh, I was sure there's somebody.. [sees an empty seat] Oh! Here it is, right here! An empty seat!
King Neptune: That's not an empty seat. My wife is sitting there.
SpongeBob: [laughs] No, not that chair, your Highness, that one! See? It even has its pretty name card that I made still on it.
King Neptune: Oh no.
SpongeBob: T-R-I-T-O-N. You sure you don't know anyone named Triton? [Neptune sobs] Should I put it down yes or no?
Amphitrite: Triton is our son. But as you can see, the king doesn't want to talk about it right now.
King Neptune: Thank you, my darling. I'd rather not share with this addled mortal the woeful story of our son, Triton. [all agree] But I suppose I could tell it. [all disagree] No, you're right, I won't tell it. [all breathe a sigh of relief, pulls out a projector] Instead, I'm going to show this movie I made about it. [all groan] Could someone please dim the lights? [lights are dimmed]
[The projector shows a flashback with King Neptune and Triton. Scene starts in King Neptune's palace]
King Neptune: [narrating] It all started one day while giving Triton his smiting lessons.
[King Neptune uses his trident to zap a smaller version of Bikini Bottom. The city bursts into flames]
King Neptune: That's how you strike fear into the hearts of your subjects! Now you try, son. Son?
King Neptune: [narrating] Triton was increasingly fascinated with the miserable world of the lowly mortals.
[Young Triton is seen watching a baseball game from the edge of the palace]
Triton: Dad, when are you going to teach me the ball and stick game?
King Neptune: Never. Now take hold of your trident and practice your smiting, son.
Triton: I don't feel like smiting. I wanna play the ball and stick game.
King Neptune: Okay, son, you want to learn the stick and ball game? Well here's your first lesson. Batter up. [The trident zaps one of the stadium's lights. Everyone in the baseball field starts screaming] It looks like I just hit a single. Let's see if you can get a home run, son.
Triton: Leave me alone, Dad. [swims back home]
King Neptune: [narrating] What was happening to my own flesh and blood? Over the next few millennia, my son grew not only in size, but in perplexing behavior.
[A explosion is heard from Triton's door, and green smoke seeps out. Neptune opens it and sees Triton with beakers of chemicals]
King Neptune: What is going on in here?
Triton: Hey, Dad, check it out! I'm studying chemistry, and I've just created a cure for all mortal diseases!
King Neptune: [pushes all the beakers out of the table angrily, then grabs Triton by his arms] How many times do I have to tell you? We are gods! We don't have diseases, nor do we care whether or not the mortals contract them!
Triton: Gosh! [moves away]
King Neptune: [to the camera] Try as I might, it was becoming increasingly apparent that we would not agree on the ways of the world. I knew I had no choice. There was only one last resort. [shows video of people dancing on a beach] No, not that one! The Island in the Sky.
Triton: Isn't that island a miniature golf course?
King Neptune: No! The one on the other side of the river
Triton: You mean the juvenile correction facility? But that place is for losers, man.
King Neptune: Uh-huh.
[One the island in the sky]
Triton: Okay, I'm standing in here. Now what? [Neptune locks Triton up in a cage] What are you doing? This is bogus!
King Neptune: I'm sealing you inside this magical shrinking cage until you learn to embrace your destiny as one of the gods!
[Neptune zaps the cage]
Triton: Noooooo!
[cage only shrinks a little]
Triton: You call that shrinking?
King Neptune: Well, it only shrinks 7%.
Triton: Man, that is just beyond bogus.
King Neptune: Perhaps in your eyes, it is beyond bogus, but it is the only way you'll learn. [Pulls rope to hang the cage up a tree] Reflect on this for 10,000 years.
Triton: You can't do this, man! I've got a life to live. I can't be stuck in this cage, man! [Neptune leaves the island] God. I hate you, old man, you hear me? I hate you! [echoes]
[flashback ends]
King Neptune: And that's that.
[everyone inside the Krusty Krab is sleeping]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? Okay, who's ready for a piping hot Krabby Patty? Would you like the first one, your highness?
King Neptune: Recounting this sad tale has upset me so much, I've lost my appetite. [sobs]
Amphitrite: Take those sandwiches away! Can't you see the king is upset? [turns to Neptune] It's okay, let it out.
[cuts to the outside of the Krusty Krab]
Male fish: This is a rip-off! I paid to watch high-class royal dining action, not listen to a boring sob story.
Monica: Ooh, looks like things may be picking up! Royal violence!
Amphitrite: Why have you not obeyed me, mortal? Be gone!
Mr. Krabs: So who's going to pay for these, then?
[Amphitrite zaps Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Oh! If Neptune doesn't cheer up soon, me business is ruined.
SpongeBob: Oh no. This is all my fault because I mentioned [whispers] Triton.
Squidward: Well, it wouldn't be the first time you've ruined everything, but the worst part is those 5,000 Krabby Patties that will end up going rotten in the hot sun.
SpongeBob: Stop, Squidward, please stop! Your descriptions are too horrifying for my delicate sensibilities.
Squidward: I do have a way with words.
King Neptune: Oh, how I miss my son! [sobbing]
SpongeBob: Hey, that's it! I'll fix all this by reuniting Neptune with his son! ""[runs off, screen goes to black]""
[scene cuts to island in the sky]
[bus appears with SpongeBob aboard. SpongeBob appears on the edge of the island as bus leaves]
SpongeBob: [waving] Thanks again, Mr. Bus Driver!
SpongeBob: [turning to island] Now, all I've got to do is find King Neptune's long-lost son.
[SpongeBob disappears into island]
[scene cuts back to Krusty Krab. Neptune is seen crying]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, Krabs! Think, think! [suddenly gets idea] Ooh! [turns to Squidward]
Squidward: Whatever it is, no.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, you're a man of culture.
Squidward: Go on.
Mr. Krabs: Well, these highfalutin' types, they might appreciate that, don't you think? Why don't you try and razzle-dazzle them with all your pizazz?
Squidward: Pizazz. Hold on to your hats and glasses, people, because Squidward the Fantabulous has arrived.
[scene cuts to the audience outside, then cuts back to Squidward with his clarinet]
Squidward: Thank you. Thank you. This next one, I wrote myself. I like to call it, 'Three Barnacles are a Crowd Unless They've Known Each Other for a Really Long Time.' [clarinet music plays]
Frank: Things just got lame again.
Monica: Yeah, well, they better get un-lame real quick, or I'm asking for my money back.
[Mr. Krabs comes out, sticks a 'No Refunds' sign on the ground in front of the audience, and goes back inside]
Frank: No refunds!? Well, I guess we're stuck here, then.
[scene cuts to island in the sky. SpongeBob is seen sleeping]
[fingernail drops on SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob awakes.]
SpongeBob: What the—I had the strangest dream that I just got hit in the head with a tiny toenail clipping.
[another fingernail drops on SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: [looks down and picks up fingernail] Hey, I was right! It is a tiny toenail clipping.
[another fingernail drops on SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Another one! [sees rope] Plus some rope. [lowers cage with Triton inside]
[Triton is seen on the ground in the cage looking away]
Triton: Hey, man, what's the big idea?
SpongeBob: [doesn't know Triton was talking, nor does he see him] Who said that? Show yourself! I'm warning you. I know how to use these! [makes karate noises and karate moves]
Triton: [turns to SpongeBob] I'm down here, man!
[SpongeBob looks down and sees Triton]
SpongeBob: Oh, hello, little fella. Maybe you can help me. Because if I don't find Triton soon, Krabs is gonna be real upset, because he spent a lot of money on party decorations.
Triton: Party decorations? For what?
SpongeBob: For King Neptune's birthday!
Triton: So, it's my old man's birthday. Big deal.
SpongeBob: [gasps] You mean, you're King Neptune's son?
Triton: I am, but he doesn't seem to think so.
SpongeBob: Well, he sure seemed upset that you weren't at his birthday party.
Triton: Hah! That's a real good one, man. Real funny.
SpongeBob: [laughs a little] Well, thanks, but...
Triton: Do you think if that old goat really cared, he'd have me sealed up in this magical cage with nothing to do all day [holds up a pair of nail clippers] but trim my fingernails, man?
SpongeBob: You're right. It just doesn't make any sense.
Triton: You're telling me, man.
SpongeBob: I mean, gods shouldn't have to use nail clippers. They should be able to wear their fingernails to whatever length they want!
Triton: Man, you're just like all the rest. [turns away]
SpongeBob: Don't go.
[Triton ignores and starts trimming his fingernails]
[SpongeBob presses his face against the bars of the cage in front of Triton with a hideous look]
SpongeBob: What if there was a way to free you from this magical cage? Then, you could come to your father's birthday party and settle your differences!
Triton: May I ask you to brush your teeth first, dude? P.U.!
SpongeBob: Sorry, I haven't had anything to drink in a couple of days, my throat's a little dry.
Triton: [coughs] This cage is only so big, man.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, I'll stop talking, I swear
Triton: Never mind, just undo the lock
SpongeBob: [looks at lock] boy this really does look complicated, oh I see, I'll just slide this square to the right, this one goes up, one other here and ohh wait, no, ahh, no. [squares start circling his face and he screams] Man, that really is a tough nut to crack.
Triton: That lock was forged by the gods, not any numbskull can open like a cheap bag of potato chips they found in the street.
SpongeBob: Cheap bag of potato c- wait a minute, which way to the nearest phone booth?

[the bus is seen again dropping Patrick off on the Island]
SpongeBob: Oh Patrick, you made it, this is the magical lock I was talking about. [holds up lock]
Patrick: Hmm...
SpongeBob: Yeah, I tried for hours and hours but I just can't get it to...
Patrick: [undoes the lock] Open!
SpongeBob: Wow, already? Patrick you know I'll never figure out how you do those so darn fast.
Patrick: It's easy. I just peel the stickers of the squares and put them back on where there supposed to.
SpongeBob: Amazing!
Triton: Well, now this silly old cage is open, why don't we go pay my old man a visit. Hate to keep him waiting on his birthday. [Triton flies up and turns the cage into a sports car and hops in] you guys coming or what?
SpongeBob: Wow!
Patrick: Are you going to take us for a ride?
Triton: A ride, that's a great idea

Patrick: What an interesting man.
[cuts to Neptune's party]
Mr. Krabs: Ready for a room temperature Krabby Patty yet?
King Neptune: Nope
[Mr. Krabs sulks and hits into the cashier boat]
Squidward: Careful, this is made out of imported wood, imported all they way from the junk pile out the back.
Mr. Krabs: Neptune is inconsolable, if only there where something to distract him from his pain.
Squidward: The only thing that can usually do that is something that causes more pain.
Mr. Krabs: Great idea, go and play them another song.
[cuts to where Squidward is about to play his clarinet]
King Neptune: [to Amphitrite] He's back
Amphitrite: Oh, how...nice?
Squidward: If pleases the king, I would like to perform a...

Mr. Krabs: [whispers to Squidward] What he say?
Squidward: I think he wants us to look at the- Oh my!
[Triton and his car smash through the window and the crowd cheers]
Frank: That was incredible!
Monica: Yeah, definitely worth the five bucks.
King Neptune: Son?!
[Triton zaps everyone and locks them in a cage]
King Neptune: Son, I demand to know the meaning of this impudent imprisonment.
Triton: Well it turns out you where right old man, being trapped in that cage all those years with nowhere to go but up here made me realize something, dabbling in the world of mere mortals is totally lame.
King Neptune: And this is how you intend to show it.
Triton: No man, this is how! [flies through the roof] Hahaha!
King Neptune: By flying through the roof?
Monica: That was Triton, Neptune's son!
Frank: I thought he was in reform school or something.
[the Bikini Bottomites cheer on Triton]
Purple Fish: Can I have an autograph?
Triton: Sure you can.

SpongeBob: [gasps] the Krusty Krab!
[cuts to the outside of the Krusty Krab]
Patrick: It's still standing.
SpongeBob: But look, that mail hasn't been picked up today. [shows letters in front of the Krusty Krab]
Patrick: Right
SpongeBob: We better use the secret entrance.
[SpongeBob and Patrick appear in the stove]
SpongeBob: Be very very quiet.
Patrick: Gotcha pal. [throws stove top causing a chain reaction of loud noises] What?
[SpongeBob and Patrick look through the cabin window and see Triton eating the Krabby Patties]
Mr. Krabs: Please! I'll be ruined!
King Neptune: Don't worry Mr. Krabs, no one was going to pay for them anyway. [this causes Mr. Krabs to cry]
SpongeBob: Oh, this is terrible.
Patrick: Tell me about it, I never get free food here.
King Neptune: Son, hear my words, I can understand if you want to keep me locked up in this cage and set me, but see it in your heart to release these others as they are innocent. Well, maybe not all of them. [looks at the small purple guy]
Triton: Sorry old man, you lost me up in the hear in my words part.
Patrick: He's unstoppable.
SpongeBob: Only as long as King Neptune is locked up.
Patrick: You thinking what I'm thinking?
SpongeBob: Yeah, Triple Gooberberry Sundays tonight after we free them.
Patrick: Ah no, but I like your idea better!
SpongeBob: Make ready the disguise.
[SpongeBob and Patrick hide in the stove and hop over to where Triton is]
Triton: [doesn't notice the stove] Hehe.
SpongeBob: Okay, now! [SpongeBob shuffle the stove next to the stage without Triton noticing them]
King Neptune: Please, no more!
SpongeBob: Quick Patrick, unlock it before he sees us
Patrick: You got it. [Patrick reaches for the lock] SpongeBob, scooch back a little. [to the purple guy] Excuse me. Okay got it.
SpongeBob: Better hurry up Patrick, he's getting bored.
Patrick: Don't rush me! Okay got it!

Triton: Hehe, I was just kidding man. [flies off. Looks back and thinks he's escaped until Neptune flies in front of him] No No, please, I-I-I never meant to...
King Neptune: Son I have tried all my life to be gentle, but this time you have.. [looks behind him and notices the destroyed Bikini Bottom] Are you responsible for all this destruction!?
Triton: Don't send me back to the cage man, I-I-I...
King Neptune: The cage? Why, son, you've just given me the best 5000th birthday present I've ever received! You've finally learned to use your god powers. Now I know when my reign comes to a close, I'll have a worthy successor and that's all I could really hope for as a king [sobs] and as your father, come here you. [they hug]
Triton: Aww dad, I love you man. [light shines on them]
[Everyone cheers and whistles and celebrates]
King Neptune: Now let's go home son. [they enter the carriage]
Amphitrite: Too do loo.
[Everyone continues cheering. The carriage flies away]
Mr. Krabs: Neptune and friends wait! What about the party? What about me restaurant?
King Neptune: [from the carriage] Oh, yes. Many thanks whoever you are. It was the best day I could of ever hoped for, and it's all because of your little boy there. None of this would've happened if it wasn't for his actions! [carriage disappears]
SpongeBob: Did you hear that, Neptune said this was all because of me.
Patrick: Well SpongeBob that's...
Sadie: Did you hear that, Neptune said this was all because of that guy!
[Citizens with torches, pitchforks, splinters, and other weapons form a mob with the damaged city in the background.]
Policeman: He did, did he?!
Patrick: Ahh, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Yes Patrick?
Patrick: Do you think now's a good time to get those Triple Gooberberry Sundaes you where talking about?
SpongeBob: I think now would be an excellent time.

Sandy: [holding pancakes with fork, giving them to SpongeBob] Ah.
SpongeBob: Aha, mm. [sticks fork into pancakes and eats them like a vacuum] These pancakes are delicious, Sandy. But [points to maple syrup jar] what do you call this sweet stuff?
Sandy: That's maple syrup. [pulls down slide of tree with a bucket on it] It's kinda like jelly that comes from trees.
Patrick: [eating pancakes] Tree jelly? Gross. I prefer mine on tap. [squirts jellyfish jelly from a nearby jellyfish onto his pancakes]
Squidward: [gets stung by the jellyfish] Oww!
Sandy: Welcome to Bikini Bottom's very first Arbor Day celebration!
Patrick: [holding pancakes] Barber Day?
SpongeBob: [with facial hair and hair on head, combing it] Well, I could use a trim.
Mr. Krabs: I think she said Harbor Day, [reveals anchor tattoos on chest] to celebrate old Navy swabs like meself!
Sandy: It's Ar-bor Day! It's a day to celebrate the joy of trees.
SpongeBob: But, Sandy, you've got the only tree in town.
Sandy: Correction, I used to have the only tree, [pulls stick lever to reveal several plant pots] but today, you're all gonna grow your own tree. [tosses pots to everyone]
All: Ah. Ooh.
Squidward: Trees don't grow underwater.
Sandy: [holding acorn basket] Oh, these little fellers will. [bangs picnic table, which flips over to reveal a lab machine where she pours in the acorns] I've used the power of science to make special acorns that will grow into saltwater trees. [machine shoots special acorns into everyone's pots]
SpongeBob: [tree grows] Oh, aww. Hellow, little tree.
Mr. Krabs: There you go. [tree grows] Ooh, look at that.
Mrs. Puff: Oh. [puts seed into pot, tree grows, laughs]
Squidward: [puts seed into pot, tree grows] Oh!
Patrick: [tosses pot, eats seed] Mmm. [tree grows inside his mouth]
Sandy: [pulling tree out of Patrick's mouth] You don't need to chew it, you whittle stick! [puts tree into pot and gives it back to Patrick, clears throat] To keep your tree healthy, all you need to do is give it lots of fertilizer.
Patrick: [farts] Not a problem.
Sandy: One more thing, to grow a happy, well-rounded tree, you need to talk to 'em.
SpongeBob: Hi, I'm SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, little feller.
Squidward: Hello.
Patrick: Testing, testing.
[Bubble transition to Mrs. Puff buckling her tree into her boat, putting a helmet on it.]
Mrs. Puff: [humming] I love talking to someone who knows how to keep a secret. [starts driving, laughs] I can finally tell someone what really happened when I pulled that job in Shell City.
[Mr. Krabs sets his tree down onto a barrel at the Krusty Krab.]

Bubble Bass: [holding patty, clears throat] Excuse me. I would like to speek to the proprietor.
Mr. Krabs: [hangs ""COMPLAINTS"" sign onto tree, pointing to it] The complaint department's over there. Talk to the tree. [laughs, walks away]
Bubble Bass: Mr. Tree, the condiment distribution of my patty is subpar.
[At Squidward's house, he has his tree set on a dresser.]

[SpongeBob is tucking his tree into his bed.]
SpongeBob: Who's a cutesy wittle tree? [pokes tree] You are! [tucks tree in his bed] Would you like to hear a bedtime story? [grabs wooden book, reading] Once upon a fertilizer, there was a mama tree, a baby tree, and a papa tree who went out to the forest, when they suddenly met little Goldy Lumberjack.
SpongeBob's tree: Ugh, what a dumb story. Would you put a sock in it? I'm trying to get some shut-eye.
SpongeBob: You can talk? [hugs tree] I'm gonna name you Barky.
Barky: [shoves SpongeBob] Let go already. You're wrinkling my leaves, you filter feeding freak.
French Narrator: [narrating time card] A little while later...
[In Sandy's treedome, her phone rings. Sandy answers it, and a split-screen of her and SpongeBob appears.]
SpongeBob: Hello, Sandy?
Sandy: Oh, howdy, SpongeBob. How's your new tree dong? Are you talking to it?
SpongeBob: I'm trying, but to be honest, I really haven't been able to get a word in edgewise. My tree's been doing all the talking.
Sandy: [Barky taps on SpongeBob] Are you feeling okay, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Hang on. Barky wants to talk to you. [puts Barky on phone]
Barky: Why did you leave me with this giggling hunk o' holes? He's dimmer than a half-watt bulb in a power outage.
Sandy: Well, smack my tail [jumps into suit] and call me twitchy! [runs off] I'll be right there! [cut to her arriving in front of SpongeBob's house, where she puts her ear up to the door]
Barky: [off-screen] Bring me a glass of water! Change my soil!
Sandy: [opens door] Huh?
Barky: [being held by SpongeBob] Look out for the roots! Ugh, your breath smells. Why are you all face and no body?
Sandy: Hoo, [slaps knee] doggy! [points to Barky] This little shrub is a real chatterbox.
Barky: Get me out of this dump! A sensitive tree like me needs sun.
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Sandy in downtown Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob is wheelbarrowing Barky along the road.]
Barky: Oh, it's too cold out here. The sun is too bright. Somebody get me a sweater. I want to go back inside.
Sandy: Aww, I wanted to make saltwater trees, but this one's a bit too salty.
SpongeBob: I wonder how everyone else's trees are doing.
[Meanwhile, Mrs. Puff's trees has taken the wheel and is driving down a steep road.]
Mrs. Puff: [screams] I shouldn't have let him drive! [screams as boat hits a trash can, boat runs past SpongeBob and Sandy]

[Bubble transition back to the Krusty Krab, where there is a line to the complaints tree. A customer walks away as Upturn approaches.]
Upturn: [holding bad Krabby Patty] Excuse me, but this Krabby Patty tastes awful.
Mr. Krabs' tree: Well, you look awful, but you don't hear me complaining.
Upturn: Oh, [drops patty] I am offended! [leaves]
Mr. Krabs' tree: And offensive! [sniffs] Oh, P.U., what stinks? Is that the customers, or has the garbage man started making deliveries?
Customer: Huh? [drops tray and leaves]
Mr. Krabs' tree: [laughs]
Customers: [leaving] I'm outta here! This used to be a respectable place.
Mr. Krabs: People are [claws up to eyes] complaining about me complaint department complaining!
[Bubble transition back to Squidward's house, where he is still playing the clarinet badly in front of the tree.]
Squidward's tree: [covering nonexistent ears] Agh, what is that horrible noise? [points] You should register that thing as a lethal weapon.
Squidward: What?
Squidward's tree: It's okay, buddy. Talent isn't everything.
Squidward: Huh.
Squidward's tree: In your case, it's nothing.
[Bubble transition back to Patrick's rock, where he is still watching TV with his tree. There are pizza slices scattered along the ground. Patrick is eating pizza slices from a pizza box. He then sucks on his hand.]

Sir Urchin: Why you!
Snail Fail: [shrugging] What I do?

[The acorns that have been left behind hatch into smaller trees, which wander off in different directions. Mrs. Puff's tree goes up to a telephone and dials the police department.]
Mrs. Puff's tree: [on phone] Hello, police department? I got a lead on that Shell City job.
[Bubble transition to Conch Street, where Squidward's tree is heard talking as Squidward opens the door and takes him outside.]
Squidward's tree: Hey, Squidward, your barber called. He said he's sorry!
Squidward: [tosses tree] Phillistine! [slams door]

Fish: [opens door, angry] Hey! [screams as the acorns grow into trees that enter his house]
[Another tree kicks a trash can over. Another tree throws a banana peel on the ground where a fish is walking.]
Lifeguard fish: [humming, trips over]
[A female fish tramples the lifeguard fish as she runs away from a tree chasing after her. Two more fish run away from several more trees chasing them. The trees steal Barky from SpongeBob's wheelbarrow.]
SpongeBob: Huh?
Tree: Thank you!
Barky: So long, chump!
Mr. Krabs: [with Mrs. Puff and Squidward, all angry] [pointing] There she is! [other people show up] This Arbor Day anarchy is all [points at Sandy] her fault!
Mrs. Puff: Those trees are ruining everything! [gasps as she hears police sirens] Agh! I gotta go. [runs away]
Squidward: Hey, they're made of wood. I say we burn 'em.
Citizens: Yeah! Burn 'em!
SpongeBob: Squidward, that's not the spirit of Arbor Day.
Sandy: Everyone, calm down! I've got a plan.

Sandy: Hm, ah! [runs off]
Tree: [approaching flyer] Ooh.
SpongeBob: [on megaphone, holding flyer] Come on, come all to Log-a-palooza! [approaching tree who pops a balloon from an ice cream stand, giving it a flyer] It's an Arbor Day extravaganza! All you can eat fertilizer! [runs away and approaches two more trees, giving them flyers] If you're a tree, you get in for free. [runs off]
[Bubble transition to the Log-a-palooza in front of Sandy's treedome. Several trees are standing in front of a stage. The trees are chattering, and an air horn blares as Sandy comes onstage wearing a hat and cane.]
Sandy: [waving] Howdy, folks! [points to audience] Are your roots too wrinkly? Are your leaves feeling wilted?
Tree: [rubbing arm] Hmm, my bark is feeling a little rough.
Sandy: Then try my [curtain opens to reveal the machine] wonderful makeover machine, the Arbor Revitalizer! Look your best this Arbor Day! Do I have any volunteers?
Patrick's tree: [next to Patrick, who is wearing a log hat and T-shirt] Yeah, I'll give your [runs up to stage, leaving pot] dumb machine a try.
[Sandy runs the machine, which turns into a suction machine that sucks Patrick's tree in it. It comes out the other end as a chair.]
Tree: [all gasp in horror] Run for your leaves! [all run away]
Chair: Everyone wait! I love it! [trees come back, oohing] I was destined to rot in the woods somewhere, but look at me now! I'm a chair! I've never felt so smooth.]
Trees: Whoa. Phew.
Tree: He does look pretty handsome.
[The trees, and Patrick, start running to the machine.]
Tree #2: I want to be a chair too.
Tree #3: I want to be a credenza!
Tree #4: I want to be a sawhorse!
Patrick: I want to be a table!
[The trees all jump into the machine.]

Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff: [sigh]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs]
[Three fish are sitting on a walking table. Two kids are playing jump rope while two chairs hold the jump ropes.]
Kid: These guys are great! [both laugh]
SpongeBob: [in front of Sandy's treedome, rocking in a chair] Good thinking, Sandy. Furniturizing really calmed these trees down.
[Sandy tries to sit in a chair, but both chairs move away.]
Chairs: [high-five, walk away] Yeah, chairs rule! [laughing]
SpongeBob: [Sandy rubs her back] Well, most of them anyway.

SpongeBob says he is polishing Gary's shell, proceeds to polish Squidward's face, and Squidward says he has a dance performance, then dances. Mr. Krabs invites them to Goo Lagoon to ride on a yacht instead, to which both accept. The next day, SpongeBob and Squidward arrive at Goo Lagoon, and Squidward questions where the yacht is. Krabs tells them that the yacht has to be built first, saying that SpongeBob and Squidward will build it, and he will ""supervise,"" really taking a nap. Squidward takes off the steering wheel before they build the yacht's frame, and Squidward says ""let's get this on with.""Then, Squidward tries to look for the instructions to build a yacht, and SpongeBob implies that he'll ""find it,"" but many objects hit Squidward in the process. SpongeBob finds the instructions and Squidward tells him to give it him, but the instructions fly out of his hands and into Grubby Grouper's boat engine propeller. Squidward fails to get it, but SpongeBob tells him not to worry, he tells him that he and Squidward need to follow their hearts. They begin building the yacht and SpongeBob makes the yacht's mast, floating, but it falls onto Squidward pushing him into the ground. Squidward tells SpongeBob that he should start with the frame and SpongeBob pulls him out with a large hammer. They start building the frame with wooden planks but Squidward gets smacked in the face by a plank after bending it, causing him to get flung. SpongeBob tickles the wooden plank, making it laugh, then bend up. Squidward regrets that, but gets smacked again by the wooden plank. Many frame-building attempts later, they carry on trying to build the yacht, showing as if the yacht frame was not pre-made. SpongeBob says ""we did it, Squidward! Put 'er there!,"" making Squidward handshake him, but the yacht frame collapses. Squidward dances to dodge the planks, but he gets hit by the last one, hitting Mr. Krabs' beach umbrella.Squidward's head shows up inside of the umbrella, and Mr. Krabs growls at Squidward and asks him what he was doing, then he uses the plank to bonk his head. Squidward implies that he and SpongeBob were trying to build the yacht's frame, then Mr. Krabs takes out the pre-made yacht frame. SpongeBob gasps and Mr. Krabs tells him to ""take a look into it,"" causing the pre-made yacht frame to go in his mouth, and stretch out. SpongeBob salutes Mr. Krabs, then he says ""now, get back to work!"" Mr. Krabs puts his umbrella back up, with Squidward stuck on top of it, and Squidward and SpongeBob carry on building the yacht with the pre-made frame.After finishing the building, Squidward reels SpongeBob on the yacht with a fishing rod. SpongeBob asks Squidward if he's seen a safe, which then falls on Squidward. He tries to relax until Krabs reveals the intent to sell patties. SpongeBob opens a window and while Squidward complains, Patrick washes up on board and orders. SpongeBob serves him and he eats them through his snorkel, then gets back in the water. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob start selling patties to all the beach-goers until they hit Bubble Bass. They serve him while they sink. Later in the day, the wise kraken lifts up from the water with the yacht in hand and tells the audience about it and the episode ends.",Abandon Twits,"[The episode opens with the Krusty Krab at night. SpongeBob and Squidward open the front doors and walk out, looking visibly exhausted.]
Squidward: End of another 18-hour shift of misery.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh! [closes doors] Ahoy there! [comes up in front of them and pokes them] And what do you two laddies have planned for this weekend?
SpongeBob: I'm polishing Gary's shell. [face turns into polishing machine as he polishes Squidward's face]
Squidward: Yah! [face glimmers, shakes head, pushing SpongeBob away] Well, I'm going to a post-post-pre-modern unconstructivist dance performance. [begins dancing]
Mr. Krabs: [unimpressed, seeing the flashing lights] Uh, well, that's fascinating. [as Squidward does a dance move from ""Culture Shock"", he grabs both Squidward's and SpongeBob's shoulders] Hey, instead of that malarkey, what would you say to a leisurely weekend sailing trip on me brand-new yacht? Huh? [chuckles, waves hand, sunlight appears] The sun in your face. Huh?
SpongeBob: Ooh. [laughs as sunlight burns and dries him]
Mr. Krabs: [to Squidward] The wind in your-- uh, [rubs Squidward's forehead] head wrinkles.
Squidward: [sighs, forehead waves in wind] Hmm. Well, I wouldn't mind a nice, relaxing ocean cruise.
Mr. Krabs: Great. [walking away] I'll see you at the dock bright and early tomorrow morning.
French Narrator: [narrating time card] The next morning...
[Squidward, in his beach outfit, walks past a sign that says ""GOO LAGOON.""]
Squidward: [humming, groans as he notices SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [in snorkel gear, humming alongside Squidward, meets Mr. Krabs in a sailor shirt] Mr. Krabs, I'm all [pulls inflatable around waist] dressed up and ready to... [puts on snorkel] snorkel.
Squidward: Wait a second.
SpongeBob: [off-screen as wide open shot of Goo Lagoon is shown] Uh, Mr. Krabs, where's your ship?
Squidward: Something smells fishy.
Mr. Krabs: [pushing giant box displaying a yacht] Don't get your mizzenmast in a twist. I got your ship right here. [pats box, opening it, which crushes SpongeBob and Squidward] [shrugging] Ahem, some assembly required.
Squidward: [gear on neck] We have to build the ship?
SpongeBob: [jumping in and out of parts] Yay! We get to build the ship!
Mr. Krabs: Pre-made vessels are for landlubbers. Real sailors build their own ships. Now get to work, you two. [SpongeBob and Squidward slide out, puts on hat] And as an old Navy man, [walking away] I'll be responsible for the most difficult part.
Squidward: And that would be?
Mr. Krabs: [next to lounge chair and umbrella with magazine] Supervising. [gets in lounge chair and begins snoring]
Squidward: [lifting gear from neck] Old Navy man? [tosses gear] Ha! More like old, lazy man. [sees SpongeBob isn't there anymore] Hmm. [sighs, walks over] Oh, boy. All right, let's get this over with. Now, where are the instructions?
SpongeBob: [emerging from parts] I'll find them!
[SpongeBob digs for the instructions, hitting Squidward with some of the parts, including an anchor that crushes him.]
SpongeBob: [holding instructions] Got them! [reading as Squidward gets up, dizzy] Hmm, step one.
Squidward: [snatches instructions] Give me that! [reading] Hmm--huh? [wind carries instructions away]
[The instructions get blown onto Grubby Grouper's boat, and gets shredded in its motor.]
Squidward: Now what are we supposed to do?
SpongeBob: [arm on Squidward] Don't worry, Squidward, [points to self] I know exactly how to handle this situation.
Squidward: Oh, really?
SpongeBob: We just need to [twirls, tossing instruction pieces into air] follow our hearts. ♪ La, la, la ♪
Squidward: Oh. [shreds of paper hit his face]
[Squidward pulls a string from the pile of parts.]
SpongeBob: [calling off-screen] Squidward, I did the first piece. [mast is floating mid-air]
Squidward: SpongeBob, you clam-head, you don't put up the mast first.
SpongeBob: [shouting] What's that, Squidward? [mast begins to fall]
Squidward: I said, ""SpongeBob, you clam-head""-- [gets repeatedly hit into the ground by the mast, groans]
[SpongeBob uses a hammer to pry Squidward out from the ground, leaving him in a wonky shape.]
Squidward: You have to start with the frame.
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Squidward holding a plank.]
Squidward: All right, now bend it into a boat shape. [both bend plank into arch, brushes plank before it launches him into the air] D'oh! [lands in the distance]
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob tickling a plank.]
SpongeBob: Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Squidward: SpongeBob, wood planks are not--
Wood plank: [grows a face and laughs, forms an arch]
Squidward: Ticklish. [gets hit with plank, he lands in the distance while he is screaming, and gets crushed by an anchor]
French Narrator: [narrating time card] Many frame-building attempts later...
[SpongeBob walks up to a boat frame.]
SpongeBob: We did it, Squidward! [reaches out hand to an injured Squidward] Put her there.
Squidward: [weakly] Hooray. [shakes SpongeBob's hand with crutch]
[Then, the frame falls apart, sending several wood planks flying around. Squidward tries to dodge them using his dance techniques. He gets hit anyway, and lands inside Mr. Krabs' umbrella.]
Mr. Krabs: [wakes up, gasps] Huh? [growls at Squidward] What in the name of all that's salty are you doing? [holds up plank and bonks Squidward with it] You're wasting expensive lumber-er-er-er.
Squidward: We're trying to build the ship's frame, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Pfft. [grabs ship frame box from pile of parts] Building the frame? They give you one all ready to go.
SpongeBob: Ooh.
Mr. Krabs: [opening box, revealing yellow glow] Take a gander, boy-o.
SpongeBob: Ooh-- [gags as the ship frame enters him and takes form] [saluting] I'm shipshape, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Now get back to work. [walks off] The tide's going out.
[Squidward tries to get out of Mr. Krabs' umbrella, but Mr. Krabs opens the umbrella just as he is about to escape.]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs and goes back to sleep]
[Bubble transition to Squidward using a hammer on a wood plank on the frame. SpongeBob jumps out of a bowl of nails and uses his holes to spread them along the top of the frame. He grabs two hammers and hammers them all in, except one of them doesn't go in all the way. SpongeBob tries to hammer it in, but it doesn't work.]
SpongeBob: [eyeing nail] Oh, a stubborn one, eh?
[Squidward pushes a wood plank into place and hammers it. SpongeBob spits into his hands, rubs them together, and picks up the hammer, which he uses to hammer down the nail hard. This causes the plank Squidward hammered in to come loose and hit in in the face. SpongeBob continues to violently hammer in the nail while Squidward carries a wood plank. A ship part hits his head.]
Squidward: Huh? Whoa!
[Squidward tries to dodge a wood plank as it drops as well. A paint bucket lands on the other end of the plank and launches him into the air. He drops to the ground, and the paint bucket gets launched into the air as it lands directly onto his head.]
Squidward: [stands up, groaning as paint is on his face]
[A rope drops onto Squidward, which quickly begins to entangle him.]
Squidward: Huh?
[An anchor drops onto Squidward's head, making him dizzy and see Squidward sailors spinning on his head.]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Squidward! [Squidward shakes his head] [waving from top of frame] Did you see an anchor? I think I dropped one.
Squidward: [stands up] Why don't we switch places? [points to SpongeBob then to the ground] You work down here and [points to himself then to SpongeBob] I'll work up there.
[Bubble transition to Squidward hammering in a nail.]
Squidward: [sighs] Much safer. Never work below an idiot.
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Oops! Look out above!
Squidward: Above? [a concrete brick, a tire, and a refrigerator land on him; he now has a missing bottom tooth] That's it!
[Squidward picks up a hook and throws it onto SpongeBob working below. It hooks onto his pants.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [gets pulled up by Squidward, who growls at him] Oh, hi, Squidward. Have you seen a safe up here? I think I dropped it.
Squidward: [safe drops onto him, opens up safe door] [growls] From now on, you're working next to me where I can keep an eye on you.
SpongeBob: [gets up] Aw, that's so sweet, Squidward. [hugs Squidward, who gets hit by a hammer landing on his head, causing an explosion]
French Narrator: [narrating time card] Even more boat-building attempts later...
[SpongeBob is standing on the ground in awe.]
SpongeBob: Wow. [hollering] Mr. Krabs, your ship is finished!
Squidward: [rolling in, severely injured and in a wheelchair] We use the term ""ship"" very loosely.
[Mr. Krabs pushes the ship box out of the way to reveal a very poorly put-together ship as a foghorn blares.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, a little off the beam. Hmm... Hmm, [holds two white paint buckets] I know! All she needs is a nice, shiny coat of paint. [tosses white paint onto the ship, turning it into a proper ship] [looking at sign on ship that says ""S.S. SEA-SCRET FORMULA""] The S.S. Sea-cret Formula is ready to set sail... [pointing] as soon as you two drag her into the lagoon.
[Mr. Krabs stands on the front of the ship as SpongeBob and Squidward use strings to pull the ship across the beach, where the beachgoers are watching them.]
Mr. Krabs: Mush!
SpongeBob and Squidward: [seeing giant shadow above] Huh?
[They all get washed over by a giant wave, which miraculously sets the ship afloat. Mr. Krabs uses a hook to pull Squidward onto the ship, who gasps like a fish.]
Squidward: [sitting in lounge chair] Well, at least this weekend isn't a total waste.
Mr. Krabs: Not so fast, Mr. Squidward. [pointing to Squidward] You still have work to do. [climbs onto top of ship]
Squidward: Huh? Work?
Mr. Krabs: [reveals mast with Krusty Krab's logo on it] Welcome to the grand opening of the Krusty Krab of the high seas... and even higher prices. [laughs, winks]
Squidward: Huh! Forget it! [crosses arms] I am not moving from this spot.
Mr. Krabs: No problem. [pulls rope that puts Squidward in his cash register]
Squidward: Huh?
[Squidward's employee hat is put on, The Gallery Grub menu appears, and SpongeBob puts in the kitchen window frame.]
SpongeBob: How exciting, Squidward! I get to flip patties and be-- [gags] Seasick at the same time. [throws up off-screen]
Squidward: We're not gonna sell any food in the middle of a lagoon!
Patrick: [in snorkel outfit, washing up in front of Squidward] I'd like one Krabby Patty combo [points] with extra combo on it.
[Patrick gives Squidward a dollar, and SpongeBob starts flipping patties in the kitchen. He sets Patrick's meal on the kitchen window and rings the bell. SpongeBob then gags and throws up again.]
Squidward: [giving Patrick his tray] Your order.
Patrick: At ease, sailor. [puts on snorkel and drinks through it as he walks off]
Squidward: [sighs]
Patrick: [tries to use diving board, but fails and falls into the ocean]
Mr. Krabs: [steering the ship while humming]
[SpongeBob greets Mr. Krabs, who winks at him as he cranks the steering wheel. SpongeBob salutes him, then jumps down attached to a rope with a plate of Krabby Patties.]
SpongeBob: Whee!
[SpongeBob tosses a patty to a customer, who gives him a gesture. SpongeBob laughs as he gives two patties to two snorkelers, which use their snorkels to eat them.]
Snorkelers: Mmm!
[SpongeBob heads back up to the top of the ship as he throws several patties to some women in a pyramid formation holding onto a motorboat with a shrimp driving it. The women all form a heart shape after they eat their patties. SpongeBob throws some more patties to two children inside an orca's mouth, which shuts. Squidward's cash register raises up as SpongeBob gives a patty to a flying customer. Squidward isn't paying attention and is reading a magazine.]
Customer: Ooh. [eats patty and gives SpongeBob a dollar as he flies away]
SpongeBob: [puts dollar into register] Huh? [uses monocular] Hmm... I didn't know there was an island in Goo Lagoon. [sees Bubble Bass playing in the ocean, who laughs] Huh? [points ahead] Butt-berg, dead ahead!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Huh? [grabs onto steering wheel] Everyone, hold fast!
SpongeBob: [climbing onto mast] Whoa! [screams and rings bell]
[Squidward raises his sunglasses and looks at SpongeBob. The ship's horn blows as Bubble Bass notices it approaching him.]
Bubble Bass: Great Neptune's nose hair!
Mr. Krabs: [screams, bumps into steering wheel]
SpongeBob: [screams while ringing bell, causing the ship to tilt forwards and make Squidward bump into the register]
[Bubble Bass' butt scrapes the side of the ship, peeling off its exterior. Bubble Bass then stops and looks at the damage.]
Bubble Bass: Hmm...
[The ship begins to sink, and Squidward plays ""Taps"" on his clarinet.]
Bubble Bass: [waving dollar] One double Krabby Patty, please.
[Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into dollar bills as he fully sinks. SpongeBob gives Bubble Bass his patty, who eats it and paddles away. Squidward finally fully sinks into the ocean.  The scene fades to an open shot of the lagoon at sunset, as a woman shuts the door to a tiki booth and walks off. The scene fades to near the Goo Lagoon sign, where the screen darkens as the sun sets. Bubbles form on the surface of the lagoon, and the ship emerges, which is being held by the wise kraken.]
Wise kraken: [roars, goes back to normal] Give me all the Krabby Patties you got, kid. Oh, I'm so hungry, I could eat at the Chum Bucket and like it. Boy, I'll tell you-- [camera irises out on ship]
SpongeBob: [gags]
Squidward: [sighs] Oh, boy.",0.32,Luke Brookshier

The scene cuts to a robotic version of SpongeBob's pineapple, where a holographic mailman delivers mail. We see a robot version of SpongeBob, named SpongeBot, wake up and go through his daily routine: unplugging himself from his bed, assembling his body and face in the bathroom, then eating nuts, bolts, and grease for breakfast. RoboGary enters, and SpongeBot uses a laser pointer from his nose to play with him. SpongeBot's alarm alerts him that it's time to work, but RoboGary wants to keep playing. SpongeBot says goodbye to Gary and equips his Krusty Krab hat, which is a many-legged robot. As he adjusts the hat into position, RoboGary opens up SpongeBot's back and hides inside of him. Unaware, SpongeBot leaves the house.SpongeBot first stops by SquidBot at his house, who is assembling a clone of himself. Annoyed, SquidBot kicks him away, and finishes the clone, who self-destructs after realizing he has to live next to SpongeBot. Next, SpongeBot greets Pat-Tron at his house, who wants to come to work with him, but powers down. A hologram explains that he is recharging, and SpongeBot promises to bring him fuel from work. RoboGary peeks out of SpongeBot's back as he turns around, poking Pat-Tron's body.SpongeBot arrives late to work, where SquidBot is waiting. SpongeBot uses a key in his finger to open The Krabby Battery, pressing a button that makes a giant hand drop a large battery into a receptacle. This forms the basis of the restaurant. Inside, Mr. Krabs is a robot on a track, who is malfunctioning and repeatedly saying, ""You're fired!"" SpongeBot hits him with a large wrench to fix him. SquidBot comments that he wishes he was fired, much to SpongeBot's horror, and RoboKrabs orders them both back to work.SpongeBot begins by cooking ""Krabby Batteries,"" frying them on the grill and cutting up small batteries as condiments. RoboGary, still inside SpongeBot's body, leans out to taste some, but electrocutes himself. SquidBot leans his head into the kitchen to relay an order, and Gary crashes into him, fusing them together. To SpongeBot's horror, Gary runs out of the restaurant with SquidBot stuck upside-down to his shell. Gary briefly stops to do his business (expelling a small amount of nuts and bolts, which SpongeBot cleans up), then runs into the Grease Bucket. PlankBot, a wind-up toy version of Plankton, sees them causing chaos. He attempts to chase after them, but winds down. A fish version of Karen winds him back up, and SpongeBot stops by to ask her which way Gary went.Still with SquidBot on his body, Gary runs into the street, causing a traffic collision. The angry citizens chase after him and SpongeBot. Gary also passes through the house of Sandroid, a large robot head that resembles Sandy, triggering her to wake up. Sandroid flies off to attack him, and SpongeBot follows them. PlankTron follows behind, but is run over by robot citizens, and Karen sets him back upright.At Lube Lagoon, robots are seen sun tanning, playing volleyball, and selling hot dogs. Suddenly, GrandPat appears from the time closet, only to read the Lube Lagoon sign and realize he is not where he expected. Seeing a swarm of angry robots, he retreats back into the closet. Meanwhile, the robots (including Sandroid) chase Gary to the lagoon, and SpongeBot thinks of a plan to stop them. He comes up with the idea to build a brick wall, uses a rocket to reach the shore, and quickly builds the entire wall. He tells Gary to stop before he crashes, but Gary proceeds to crash through the wall, followed by the robot citizens and Sandroid. Gary is now detached from SquidBot, and runs off happily chasing a flutterbot (a robot butterfly).However, the rest of the robots are stuck in the lagoon, as Sandroid approaches from below. She pulls them all under the water, and after a surge of electricity, combines them all into one large body. Sandroid launches plugs out of her mouth to capture the rest of the robots on the beach, reinforcing her body. She surfaces and begins riding Bikini Atoll, revving up one of the trees like a motor and jet-skiing away. She announces a ""rise of the robots,"" which PlankTron (who is stuck on her finger) supports. The French Narrator appears and says that, while the viewer may believe robots will never replace humans, ""anything can happen in a cartoon."" He begins stuttering and glitching in a robotic manner as Sandroid heads towards a real-life city skyline in the distance.",Welcome to Binary Bottom,"[The French Narrator speaks in front of a starry void.]
French Narrator: Imagine if you will, the town of Bikini Bottom. Now imagine if everyone who lived there was a robot. [tunes his helmet to static] Submitted for your approval, [the static turns to Bikini Bottom, then Binary Bottom] a trip to Binary Bottom.
[Zoom to a metalic house that looks like SpongeBob's pineapple. A drone beams a holographic mailman down, who sticks the mail in the mailbox, making it beep. The drone flies away. In the house, SpongeBot is woken up by his alarm. SpongeBot wakes up, without his face. He pulls a mess of plugs out from an outlet on his back.]
SpongeBot: [yawns, stretches, stutters] I'm re-re-ready. I'm re-re-ready. I'm re-re-ready. I'm red-red-ready.
[SpongeBot goes to his bathroom. The mirror places his eyes on his face, then drills holes in his head and gives him a nose. It attaches two antenna on the sides of his body and his mouth. SpongeBot stretches up to the mirror.]
SpongeBot: Morning, SpongeBot! Ooh, you're looking handsome today! [the mirror SpongeBot kisses him] Mwah! Aww! [giggles]
[SpongeBot goes off to the kitchen and takes his seat. A bowl rises from the table. SpongeBot uses a tube from his head to shoot bolts into it, then oil. He changes his hand into a spoon and eats the bolts. A robot Gary comes out of a pet door.]
Robo-Gary: [meow]
SpongeBot: [stuttering] Good--good--good morning, Robo-Gary.
[He pets him and throws some bolts to him, and they eat them. Robo-Gary swallows and the swirl on his shell lights up green.]
Robo-Gary: [meow]
SpongeBot: [laughs]
Robo-Gary: [meows and jumps up and down]
SpongeBot: Oh, you wanna play. I know what you want.
[SpongeBot shoots a laser out of his nose.]
Robo-Gary: [meows]
SpongeBot: [shines laser around as Gary chases it] Gary, be gentle with the little laser!
[Gary bites the laser and swallows it.]
SpongeBot: [disgusted] Ew.
[SpongeBot's alarm comes in and blows him off his chair. SpongeBot flips his body back upright.]
SpongeBot: Oh! Time for work, Gary. [pets him] I'll play with you more when I get home.
[Robo-Gary extends a magnet out of his shell and sticks to SpongeBot. He gives him puppy dog eyes.]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBot: No, no, Gare-bearings. You have to stay here at home. [sticks him to the fridge]
Robo-Gary: Meow?
[SpongeBot beams his antenna to a receptacle near his front door, and a Krusty Krab hat pops out of his head. It's on the right side of his head.]
SpongeBot: [to hat] A little more to the left.
[The hat grows legs and walks to the left. Robo-Gary opens up SpongeBot's back and jumps inside, then closes it.]
SpongeBot: [as hat walks] Almost there. [stutters] P-p-p-perfect! [waving] See you later, [stutters] G-G-G-Gary.
[Gary's eyes come out of SpongeBot's body. SpongeBot taps his door and opens it, then goes outside.]
[Cut to SquidBot outside his house, pulling something out of a box. A headless clone is next to him.]
SquidBot: [sighs] Finally, someone whose company I actually enjoy-- [takes out clone of his head] me!
SquidBot clone: Ha ha ha.
SquidBot: Ha ha ha.
SquidBot clone: Ha ha ha.
SpongeBot: [with megaphone mouth] Time for work, SquidBot! [has a siren on his head and circles around as SquidBot tries to carry his clone's head] Time for work, SquidBot! [extends his eyes] Time for work, SquidBot! Time for work, SquidBot!
SquidBot: [grumbles, shoves SpongeBot] Power down and leave me alone, SpongeBot! I've still got 15 minutes!
SpongeBot: Oh, [extends eyes] sorry, SquidBot! Sorry, SquidBot! Sorry, SquidBot!
SquidBot: [grunts, kicks him away] Go away! [puts the head on his clone and spins it]
SquidBot clone: I am going to have to live next to that?
[The clone opens a panel on his chest with a self-destruct button and presses it, exploding. Its parts rain down on SquidBot.]
SquidBot: [sighs]
[SpongeBot goes up a holographic version of Patrick's rock.]
SpongeBot: [knocks on rock] Knock, knock, knock. Hey Pat-Tron, I'm going to work!
Pat-Tron: I'm going with you, SpongeBot! I gotta fuel up!
SpongeBot: Hooray! [confetti comes out of his mouth]
Pat-Tron: Hooray! [voice fades and he falls asleep]
[The drone projecting Pat-Tron's house flies next to Pat-Tron and beams a holographic version of him.]
Pat-Tron hologram: [pats Pat-Tron's body] Pat-Tron is currently in recharge mode.
SpongeBot: [laughs] OK, buddy. I'll bring you some fuel on my way back home.
[As SpongeBot drives away, Robo-Gary's eyes come out and poke Pat-Tron's hand.]
[Cut to a giant battery receptacle. SquidBot files his nails with a power sander. SpongeBot comes up to him.]
SquidBot: If you're going to be late, give me the key.
SpongeBot: Ooh, sorry, SquidBot. But... ♪ The key bone's connected to the finger bone! ♪ [key comes out of his finger, he laughs and plugs it in]
[A giant hand drops a battery into the receptacle. A sign reading ""The Krabby Battery"" unfolds. A robot version of Mr. Krabs comes out of his office.]
RoboKrabs: You're fired! You're fired! You're fired! You're fired! You're fired! You're fired!
[SpongeBot inhales, pops a wrench out of his head, and hits RoboKrabs, who wheezes and gets dizzy, then comes back up.]
RoboKrabs: Thank you, Bot-O. I got stuck in the firing mode.
SquidBot: [looks up from magazine] Ahh, to be fired.
[SpongeBot gasps and shuts up SquidBot with multiple hands.]
RoboKrabs: Nobody's getting fired, you robo-loafer. Everybody get to work! [rockets backwards] Whoa!
[SpongeBot salutes and goes backwards into the kitchen. He turns his hand into a spatula and serves a bunch of battery pieces.]
SpongeBot: Whoop! The Krabby Batteries are sizzlin'! Now it's time for condiments.
[He turns his other hand into a cleaver and faces the condiments, and chops them up. Robo-Gary reaches out of SpongeBot's back and looks at the batteries cooking. He licks one, but short-circuits and jumps into the air.]
SquidBot: [through order window] Food up, SpongeBot. [reads paper] Gimme two batteries on a barge and make 'em cry.
[Robo-Gary falls onto SquidBot's head, and they both get electrocuted. SpongeBot stops cutting the condiments. SquidBot and Robo-Gary fall into the deep fryer, which is full of oil.]
SpongeBot: Robo-Gary!? SquidBot!? Nooo!
[SquidBot rises from the oil, mumbling. Robo-Gary is stuck on his head.]
SpongeBot: Gary-Squid? Squid-Gary? [spits out a paper] Does not compute. Does not compute.
SquidBot: [trying to remove Robo-Gary] Get your filthy robo-snail off my head!
[Robo-Gary drives off with SquidBot stuck on his shell.]
SpongeBot: [shouting] Gary!
[They each crash through the wall. Robo-Gary stops at two metallic flowers, sniffs them, and dumps bolts out of his backside. SpongeBot wheels by and sees the bolts]
SpongeBot: Whoa! [turns his hand into a vacuum and cleans them up, then keeps chasing]
[Cut to the Grease Bucket, a robotic version of the Chum Bucket. SquidBot and Robo-Gary drive in and crash into everything.]
SquidBot: I've gotta cut off this pooping parasite!
[A wind-up toy version of Plankton is seen in the kitchen.]
PlankBot: All right, what the kelp is going on in here? [growls]
[PlankBot slowly advances on Robo-Gary and SquidBot, who drive backwards out of the building.]
PlankBot: Come back here, you nickel-plated nincompoops! [powers down]
Karen: [winds him up] PlankBot, you forgot to wind yourself again.
PlankBot: Thanks, Karen, my flesh and blood wife. Don't worry, I'll get him. [growls]
[Cut to show that Karen is a fish with hair and glasses resembling her robot version.]
SpongeBot: Hi, Karen. Did Gary come through here?
Karen: [points to hole] He went thataway, Chuckles.
SpongeBot: [stuttering] Th-th-th-thank you! [goes backwards out of the restaurant]
Karen: Mama told me not to marry a robot.
[SquidBot and Robo-Gary run into traffic and cause a traffic jam.]
SquidBot: Ahh! Gangway! Runaway robot! [crashing] Ahh!
SpongeBot: [going over crashed robots] Excuse me, pardon me, Excuse me, pardon me. Excuse me, pardon me.
[The robots rise, take out weapons, and chase him. Robo-Gary and SquidBot drive into a hologram of Sandy's treedome, which turns it from green to red. Sandroid flies away.]
Sandroid: Who disturbs the sacred dome of Sandroid? [takes lasso out of mouth] I'll hogtie your actuators!
SpongeBot: Sandroid, wait! Gary is too young to have his actuators hogtied!
PlankBot: [slowly walking behind] I'll hack your hard drives, you cybernetic simpletons!
[The robots run over him. Karen, on a hover scooter, picks him up and puts him back upright.]
Karen: All right, there you go.
[Cut to Lube Lagoon. Robot versions of Mrs. Puff and Lady Upturn are sunbathing. They heat up and hands come out of an umbrella and flip them over. Their backs heat up. A robotic hot dog vendor presses a button on his chest to show a cart with robotic hot dogs, and puts one in a bun.]
Hot dog vendor: Robo-dog! Get your robo-dog!
[Robot versions of Larry, Bubble Bass, and Mama Bass are playing volleyball. Larry spikes it into Bubble Bass, making him explode. Mama Bass shakes her head. The time closet appears next to the entrance of Lube Lagoon, and GrandPat comes out.]
GrandPat: [reads sign] Lube Lagoon? What happened to Goo Lagoon? Where in space and time am I? [takes out map] Looks like I took a wrong turn at the last apocalypse.
SquidBot: [off-screen] Danger! Danger!
GrandPat: Aah!
[All the robots are heading after GrandPat.]
SquidBot: Rogue robot!
SpongeBot: Gary, wait! Come back!
Sandroid: Who dares defy Sandroid?
PlankBot: I'm gonna destroy all of you!
GrandPat: [exclaims] These junk heaps want my flab for fuel!
[He goes back into the time closet. SquidBot and Robo-Gary crash into the Lube Lagoon sign and head towards the lagoon.]
SpongeBot: No, Gary! Not the lagoon! What do I do now? Got to think.
[He presses a ""Think"" button on his palm. A thought cloud comes out of his body. He thinks of a TV dinner, a shoe, and a brick wall.]
SpongeBot: That's it! A brick wall!
[He presses a ""Rocket"" button on his palm and a rocket comes out of his back. He flies to the lagoon and lays down mortar. He builds a giant live-action brick wall, stands on it, and blows a whistle.]
SpongeBot: [waving arms] Gary! Stop!
[Robo-Gary and SquidBot are still heading towards the lagoon. They roll together.]
SpongeBot: [takes out stop sign] Gary, stop! [takes out ""Don't Walk"" buzzer] Gary, stop! [takes out traffic light] Gary, stop! [sits down, to audience] He's not gonna stop.
[Gary and SquidBot roll into the wall and break it. The robots, including Sandroid, ride into the lagoon. Robo-Gary hops out.]
Robo-Gary: [happy meowing, chases butterfly]
SpongeBot: Play nice with the flutterbot!
[SquidBot and some robot fish rise in the lagoon. Sandroid is seen beneath them. Her eyes open. Fish are pulled down, and then SpongeBot himself. A giant electric burst happens. The lagoon bubbles. Sandroid rises with a giant robot body.]
Robo-Gary: [as Sandroid looms over him] Meow?
[Sandroid's entire body rises out of the ocean.]
Robo-Rube: Amazing! [opens his head to use a camera]
Sandroid: Flash photography is forbidden in the presence of Sandroid! [takes wires out of mouth] You will all be assimilated! [smiles, normal voice] So we can all be as close as peas in a pod! [deep voice] Yee-haw!
Robo-Rube: Ama--
[He and the rest of the robots are captured by Sandroid's wires.]
SquidBot: [to SpongeBot] Well, this is another fine metallic monstrosity you've got me into.
SpongeBot: Look at it this way, SquidBot. Now we'll have a chance to catch up with all our neighbors. Hi, Rube.
Robo-Rube: Well, hello!
SquidBot: Typical. [buzzes] Typical. [buzzes] Typical. [buzzes, SpongeBot hits him with a wrench]
[Sandroid's body rises out of the ocean. It gets on Bikini Atoll and uses it like a jetski.]
Sandroid: Rise of the robots! Yee-haw!
PlankBot: [on Sandroid's finger] I second that! [roars]

Plankton is playing with Spot, and has left instructions for Karen on how to care for him. Plankton's taxi arrives, and he says goodbye to Karen and Spot. Karen finds that Spot has gotten off his leash, and ripped up all the sticky notes Plankton left. Confident that she can still take care of Spot, Karen analyzes him with a laser beam, but Spot chases after it. Karen runs after Spot, but mistakenly squishes him, reducing him to a green puddle on the ground. She takes a pump out of her finger and inflates him. While this works at first, he bursts afterwards, sending Karen into despair.SpongeBob arrives at the Chum Bucket, bringing Gary for his playdate with Spot. Karen tries to cover up Spot exploding, but lets it slip and begins crying. SpongeBob laughs it off, going into the Chum Bucket anyways. He calls Spot back together, explaining that it happens all the time when he plays with Gary. Spot runs rampant around the restaurant, eating various items, and SpongeBob suggests that he go on a walk to burn off some energy.SpongeBob walks Gary, as Karen follows behind with Spot. Gary slimes a fire hydrant, but Spot dissolves it, causing water to spurt out. The water spills onto the street and makes multiple drivers crash. Karen berates Spot, only for him to dissolve the leash and run off. Meanwhile, Gary rescues some injured passengers. SpongeBob rides on Karen and they chase after Spot, but he is too fast for them to catch. Just then, Plankton calls, saying that he is coming home early because the convention is over and he bought an explosive device. He asks Karen to put Spot on the phone, so SpongeBob throws it, crushing Spot. Spot barks into the receiver, reassuring Plankton.Karen finally catches Spot, and brings him home. Spot growls and barks loudly, having not been fed. Karen tries to find him some food, but he eats the entire contents of the restaurant, and is still unsatisfied. She synthesizes a ""perpetual nutrient pill"" to keep him full, but it causes Spot to expand repeatedly, since it never disintegrates. Plankton arrives home to see the Chum Bucket entirely enveloped by Spot, destroying the building and continuing to grow. Plankton and Karen get into an argument, but SpongeBob gets an idea. He pulls out a dog treat, causing Spot to come back home and divide into a smaller version of himself. However, the giant version of Spot continues floating, swallowing the Sun whole as the episode ends.",Karen for Spot,"[The episode begins with an open shot of the Chum Bucket. Spot is heard barking.]
Karen: [folding tiny underwear] All right, Plankton. [puts underwear into tiny suitcase and closes it] I managed to hit 12 changes of underwear into your suitcase. [picks up suitcase] Will that be enough for the trip?
Plankton: [laughing, playing with Spot] I'm gonna be gone for three days, Karen, so yeah, that should cover it. [Spot licks him and he laughs] That's right, Spot. Daddy has to go to the annual [pets Spot] Doomsday Device Expo in Shell City. [cradling Spot] He's gonna find you an instrument of ultimate evil. Yes, he is.
Spot: [gets up and barks, next to several sticky notes]
Plankton: Don't worry, boy. [patting sticky note] I left lots of instructions for Mommy, so she knows exactly how to care for you while I'm gone. [zoom out to reveal several sticky notes plastered onto the wall] My wittle man just needs [holding Spot's cheeks] wots of extra wove, and I would destroy the whole world if anything happened to him. [hands go inside Spot]
Karen: [off-screen, taxi honks] Oh, your taxi's here. [opens door, holding Spot on leash]
[The taxi pulls up in front of the Chum Bucket. They all walk to the taxi.]
Karen: Off you go, Sheldon.
Plankton: [entering taxi] So long, Karen. Bye, Spotty! [taxi runs off]
Karen: [waves] Bye, Plankton. Have a nice trip. Looks like it's just you and me, Spot. [looks down to see Spot has escaped the leash] Spot? [comes inside to see Spot tearing up the sticky notes, gasps as screen turns into a ""!""] [facepalms] Oh, Plankton's instructions! Spot, bad amoeba.
Spot: [barks excitedly]
Karen: Oh, who needs Plankton's little notes? A sophisticated AI like myself should have no problem with a simple organic being. All he needs is [screen turns into text reading ""ANALYZING""] a basic analysis. [laser pointer comes out of her, which points ahead of Spot]
Spot: [barks, runs off]
Karen: [running after Spot] No! I'm not done analyzing you! [Spot goes through double doors] Spot! Heel, boy. Heel!
Spot: [barks, sits]
Karen: [accidentally runs over Spot] Uh-oh. [poking Spot puddle] Is he supposed to do that? Hmm, maybe he needs a little pumping up. [air pump comes out of her finger]
[Karen inserts the air pump into Spot and starts inflating him to a large degree. She takes out the air pump and puts the air pump back in her finger.]
Karen: [patting Spot, smiling] There you go, Spot.
Spot: [barks, explodes]
Karen: [screams] I killed him! [hears door knocking] Huh? [gasps, looks through window and hides, then hestitantly opens door] Who sent you? What do you know?
SpongeBob: [with Gary on his head, waving] Hi, Karen. [holding and spinning Gary] Gary has a playdate with Spot, remember?
Gary: Meow.
Karen: Uh, oh, with Spot, huh? [laughs nervously] Well, uh, the thing is, Spot can't play today because he's, uh-- he--busy. He's busy. He's, uh, busy being, um... [dial-up beeps] All over the place in bits and pieces because I exploded him! [crying, filling SpongeBob with oil]
SpongeBob: [laughing, deflating] Yeah, that's Spot all right. [laughs and goes inside with Gary]
Karen: [going inside] Huh?
SpongeBob: [calling out] Spot, come to SpongeBob! [whistles]
[All of Spot's pieces in the room come together in SpongeBob's hand to reform him.]
Karen: How did you figure that out?
SpongeBob: [lets go of Spot, who bounces] This happens all the time when he plays with Gary.
[Spot barks, then Gary splats him with his eye stalks. This repeats.]
Karen: Oh, I admit, looking after Spot while Plankton is gone is proving trickier than I thought.
[Spot hops on some tables, sucks up an entire food plate, and chews on a ketchup bottle, making him squirt ketchup all over the place while flying in the air.]
SpongeBob: [shrugging] Maybe he needs to burn off some energy?
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob walking Gary on a leash. Karen struggles to pull Spot along on his leash.]
Karen: How are you so strong?
[They all arrive in downtown Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob takes Gary off of his leash, and Karen sighs. Gary slithers around a fire hydrant and leaves a trail behind. Spot approaches the hydrant and burps acid onto it, disintegrating it, as well as making a hole below.]
Gary: Meow? [water shoots out of hole] Meow! [hides in shell] Meow.
[The hole causes a flood to happen, making the traffic crash into each other, including a fire truck.]
Karen: Spot, look at this mess!
SpongeBob: Come on, Spot. Don't you want to be a good boy like Gary?
Gary: [siren blares, with first aid outfit on] Meow. [slithers away]
Spot: [burps acid onto his leash, freeing him and running off, barking]
Karen: [she and SpongeBob start chasing after Spot] Spot, no! Bad boy!
[Gary uses his teeth to carry a pedestrian out of the traffic crash. Meanwhile, Spot is bouncing past several people.]
Mustached man: Whoa! [mustache jumps onto his head]
Kid: [Spot eats his ice cream, cries]
[Spot goes through a police officer's donut and bounces past him. SpongeBob and Karen are still chasing after him.]
SpongeBob: [calling from on top of Karen] Spot! [runs past everyone, knocking over the mustached man's mustache and accidentally taking away the cop's donut]
Cop: [accidentally eats hand]
SpongeBob: [pointing to donut on his nose] I nose this ain't my donut. [rimshot, launches donut]
Cop: Oh. [donut launches into his mouth]
[Karen is still chasing after Spot.]
Karen: He's too fast! How can this get any worse? [phone icon appears on screen as it rings]
SpongeBob: [takes out telephone from Karen's head] Karen's head, how may I direct your call?
Plankton: [on phone] Oh, yes. May I talk to Karen? Wait a minute. Who is this?
Karen: [takes phone] Uh, uh, that was me... [laughs] Throwing my voice, and now it's you. How's the Doomsday Expo?
[Cut to Plankton at the Doomsday Expo, where several villains are seen, and the building is heavily damaged from fire.]
Plankton: Oh, it's over. I'm coming home early.
Karen: [on phone] You're what?
Plankton: But I bought the most evil world-conquering device I could find. [holds a sphere with runes on it, and souls escape from it] Anyway, [puts away device] how's my little Spot? Put him on the phone. I miss his voice.
[The scene cuts back to Karen, where she is stopped at a crosswalk as Spot moves past her.]
Karen: Put Spot on the phone?
SpongeBob: Whoa!
Karen: This phone?
SpongeBob: [whimpers] Ooh. [lassos telephone straight onto Spot, crushing him]
Spot: [on phone, barking]
Plankton: [cutting back to him] There's my wittle man. Sounds like Mommy is taking good care of you.
Firefighter: [holding onto tiny suitcase with tongs] Hey, some idiot left this tiny suitcase next to an open flame! [drops tongs and suitcase] Oh, no.
[The building explodes, causing everyone to scream and leave.]
Plankton: Uh, gotta go. [runs off]
Spot: [cut back to him, starts running off]
[The traffic starts to move quickly, and Karen presses the crosswalk button. She and SpongeBob cross the road and continue after Spot. Karen finally manages to catch Spot with her hands.]
Karen: Whew, let's get back before Plankton comes home.
[An ambulance comes by and stops in front of them. Gary comes out.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Gary. How was your shift?
Gary: Meow.
[Bubble transition back to the Chum Bucket, where SpongeBob and Karen are sitting at a table, eating bowls of chum.]
Spot: [barking angrily]
Karen: [raising voice] What's wrong? [pokes SpongeBob's chum] You haven't touched your chum.
SpongeBob: [raising voice] No, thank you. I don't really eat chum.
Karen: Yep, me neither. [tosses bowl of chum]
Spot: [jumps onto table, barking angrily]
SpongeBob: [raising voice] Karen? Have you fed Spot yet?
Karen: No, does he not consume power from his battery?
SpongeBob: [raising voice] Uh, no. He consumes... other stuff. [slides chum bowl to Spot]
Spot: [sniffs, eats entire bowl, continues barking]
Karen: Are you still hungry?
Spot: [barks angrily]
Karen: Okay, how 'bout a nice, um, [holds napkin dispenser] a napkin dispenser?
Spot: [eats napkin dispenser holder, continues barking]
SpongeBob: Gee, Spot'll eat anything, huh?
French Narrator: [narrating time card] One humongous meal later...
[Spot eats the Chum Bucket's lab doors and returns to Karen, still barking like usual. He eats the seat Karen is sitting on.]
Karen: [growls] No more, Spot. You literally just ate us out of house and home.
Spot: [continues barking]
Karen: [picks up Spot] Fine, you're still hungry? [slaps Spot] I'll give you all the nourishment you'll ever need. [screen turns into a pill, and one pops out of her, which she picks up] Here, I synthesized a perpetual [feeds Spot pill] nutrient pill. [Spot drops down] It'll keep feeding you so you'll be full. Forever. [Spot starts growing exponentially] Huh? Uh--
SpongeBob: Hey, Karen? Is he supposed to be getting bigger?
Karen: That was not in my calculations.
SpongeBob: It's gonna stop soon? Right?
Gary: Meow!
Karen: [they start to get smushed by Spot] Uh, well, you see, SpongeBob, I didn't program the pill to stop. Ever.
[Plankton's taxi stops in front of the Chum Bucket as it's about to explode.]
Plankton: [walking with doomsday device] I gotta be careful with you. [laughs] One wrong move and you'll blow the whole ocean sky-high. [laughs, notices Spot] Huh?
Spot: [barking happily]
Plankton: Huh, the good times never last. [screams and runs away as the Chum Bucket and Spot crush him] Ouch!
[Spot continues growing, catching the attention of others.]
Citizens: Huh? [murmuring]
Plankton: [escaping Spot] Karen! [SpongeBob, Karen, and Gary come out of spot] None of my sticky notes said to turn Spot into a behemoth!
Karen: Well, this wouldn't have happened if [points to Plankton] you had trained him properly.
Plankton: I'm a busy man. [waves finger at Karen] You should've been following my instructions.
Karen: Excuse me? I am your computer wife, not your computer maid!
Spot: [whimpering]
Karen: [off-screen] I slave all day over a hot keyboard--
[An open shot of Earth is shown as Spot continues to grow larger.]
Plankton: [off-screen] Oh, so everything is my fault! It's all ones and zeroes with you, honey. [being held by Karen] You probably made Spot bigger than me on purpose...
SpongeBob: Ooh! [holds bone] Aha!
Plankton: To make me feel small!
SpongeBob: [calling] Spot?
Spot: [notices bone] Ah!
Karen: Your mouth is the biggest part of you-- [off-screen, Spot gets excited and licks his lips] Everything about you is small.
Plankton: [off-screen, Spot tries to reach for the bone] My heart is big.
Karen: My mother was right, I should not have settled.
SpongeBob: Look!
Karen and Plankton: [look at Spot, Karen's screen turns into a question mark] Huh?
Spot: [barking, pushing towards them]
Karen: Spot! I think he's... dividing.
Plankton: Aww, he doesn't like it when Mommy and Daddy fight. Come on, boy. Come to Papa. Come to Daddy.
Karen: Come on, boy!
SpongeBob: Come on.
Gary: [meowing]
[Spot detatches from his body mass and falls down]
All: Spot!
[Spot lands on top of Plankton.]
Plankton: [picks up Spot] Aww. [gets licked] Aww.
Karen: [picking up Plankton and Spot] Oh, I can't stay mad at these [touches Plankton, screen turns into heart] cute little faces.
Plankton: Well, I'm still a little mad. [Spot licks him, both laugh]
[SpongeBob gives the bone to Spot, and then laughs with others. The citizens of Bikini Bottom look up at Spot's giant mass, which absorbs the sun, making it disappear. The screen fades to black because of the shrinking sun.]",0.24,Danny Giovannini

However, Gary doesn't come, and SpongeBob can't find him. Gary's meow is heard deeply echoing. SpongeBob goes to the toilet and jumps in, but comes out in Squidward's bathroom, seeing him shower. Squidward screams and flushes SpongeBob back down. When SpongeBob arrives home, he sees Gary stuck in the walls of the house. To get into the walls, SpongeBob opens the door on a picture of his parents' house and goes inside. The door closes, leaving him trapped behind the walls.Inside the walls, SpongeBob sees Gary's shadow. A crazed, bearded old man snarls at him, scaring him. However, Gary is safe, and the man gives him a treat. He introduces himself as Wally C., a man who has lived inside the walls for years. He tells SpongeBob that he used to be a handyman, but when two other workers wallpapered the house, they trapped him inside. This happened to be the same house that SpongeBob ended up buying. SpongeBob suggests that he and Wally look for a way out, but Wally tells him there is no escape. He has become accustomed to living there, and offers to give SpongeBob and Gary a tour of ""Wallhalla.""Wally shows SpongeBob and Gary his mold garden, which is under attack by sea urchins. SpongeBob picks up some urchin droppings, which he mistakes for raisins. Next, Wally shows him the ""magic fridge,"" which is the backside of SpongeBob's. SpongeBob tastes some kelp juice, unaware that it is actually from his own fridge. Wally takes SpongeBob to the ""magic medicine cabinet,"" taking out SpongeBob's toothbrush and using it to clean his nose.SpongeBob admires how easy life in Wallhalla must be, but Wally informs him of one problem: a neighbor who walks around with squeaky shoes, shrieks with delight at any time, and has a loud and annoying laugh, which ended up driving him mad. Wally is unaware that this describes SpongeBob, so the two have a ""friendship feast"" together, eating mushrooms and drinking kelp juice. SpongeBob thanks Wally, but says he and Gary are going to look for a way back home. Wally doesn't know who Gary is, and claims that Gary is his pet, based on the writing on Gary's shell. However, he pronounces it as ""ga-RY."" SpongeBob laughs at this mix-up, and the laugh makes Wally realize who he really is. Wally lashes out at him in rage, chasing him down while knocking over pipes and boards that reinforce the walls.Patrick enters the house, where SpongeBob and Wally are chasing each other throughout the walls. Patrick eats from the fridge and watches TV, which SpongeBob and Wally enter, but he ignores them. A package arrives with cookies from SpongeBob's mother. Patrick ""returns"" it by flushing it down the toilet, breaking the packaging and eating the cookies inside. SpongeBob and Wally break through the medicine cabinet, and Wally cries that Wallhalla has been destroyed. SpongeBob comforts him by asking if there was anything he missed from the outside world, and Patrick unwraps a fresh Krabby Patty. Wally admits that he has been rationing an old, moldy Krabby Patty for decades.At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob prepares a giant Krabby Patty. He gives it to Wally, whose hand is sticking out from the floorboards. Wally then travels into the cash register, asking Squidward for mustard. Horrified, Squidward runs out of the restaurant screaming as SpongeBob and Wally laugh, only for Wally to stop and comment that he still hates SpongeBob's laugh.",Wallhalla,"[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house.]

Wally: [shushes him] Ah! Ah! Ah! There be no exit once ye enter this restrictive realm.

SpongeBob: Huh? Ooh! [grabs Wally] Wally, there's a way out!
Wally: [laughs] Nay. That's just the [waves hand] magic fridge.
[Wally opens up the plate, accessing SpongeBob's fridge through the back. He grabs a carton of kelp juice and drinks from it.]
Wally: [sighs]
SpongeBob: [amazed] Magic?
Wally: No matter how much I eat or drink, she always provideth more! [laughs]

SpongeBob: Hey! I get Tender Tummy Kelp Juice, too! Sure tastes better from the magic fridge, though!
Wally: There be many magical crannies in Wallhalla!

[Wally, SpongeBob, and Gary sit around a table, each with a glass and a plate full of garbage. There is a carton of kelp juice on the table. Wally pours some for SpongeBob, and they clink their glasses.]
Wally and SpongeBob: To friendship!
[They drink the kelp juice, then clink two mushrooms together.]
Wally and SpongeBob: To Wallhalla!
[They throw the mushrooms into each other's mouths. They pinch their noses and continue eating. After the meal, they are all fat.]
SpongeBob: Well, that was the friendliest feast I ever had! Welp, guess me and Gary better find our way back home!

SpongeBob: Oh, you know, my pet snail. Gary.
Wally: [blows raspberry] Your pet snail? He be my pet snail! And his name ain't Gary, it's ""gah-REE""! See?

SpongeBob: [swallows] Gulp.
Gary: Meow.
[Wally knocks over the table, sending SpongeBob and Gary to the ground. Pipes burst and emit steam.]
Wally: I curse thee, SpongeBob SquarePants! And that irritating cackle! Now I'm gonna wring the water from your pores!
[SpongeBob screams and runs away with Gary. Wally chases him. SpongeBob ducks through a bunch of pipes, which Wally smashes through, causing the walls to close in.]
Wally: Be gone from Wallhalla! [smashes more] You're breakin' me beautiful world!
[Patrick walks into the house.]
Patrick: [calling out] SpongeBob? You home? Hmmm... [Wally and SpongeBob pass him in the walls in the background] Guess not. Well, su casa ay mi casa !

SpongeBob: Patrick!
Gary: Meowww!
SpongeBob: Help usss!
[Wally chases them away. Patrick is unfazed.]
Patrick: Ugh. This show stinks. [throws droppings] Boo!
[SpongeBob and Wally are fighting over Gary on the TV. A package is pushed through SpongeBob's mail slot.]
Patrick: Oh, the mail is here! [reads it] This isn't for me. [goes to bathroom and puts it in toilet] I'll just return to sender! [hits it rapidly] Go down! [package explodes, revealing cookies inside] Ooh! Not-for-me cookies! [eats out of the box]
[SpongeBob and Gary burst through the mirror, with Wally following. SpongeBob and Gary land in Patrick's arms.]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Thank goodness you're here!
Patrick: Do you mind, SpongeBob? I'm using the bathroom.
Wally: [realizes] Oh, no! I'm through the looking glass! [sees hole in wall] Wallhalla's been destroyed! [points at SpongeBob] Ye ruined me narrow, uncomfortable life! [crying]
Patrick: Who's the crybaby?
SpongeBob: [comforts Wally] Aw, there has to be one thing from the outside world that you miss. Right?
[Patrick takes out and unwraps a Krabby Patty. Wally smells it and approaches him.]
Wally: [hopeful] Why, is that... a Krabby Patty? [Patrick moves it away from him] Okay, I admit there was one thing I missed. I've had to ration this [takes out moldy Krabby Patty] one Krabby Patty for decades! [eats a bit]
SpongeBob: Hmmm. [snaps fingers] I think I have an idea! [sees package in toilet] Uh, Patrick, why are my mom's cookies floating in the toilet?
Patrick: Oh. Because I forgot to flush. [flushes toilet]
[Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob flips a patty, rings the bell, and spins his spatula.]
SpongeBob: Order up! [puts large Krabby Patty on spatula] Or should I say, order down ! [giggles as he drops the Krabby Patty into the floor, where Wally grabs it]
Wally: Thank ye! [moves outside the kitchen and pops out of the cash register, scaring Squidward] Got any mustard?

After attaching his head and taking a ""shower"" by encasing himself in spider silk, he serves blood to Nosferatu, who has been inflicted with a cold. Whenever Nosferatu sneezes, he switches from his human form to his bat form and vice-versa. Slappy puts him in a cage and brings him to Dr. Calimari's Physician. Dr. Calimari decides to steam the allergies out, and tells Slappy to return in two hours once he is better. Nosferatu hypnotizes the doctor into making him bring blood.Slappy rides into Bikini Bottom to kill time. He visits the Fun Arcade and plays a dancing game, wherein all his limbs come off and kick his head into the hoop of a basketball game. Next, Slappy plays a bottle-spraying game at a carnival, but accidentally shoots water into the barker's head and causes him to explode. The barker then throws Slappy at the bottles himself.

The doctor gives Slappy nose drops and gives Nosferatu a lollipop, and they leave the office. Slappy gives Nosferatu his flea collar from the pet store, and the two race each other back home. Nosferatu, as a bat, picks up Slappy and flies away, only for them to both be swallowed by the Moon.",Slappy Daze,"[The episode begins with the sun nearly rising in Bikini Bottom, and then a shot of Nosferatu's castle is shown. Inside, Nosferatu and Slappy are sleeping. Just then, an alarm clock switches from day to night and howls, prompting Slappy to break it with a mallet and climb out of a cupboard he was in. His headless body in pajamas walks in to four identical Slappy heads.]
Slappy heads: Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!
[Slappy picks the third one, puts it on his body, and continues on with his night, as the rest of the heads sigh in disappointment. Slappy proceeds to the bathroom, stretching. There, a sea spider sitting on top of the bath sprays him with its acid, reducing Slappy's head to his skull.]
Slappy: Oh, Esmerelda, good evening.
[Slappy removes his pajamas and enters the bath, as Esmerelda ties him with her web. Slappy then emerges from the web dressed up, exiting the bathroom and heading towards Nosferatu's coffin, holding a plate with blood in a glass and eggs.]
Slappy: [knocks on the coffin] Wakey-wakes, Master. The first blood of the day is the most important. [no one answers] Huh? Master?
[Slappy opens the coffin and gasps upon finding Nosferatu with a runny nose, sneezing and turning into a bat as he does so.]
Slappy: Oh no! You got a stuffy Nose-feratu! [rimshot]
[Nosferatu sneezes and turns back into himself again, but sneezes a second time and turns back into a bat. Just as he's about to sneeze a third time, Slappy puts him in the cage.]
Slappy: We have to get you to Dr. Calimari right away. [exits the castle on a bicycle and drives into a deformed black-and-white building as Nosferatu continues sneezing]
Dr. Calimari: Next patient?
Slappy: Salutations, Dr. Calimari. The Master has a case of the Transylvanian sniff-sniffs. Can you help?
[Nosferatu screeches at Dr. Calimari.]
Dr. Calimari: Thanks you for bringing him in, Slappy. I'll steam those allergies right out of his schnoz.
[A vampire appears from the desk holding a steaming iron, and Nosferatu screeches again.]
Dr. Calimari: Come back in two hours und pick him up.
Slappy: I'll be right back, Master. Oh, I almost forgot. [kisses Nosferatu and giggles eerily, closing the door behind him]

Dr. Calimari: Yes, Master. I will bring you blood samples. Und cookies.
Slappy: Two hours? What am I gonna do for two whole hours? Let's find out, eh? Eh?! [drives into Bikini Bottom]

Game announcer: Get ready to Prance, Prance on Your Grave!
Slappy: Oh, I just love to prance. [starts dancing with the kids] Oh, I feel so free and loose!

Slappy: Oh, hello, Slippy. You look positively disgusting this evening. [laughs eerily]
Slippy: You look pretty horrifying yourself, Slappy. [both exchange laughs] What can I get you today?
Slappy: Oh, I need a can of bat food and a flea collar for the Master.
Slippy: Oh, that Master sure is lucky to have you looking out for him. [gives Slappy a bag with bat food and a flea collar]
Slappy: [blushes and giggles] What do I owe you, gruesome?
Slippy: Shh, it's on the house, stink lips. [winks at him]
Slappy: Until our eyes cross again, mon cheri.
[Slippy leans in for a kiss, until Slappy slides out of the store and SpongeBob appears.]
SpongeBob: [holding Gary] Excuse me, do you sell snail diapers?
[Slippy kisses Gary instead, as SpongeBob looks to the audience disgusted. Transition to the cemetery, where Slappy sits on the ground with a picnic basket.]
Slappy: Ah, it is always great to go on a picnic with old friends. [knocks on a grave] Oh, Mr. Ribeye! Mr. Ribeye, do you have the time?
[Mr. Ribeye's skeleton hand with a watch on it emerges from the ground, showing Slappy the time.]

Slappy: Dr. Calimari, I'm back.
Dr. Calimari: Nosferatu... Nosferatu...
Slappy: So tell me, doctor, is the Master cured?
Dr. Calimari: [snaps out of his hypnotized state] All better! Make sure he takes these nose drops twice a night.
Slappy: Oh, thank you, Dr. C!

[Nosferatu puts on the collar and starts posing.]
Slappy: Very fetching, Master. [many fleas fly out of Nosferatu as Slappy catches them and puts them on a sandwich] I'll put them in a fridge for later.

While Squidward imagines himself at a resort, he notices the trip includes his family, which SpongeBob and Patrick have registered themselves as.SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are seen waiting in line at Bikini Bottom Airport. When called up, Squidward shows his ticket, and he is announced as the contest winner. The three then get their ""family"" picture taken. While on the plane, Squidward is assigned to sit between SpongeBob and Patrick, to which he tries to move to the aisle seat, but is forced back to his assigned seat by the flight attendant. The plane soon takes off after SpongeBob and Patrick overly strap their seatbelts on. They switch seats just before the plane gains altitude, much to Squidward’s annoyance.SpongeBob and Patrick run down the plane aisle, before eventually falling asleep, but Squidward, still awake, begins to cry. Patrick ends up needing to use the bathroom later on. Trying to find one, he opens a door that sends two flight attendants falling out of the plane. Squidward, still tangled to his seatbelt, tries to get the flight attendants' help, but he only gets Patrick, who now is a flight attendant. Patrick forcefully pours coffee into Squidward's mouth. SpongeBob notices Patrick is now a flight attendant, and Patrick makes him one too.Squidward is freed from his seat after SpongeBob dries the coffee off him. SpongeBob and Patrick serve snacks down the aisle and end up crashing into each other, as well as Squidward. Infuriated, Squidward tries to speak to the captains in complaint, but Patrick opens a door that sends them falling out of the plane. Squidward panics, now seeing no one flying the plane. He presses a button, but it sends the plane falling. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward see Bora Bora Bottom in sight, and the former two encourage the latter to land the plane.Squidward makes a successful landing to Bora Bora Bottom and gets ready to enjoy the resort. Soon after, however, the plane travels in reverse, with SpongeBob revealing that the plane was traveling on auto-pilot. Squidward tries to get off the plane to stay at the resort, but SpongeBob explains that the trip was only to see the resort briefly, and not actually spend time there for a vacation. The plane ascends into the sky, and SpongeBob and Patrick announce and laugh on the speaker, with Squidward screaming in agony, as the episode ends.",Plane to Sea,"[The episode starts with SpongeBob's, Squidward's, and Patrick's houses in the morning.]
Squidward: [opens his door] Ah, what a beautiful morning! Time to check the mail and sees who loves you, Squidward.
[As he opens his mailbox, SpongeBob and Patrick's butts come out.]
Squidward: [sighs in disappointment] I wonder if I can return to sender? [walks behind his mailbox and slaps it, causing SpongeBob and Patrick to come out entirely. They both spit out his mail]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Good morning, Squidward!
Squidward: Well, I'm going back to bed now, forever.
[As Squidward walks back into his house to open his door, SpongeBob and Patrick come out and they both giggle.]
SpongeBob: [holding an opened envelope with a rolled paper stick out of it] Aren't you gonna open your mail?
Squidward: [grabs the envelope] Give me that! It looks like you already did! [walks back into his house and opens the paper. After doing so, confetti comes out] I won something? But, I didn't enter any contest!
SpongeBob: It's an all-expenses paid trip to see beautiful Bora Bora Bottom! We entered it for you! And only 6,000 times, too!
Squidward: Wow. [a life-action beach at sunset appears behind him] Me, a winner, at a tropical resort. [continues reading the paper] Let's see, the winning family will board at Bikini Bottom Airport, and--- wait a minute. [the background shatters] ""Winning family""?
SpongeBob: Oh, did we forget to mention?
Squidward: Oh, no. [the scene transitions into the airport] I cannot believe I let you bottomfeeders talked me into this.

Clerk: Come on, dad! Let's get a picture of you and the kids for our [carries SpongeBob and Patrick to Squidward for him to carry] in-flight magazine!

Clerk: Okay everybody, say ""I love my family.""
Squidward: [as Patrick continues crying] I'd rather not.
Clerk: [aggressively] Say it!
SpongeBob and Squidward: [elatedly and monotonously, respectively] I love my family.

SpongeBob: And I'll take the aisle! [laughs]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Daddy's in the middle!
Squidward: Oh, no! I am not suffering a whole flight between you two barnacle brains! At least give me the aisle! [moves SpongeBob to the middle seat so he can move to the aisle]
Flight attendant: [tapping Squidward's elbow] Excuse me sir. Are you in your assigned seat? [cracks her knuckles]
[Squidward gulps. He moves SpongeBob back to the aisle, and him to the middle seat. The flight attendant does the ""I'm watching you"" sign to Squidward and slides off-screen.]
Second flight attendant: OK, everybody, please fasten your seatbelts by adjusting this easy-to-pull strap! [Squidward puts it on]
Flight attendant: Make sure it's nice and [pulls the strap, causing Squidward to be strained] tight! And keep your seat in the [smashes Squidward to a seat] upright position! Or else.
Squidward: Okay.
[SpongeBob puts the seatbelt through his pores. He eventually tangles himself. Patrick ties it around his neck and clicks it on. He pulls the strap and chokes himself.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, wanna switch so I can look out the window?
Patrick: Okay, but hurry!
[As they are trying to switch seats, this causes Squidward to be trapped by three of the seatbelts. Squidward growls.]
Pilot: Uh, attention all passengers, this is your, uh, captain speaking, please keep your, uh, [the plane starts flying upwards] seatbelts on fastened as we, uh, gain altitude.
[SpongeBob and Patrick begin to fall uncontrollably. They hang onto a seatbelt and eventually fall down. The plane starts flying normally. A sign that shows passengers to unclick their seatbelts is then shown.]
Pilot: Enjoy your flight, you may now roam around the, uh, cabin.
SpongeBob: [running] Hear that, Squidward? You can take your seatbelt off now!
Squidward: Wait, untie me!
[As SpongeBob and Patrick run through the plane, they push some passengers.]
Patrick: [notices a oxygen bag] Oh, boy! A feed bag! [as he starts inhaling from the bag, his body starts inflating and exhales, hitting other passengers]
French Narrator: [reading timecard] Twelve sleepless hours later...
[Squidward begins whimpering, and then bursts into tears, bawling.]
Baby kid: Keep it down, will ya? I'm trying to sleep! [hits Squidward on the head with her rattle. He sighs]
Patrick: Oh. I dreamt I was in the ocean, and now I gotta pee! [runs to the end of the plane to see two doors: one for the bathroom and one for the exit] Huh? Um... [looks at the two doors] Huh? Uh.. [interrupted by the flight attendant] Ah!
Second flight attendant: Can I help you with something?
Patrick: Yeah, I gotta use the bathroom! [opens the exit door, causing the second flight attendant and his red cap to fly out]
Second flight attendant: Ahh!...
Patrick: [closes the door] Rude! I was here first.
Second flight attendant: [screaming as she falls, then she pulls a parachute which was in her hat] Oh! [pulls out a book to read while humming]
Flight attendant: Hey buddy, what happened to the other flight attendant?
Patrick: She's in the bathroom. [opens the exit door again, causing the flight attendant to fly out] See?
Flight attendant: Ah, wha...!
Patrick: [closes the door again, and the flight attendant's hat lands on his head] Ooh!
Flight attendant: [screaming as she falls, then she holds onto the second flight attendant's legs. She shrugs at her]
Squidward: [straining to get out of the seat, then he mumbles. He notices something] Huh? The flight attendants will save me! [tries to press the button with his nose] Just need to... hit that call button! [his nose grows a finger and presses the button. He sighs in relief]
Patrick: Good evening, Mr. Sir! Fresh coffee?
Squidward: What, Patrick? Where are the real flight attendants?
Patrick: They've been in the bathroom for a while. [whispering] I think they had too much coffee. [normally] Now how about that coffee?
Squidward: No, I don't want- [Patrick grabs his nose and holds it, along with Squidward's head, upwards. He pours coffee into his mouth]
Patrick: Wow, Squidward, you really like coffee!
[The plane shakes, causing the coffee jug to land in Squidward's mouth.]
Pilot: Uh, folks, sorry about that turbulence.
SpongeBob: [a cabinet door opens and he is revealed to be inside it] Wow, Patrick! They made you a flight attendant?
Patrick: Yuh-huh! Hey, you wanna be one too?
SpongeBob: [cheers in excitement and comes out of the cabinet]
Patrick: [throws a hand towel into his mouth and chews it into a flight attendant hat. He puts the hat onto SpongeBob's head with his tongue. They both laugh until they hear Squidward mumbling]
SpongeBob: Ooh, our apologies, sir! Let's get you dried off, hm? [presses an air conditioner button]
[The air conditioner causes Squidward to spit out the coffee jug and eventually blow him and the seats away. Squidward appears to now be untangled from the seat.]
Squidward: [groans and shakes the coffee off his head] Huh? I'm free! I'm free!
SpongeBob: Snack time! [laughs while passing out snacks and moving the cart]
[Squidward tries to run the other way but Patrick is also passing out snacks while on the cart moving.]
Patrick: Whee!
Squidward: Oh, no...
[SpongeBob and Patrick crash into him. He is revealed to be trapped in the two carts]
Squidward: That's it! I am filing a complaint with the captain! [moves his head to a different drawer] Roll me to the front of the plane.

Squidward: [stretches himself out of the cart and grumbles to the pilot door. He opens it]
Pilot: Arrrrrre you enjoying your flight?
Squidward: No, I am not! These two have been nothing but trouble since we took off! [camera cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob falls while Patrick scratches his butt] And now they've replaced the flight attendants!
Co-pilot: Uh, what did they do with them?
Patrick: [walking to an exit door] I just opened the bathroom door, captain. Like this! [opens the door, causing the two pilots to fly out. They ""scream"" until they pull parachutes in their pants]
Squidward: [looks inside the door and notices something] There's no one flying the plane! [screams, then looks around the cabin while panicking] What are we gonna do?!
Patrick: Oh, we're gonna crash.
Squidward: [walks to controls] Uh, I guess I can figure this out. How hard can it be? [grabs ahold of the throttle then looks at the rest of the controls. He shakes his head]
SpongeBob: Squidward, [rubbing his head] trust your instincts!
Squidward: I suppose, uh... [presses a button on the throttle]
[The plane starts flying downward, and SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick are screaming. A cloud reveals that Bora Bora Bottom is down below.]
SpongeBob: Look, Squidward! We're almost there! Now all you gotta do this land this thing!
Patrick: And not kill everyone!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are chanting Squidward's name while he presses random buttons, which causes the plane to crash on some flower clouds. Two flower clouds that resemble hands ties the plane into a knot. The plane spins itself and continues going downwards. SpongeBob and Patrick continue chanting Squidward's name while he tries to land. The plane brings out its wheels and eventually lands on the road to Bora Bora Bottom. Squidward screams until the plane stops. The camera pans out to a view of Bora Bora Bottom.]
SpongeBob: [while Patrick cheering] Whoo-hoo! Yay, Squidward!
Squidward: Huh? [while looking out the window] Bora Bora Bottom! [runs to put beach attire on. He squirts sunscreen on his nose, and grabs the speaker.  He clears his throat] Uh, attention passengers, this is your new captain speaking. We have arrived at beautiful Bora Bora Bottom! Ha! [the plane starts moving backwards] Wha, huh? [notices Bora Bora Bottom fading away] Wait a minute! I thought I stopped this thing!
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Squidward, look! [the camera pans to an auto-pilot button, which is on] It was on auto-pilot the whole time.
Patrick: Yay, Squidward! You did nothing! [laughs a bit]
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh as Squidward approaches the exit door on the plane.]
Squidward: No, no! [panics] I need to get off this plane and enjoy the resort!
SpongeBob: [opens the door] Now, why would you wanna do that? [laughs] You won a trip to see Bora Bora Bottom, not stay there, silly!
Patrick: And there it goes.
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob: Ah, life is funny, isn't it?
[The plane's fire engine is shown, a sign is shown for passengers to click their seatbelts on, and the plane starts flying upwards, causing Squidward to lose gravity and fall to the end of the plane. He crashes onto a door.]
Speaker: This is your flight attendant speaking. [the speaker forms into Patrick's mouth] Looks like we're experiencing some headwinds. And the present estimate for our return flight to Bikini Bottom is 24 hours! [the speaker then forms SpongeBob's mouth as both mouths begin to laugh]

He later watches TV and gets an idea to join the League of E.V.I.L.Plankton tries different costumes until Karen gives a green thumbs up. Plankton then goes to find the secret lair which happens to be accessible by going through a dumpster. Once there, there are many wanting to join the force in a subtle way. They try out but they fail for entering the team. Plankton says he for all intents and purposes wants to really steal the formula for world domination. They decide to choose Plankton to join the force in a big way. With Plankton in the force, they commit many sorts of evil acts in a subtle way.First, they go to Super Weenie Hut Jr's, where they want to grab lunch. Plankton heads into the restaurant for lunch. When he gets there, the server notices that he is a villain and calls for security. Amid the chaos, Plankton steals food to bring back. E.V.I.L is grateful for Plankton providing lunch.The villains next want Plankton to take a bag with flames and set it on the doorstep of The Foot, who the villains want to get revenge on. When Plankton sets the fire on the doorstep, he knocks on the door, causing The Foot to come out and accidentally step on Plankton and the bag. But when Plankton tries to crawl out of the bottom of The Foot, the house explodes, even The Foot. Plankton had a Chum Mix in the bag which caused the house and The Foot to explode. Because of this, Plankton was welcomed to the club. The villains ask Plankton what to do next. Plankton has an idea for everyone.They come to the Krusty Krab and the staff is surprised they came. Dirty Bubble traps SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs as a distraction. Plankton steals the formula, but E.V.I.L finds out that the formula is just a recipe for a sandwich. They get disappointed, give the formula back to Mr. Krabs, and kick Plankton out of the force. And in the process, trapping him in hot sauce.",Captain Pipsqueak,"[The episode opens at the Chum Bucket. Karen is slicing a cucumber, humming a tune.]
Karen: ♪ La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da ♪
[Distant screaming is heard coming from Plankton.]
Karen: Uh-oh. Incoming.
[Plankton screams and groans as he is thrown from the Krusty Krab and back into the Chum Bucket. Mr. Krabs laughs at him from the exit.]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Plankton, you're a hot mess. Serves ya right, fer tryin' to steal me formular, for the gazillionth time.
Plankton: I'll have my revenge! Mark my words! [shakes fist, arm falls off] Aw, come on.
[Mr. Krabs continues laughing.]
Plankton: This isn't over!
[Plankton grunts as Karen grabs him.]
Karen: Hard day at work? I know what you need.
[Karen puts Plankton in a spa bath. Plankton screams mildly in discomfort.]
Plankton: Ahh! [gasps. He sighs, whimpers, and starts to cry. He sobs] Oh, Karen, I'm never gonna get that Krabby Patty formula! [sniffles, and takes the cucumber slice off his eye. His eye sticks on the cucumber] Oops. [swallows the eye and it grows back. He chews on the cucumber slice] Mmm, not bad.
[Plankton leans back onto the spa tub, grabs the TV remote, and turns on the television. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy is on. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are tied up by chains and about to be dipped in a pit of lava. The members of E.V.I.L. laugh.]
E.V.I.L.: [laughter]
Man Ray: Enjoy your molten face peels!
Narrator: Holy clambake! Are Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy about to become hero flambé cooked by Man Ray and his criminal posse of E.V.I.L.?
Plankton: I hope so! I love it when the villains gain the upper hand. [laughs]
Narrator: As our heroes face certain doom, the villains escape to their secret underground lair!
E.V.I.L: [laughing]
[The members of E.V.I.L. jump into a dumpster and flush themselves down.]
Plankton: Of course! All I need to do is join the criminals of E.V.I.L.! They'll help me defeat Krabs.
Karen: Smart thinking. [comes with a towel] You can go as ""Towel Man.""
Plankton: Don't be a wisenheimer. [comes out of the tub. His butt shows] I can't accessorize this old rag. [uses the towel to cover himself] I need a real costume.
[Bubble transition. Circus music plays as a red curtain opens.]
Plankton: [comes out with a clown costume, holding a pie bomb] Eh?
Karen: [buzzes with a thumbs down]
Plankton: Aw. [blows the candle on the pie bomb, which causes it to explode] Ah! [hisses as he comes out with a spider costume]
Karen: [buzzes with a thumbs down]
Plankton: [growls and snarls. His teeth fall out. The teeth roar and chase him] Ah! [bubble transition. Plankton comes out with a purple costume and laughs]
Karen: [dings with a thumbs up]
Plankton: [smiles and walks, but then trips and groans] Maybe a shorter cape. [bubble transition]
[A bus drives and stops at a dumpster. Plankton walks out of the bus, and the bus leaves.]
Plankton: This must be the entrance to their secret lair. A little dumpster dive, and I'm in. [Plankton jumps into the dumpster. He puts his head out of the trash and swims through it, looking for the door. He strains and groans.] Where's the door? [He looks out of the dumpster and stares at something in surprise.] Ooh?
[A blinking neon sign points to the E.V.I.L. lair, which is in the dumpster right next to Plankton.]
Plankton: Wrong dumpster. [sighs] Of course.
[bubble transition to an underground cavern]
Plankton: [walks into the E.V.I.L. lair] Hello? [laughs] I'm here to join the forces of E.V.I.L.!
[Plankton walks into the audition room, and Dennis appears handing Plankton a clipboard.]
Dennis: Dude.
Plankton: Huh, wha-?
Dennis: Sign in and wait your turn.
Villain: Red leather, yellow leather!
[The villains are standing on stage and reading scripts, reciting lines.]
Thief: Get out of the car, fellas!
Sticky Fins Whiting: Take all your money and put it in the bag!
Dr. Negative: No, Mr. Bob. I expect you to fry! [cackles]
Madame Hagfish: When the full moon rises...
Earworm: [speaking lines]
Tattletale Strangler: I am the Strangler! [clears throat] I'm the Strangler!
Robot Mantis: [growling]
Prawn: What is this yellow thing? Some kind of mold?
DoodleBob: [babbling]
Dorsal Dan: To be or--line!
Gordon: [throws his paper and uses a mallet to smash a watermelon] Ha.
[The villains chatter on-stage. Man Ray, the Dirty Bubble, the Jumbo Shrimp, and Notodoris are in the audience.]
Man Ray: We've got quite an impressive rogues gallery up there, eh? [stands up] Thank you for taking time out of your scandalous schedules to try out for E.V.I.L. As you all know, [Nosferatu, Madame Hagfish, and the Strangler are on the stage] we can only pick one new villain to join Team E.V.I.L., so let the judging begin! [gets a clipboard and covers his eyes with a blindfold] Eeny, meeny, miney--- [grunts] Nosferatu!
Nosferatu: [hisses and comes forward]
[The Tattletale Strangler shoves Nosferatu out of the way.]
Tattletale Strangler: No way, Man Ray! I was first!
Man Ray: [takes out ray gun] First to go bye-bye. [cackles]
Tattletale Strangler: Huh? [screams and gets zapped, then disintegrates into ash]
Dr. Negative: Egad!
[The villains gasp.]
Man Ray: [blows on the ray and puts it down] Nosferatu, proceed.
[Nosferatu hands Gramma a book of sheet music. She opens it and begins playing ominous piano music. Nosferatu strikes multiple poses. E.V.I.L. is unimpressed.]
Man Ray: Mime? Mime is his evil power?
[Nosferatu gets blasted with Man Ray's ray gun and disintegrates.]
Man Ray: [reading clipboard] Robot Mantis!
[The Robot Mantis gives Gramma some music. She plays upbeat ragtime music and he starts dancing. He whittles away the piano, into a cello, a violin, a banjo, and a kazoo.]
Robot Mantis: [panting] Ta-da!
Man Ray: How dare you! We just had that piano tuned!
[He blasts the Robot Mantis with a ray gun. He falls over and explodes.]
Man Ray: [with blindfold, pointing at clipboard] Eeny, meeny, miney-- [grunts] Sheldon J. Plankton?
[Gramma plays ""Taps"" on kazoo. Plankton jumps on it.]
Plankton: Thanks, ma'am, but, uh, music won't be necessary. [jumps off the kazoo]
Man Ray: Right. So what's your supervillain power, little guy?
Plankton: Well, I'd venture to say it would be my massive, evil intellect. [shines a flashlight to show his brain taking up much of his body]
Man Ray: Impressive. So where do you see yourself in the next five years?
Plankton: Well, [shows screen of the Krabby Patty secret formula bottle in its safe] once I finally have the secret formula... [shows footage of a screaming crowd running as building burns] The post-apocalyptic global empire of destruction that results will be mine, [shows slide of Plankton sitting on a throne atop a pile of skulls and bones] and I'll be sitting pretty on a pile of your bones! [cackles]
Man Ray: That sounds pretty villainous. Okay, you'll move on to the test phase. But first, you'll need a proper supervillain name. [to Jumbo Shrimp] How about ""Mr. Green Bean""?
Notodoris: Ooh, the ""Itsy Bitsy Green Guy.""
Man Ray: No, too long. [bell dings] How about ""Captain Pipsqueak""?
Jumbo Shrimp: Yeah!
Notodoris: I love it!
Dirty Bubble: [laughing]
Man Ray: That settles it. Captain Pipsqueak!
[The members of E.V.I.L. run on stage and lift Plankton up.]
E.V.I.L.: Captain Pipsqueak!
Plankton: We can tweak that later, right? [screams as they drop him]
Man Ray: Okay, team, let's test Captain Pipsqueak's villainy in the real world!
[Bubble transition to Super Weenie Hut Jr's. We see E.V.I.L. gathered around a table on top of a small hill next to the restaurant.]
Man Ray: Your first test is to get us lunch: a 25-pound bucket from Weenie Hut Jr.! [cackles]
Jumbo Shrimp: With Evil sauce.
Notodoris: Extra Evil sauce.
Plankton: Odd caper, but no problemo! [He grunts and jumps off. Cut to him ringing the bell inside the restaurant.] I need a 25-pound Weenie bucket, please, and make it [snaps] snappy! Oh, and extra Evil sauce.
Mister Wiener: Hey, I know that order. You're one of those E.V.I.L. guys. [points to a sign with E.V.I.L.'s faces and the caption ""No Food for E.V.I.L. -- Never Ever!""] You're all banned!
Plankton: Just give me my order, [points] or you'll know the meaning of fear!
Mister Wiener: [whistles] Security! We got a small problem here.
[Two hot dog goons walk up and beat up Plankton. He jumps out of the resulting fight cloud. E.V.I.L. waits for their food.]
Notodoris: So boring.
Man Ray: Short legs. We should've known better.
Jumbo Shrimp: I'm starving here! What are the chances he gets our food?
Man Ray: Slim to none, I'm guessing.
Plankton: [off-screen] Hello? [pushes the weenie bucket up the hill] Could somebody help me with this? [They grab the hot dogs and eat them. Plankton jumps onto the table and takes out a bottle of sauce.] Oh, and extra Evil sauce.
Notodoris: Wicked.
Jumbo Shrimp: Awesome.
Man Ray: A weenie toast to Captain Pipsqueak!
E.V.I.L.: Pip pip hooray!
[They smash their hot dogs into Plankton, making him dizzy. Bubble transition to E.V.I.L. outside a house.]
Man Ray: Okay, Cap, [holds a bag and lights it on fire with his laser vision] take this bag of snail droppings and leave it on that doorstep over there. [Plankton takes the bag] It's the house of the Foot. He's a superhero do-gooder [shakes fists] who deserves our worst. [points] Go!
[Plankton giggles, sets the flaming bag on the welcome mat, and knocks on the house. As he tries to run away, a giant blue foot with a cape steps on him.]
Plankton: [screams and crawls away]
[E.V.I.L. laughs. The house suddenly explodes.]
Plankton: Yes! [cackles] I added a little of my own special Chum Mix to the bag.
Man Ray: Captain Pipsqueak, welcome to E.V.I.L., which stands for...
E.V.I.L.: [high fiving Plankton] Every Villain Is Lemons! Yeah!
Notodoris: So Captain Pipsqueak, what's next? [cackles]
Plankton: Follow me... to world domination! [cackles]
[Transition to the Krusty Krab. Man Ray blasts a hole in the ceiling with his ray gun and enters.]
Man Ray: [laughs]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs!
Krabs: [opens the door and slams it on SpongeBob] What now, boy? [puts hands on his head] Shiver me's lumbers!
[Bubbles come out of the exhaust pipe in the kitchen and float past Squidward, turning into the Dirty Bubble.]
Dirty Bubble: [laughing]
[The Jumbo Shrimp smashes the windows with his glass and enters. Notodoris slithers through the floorboards.]
Notodoris: [laughing]
[Plankton walks in through the front door and laughs. E.V.I.L. walk to the front of the restaurant. Man Ray takes a woman's drink and sips it. Jumbo Shrimp flips a table. Man Ray holds out Plankton to Krabs.]
Plankton: You might as well give us the secret formula now, Krabs. I'm the new mastermind of E.V.I.L.!
Krabs: [laughs] What, you nerds going to a comic convention?
SpongeBob: Ooh, that is a nice costume, Plankton! [laughs]
Plankton: The name is Captain Pipsqueak to you. Get 'em!
[The Dirty Bubble laughs and swallows up Krabs, SpongeBob, and Squidward.]
Squidward: Dirty Bubble? [pulls on his shirt, which is stained] But I just did my laundry!
Krabs: Thieves! [bangs fists against the Dirty Bubble] Keep yer filthy, rotten mitts offa me formular!
[Man Ray goes into Krabs' office, blasts his desk and chair, then blasts the same and takes out the secret formula. Plankton stands on a table and laughs. Man Ray brings it over to him.]
Plankton: [laughs] Yes! Yes!
[Man Ray opens the formula bottle and reads the formula.]
Man Ray: Huh? This isn't the formula for world domination. It's a recipe for a sandwich! How does that work?
Plankton: Uh, well, with that, I can put this guy [Krabs is growling inside the Dirty Bubble] outta business.
[Notodoris and Jumbo Shrimp are eating Krabby Patties.]
Jumbo Shrimp: Mmm, why would we ever wanna do that? These Krabby Patties taste great!
Notodoris: Yeah, mmm.
[The Dirty Bubble spits out SpongeBob, Krabs, and Squidward and goes to eat a Krabby Patty. Man Ray returns the formula in its bottle.]
Man Ray: Here you go, boss. Sorry about that. Keep up the good work. I can't believe this lousy pipsqueak...
Plankton: Huh?
Man Ray: Wasted our time!
[E.V.I.L. surrounds Plankton.]
Jumbo Shrimp: Some criminal genius he is!
Notodoris: Right? ""Massive evil intellect,"" my eye!
Plankton: Nyah! [gets grabbed by Man Ray and dropped in the bottle of Evil sauce]
Narrator: Holy habanero! Is Plankton forever doomed to be bound by a bottle? Grounded in glass? [Plankton screams and the bottle lights on fire] No! Enveloped by extra Evil sauce!
[E.V.I.L. laughs as Plankton burns. Krabs suddenly grabs the bottle.]
Krabs: No outside condirments!
[He throws the bottle in the trash, which SpongeBob is holding. They walk away contently. Zoom in on the trash can.]

The mailman approaches him and gives Squidward mail after he accidentally sprays him. Squidward checks the letter and sees that it is actually for Nosferatu. He tries to throw it away but stuffs it inside SpongeBob, who is inside the trash can. SpongeBob, who was doing some spring cleaning, says that Squidward should deliver the letter to Nosferatu, since he considers it a federal crime to throw other people's mail away. Squidward agrees to deliver the mail, and SpongeBob tags along. Squidward opens his closet to reveal that he has years' worth of Nosferatu's mail mistakenly delivered to him.SpongeBob and Squidward travel on their way to Nosferatu's castle. An innkeeper tries to warn them, but a coachman shows up with a carriage and gives them a ride. Squidward knocks on Nosferatu's door, to which it opens after Squidward tries to leave. Soon after SpongeBob and Squidward enter, Nosferatu is seen flickering the lights, and Slappy shows up underneath him. Nosferatu goes through the mail and eats the Blood of the Month crate. SpongeBob and Slappy laugh, with Squidward and Nosferatu being unamused. SpongeBob and Squidward try to leave, but Slappy will not let them, claiming the rain is not optimal for them. Nosferatu and Slappy invite SpongeBob and Squidward to have dinner and spend the night with them.It is revealed that Slappy tricked SpongeBob and Squidward, using a raincloud powered by a light. Slappy shows them the food served at the dinner, which Squidward is disgusted by this. Squidward requests for ketchup on the mummy fingers, and SpongeBob while serving it, gets some on Squidward's face. While Nosferatu approaches Squidward, SpongeBob gets some ketchup on him. SpongeBob and Squidward are later shown in bed. They try to sleep, but SpongeBob keeps leaving the bedroom to do things he forgot. While SpongeBob is absent from the room, Nosferatu shows up through a wall and tries to attack Squidward, disappearing when SpongeBob enters the bedroom.SpongeBob and Squidward soon notice Nosferatu in the wall, and he tries to approach them, causing them to flee the room in horror. While SpongeBob and Squidward try to escape, Slappy shows up and tries to attack them, but Squidward sprays him. SpongeBob and Squidward check various doors to leave the castle, but they see several scary things inside them. SpongeBob and Squidward jump into the laundry chute and end up inside Nosferatu's coffin room. Slappy shows up and tells them that Nosferatu would be very unhappy to find them there. Nosferatu suddenly appears in another coffin, right next to SpongeBob and Squidward.SpongeBob and Squidward think Nosferatu is about to attack them, but Slappy claims that he just wanted to return mail to Squidward. Nosferatu gives Squidward his package, which is garlic. Nosferatu hisses at the garlic, but Slappy says that he is only joking about him not liking it. They all laugh as the lights flicker again. The flickering is revealed to be coming from the Phantom of the Opera. Everyone laughs as Slappy's head falls off from the screen's iris out.",Squidferatu,"[The episode opens with some sea urchins playing in Squidward's flower garden. One of them bites into a flower, and begins slurping it with another urchin. Then, a shadowy figure looms over the urchins, making them all scream as a green cloud covers them. The figure is revealed to just be Squidward using pest spray while wearing a gas mask. The urchins all cough and move away from the flower bed.]
Squidward: [pulls up mask] Biting my begonias, eh? Not on my watch! [laughs]
Mailman: [yelling in Squidward's face] Mailman!
Squidward: [spraying mailman] Wha--?
Mailman: [eyes shrivel, screams as he hands an envelope to Squidward and walks away]
Squidward: Oh, a letter. Uh, thank you! [reading envelope, woman screams] Nosferatu? [lightning crashes] Huh? What? [sighs] I got his mail by mistake again! [grumbles and approaches trash cans] I'll just file that in here. [opens trash can lid and shoves letter into SpongeBob's mouth, chuckles and walks off before realizing] Huh?

SpongeBob: [cheering through muffled speech]
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [muffled speech]
Squidward: [pulls letter out of SpongeBob's mouth] What are you doing in my garbage?
[SpongeBob bends Squidward's nose and puts a bucket on it. He stands on Squidward with a mop.]
SpongeBob: [singing] ♪ Spring cleaning! ♪ But, Squidward, [takes letter] for shame. [tosses mop] You can't just throw out the mail of Nosferatu. [lightning crashes]
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob: You have to deliver it yourself. [gasps] Otherwise, it'd be a federal crime! And I'll be [prison bars drop] an accessory! [hyperventilating]
Squidward: [pulls SpongeBob off of him and holds him] All right, already! [sets SpongeBob down] I'll take it to him.
SpongeBob: [jumps] Hooray!
Squidward: [shoves letter to SpongeBob] But you are carrying the mail. [goes inside his house]
SpongeBob: Ha! [twirls letter on his finger] One little letter? No problemo.
Squidward: [opening door to his closet] Hold on. There's more.
SpongeBob: [mail lands on ground] Ooh!
Squidward: Here's the rest of it. [uses mop to pull back rest of mail] I have been getting that creepy guy's mail by mistake for years!
SpongeBob: [emerges reading something, gasps] Squidward, look! [holding up magazines] ""Bleeder's Digest."" ""Bat Fancy."" [holds up locked crate with shoe] ""Blood of the Month Club."" [blood squelches]
Squidward: Eh.
SpongeBob: [emerges behind Squidward] Squidward, do you know what this means?
Squidward: [pushes SpongeBob backwards] No.
SpongeBob: It means somebody is going to be very happy to get all their mail, somebody named... [staring, eyes speak] Nosferatu. [lightning crashes]
Squidward: Ah! Huh? What? What was that? Stop looking at me.
[Bubble transition to a different location, which has a sepia tone to it. The camera zooms in on Nosferatu's castle before quickly zooming out to SpongeBob and Squidward carrying a bag of mail.]
Squidward: [whistling, wolf howls]
[A lady shuts her window as they walk by.]
Squidward: [reading map] Well, this is the address. [gets smushed by mail bag and gets stuck in it, grunts]
SpongeBob: [eyes reflect Nosferatu's castle as he looks at it] Ooh! That castle is so high! [mail bag gets put in his mouth, to which he eats it and pops it out to start carrying it again]
Squidward: [continues walking while whistling]
[An inkeeper runs into Squidward, panicked.]
Innkeeper: [grabbing onto Squidward] Please, I beg you, [points to Nosferatu's castle] do not go to the castle! The master is a vampire! He means to suck your blood! [sobs on ground]
Squidward: What are you talking about?
Innkeeper: Nosferatu! [lightning crashes]
Squidward: Mm-hmm.
SpongeBob: [laughs]
Squidward: Right. [walks past innkeeper] I'm sorry. I don't have any spare change.
Innkeeper: [stopping in front of them] Don't go to the castle! Don't go to the castle! Don't go-- [gets run over by a skeleton horse pulling a carriage]
Creepy coachman: [pats carriage, opening stairs which crush the inkeeper]
Squidward: Ah! Well, a coach to the castle. How elegant. [walks forward, then SpongeBob follows] Step lively, SpongeBob.
[Squidward enters the carriage, and SpongeBob puts the mail bag in the back. SpongeBob enters as well, and the steps are lifted. SpongeBob looks at the innkeeper.]
Innkeeper: [lifting head up, injured] The castle!
SpongeBob: Aw. [holds Krabby Patty] Looks like someone could use a Krabby Patty. [feeds innkeeper patty, moving his mouth to chew it]
Innkeeper: [weakly gives thumbs up]
[The carriage moves onward to Nosferatu's castle. SpongeBob and Squidward move from side to side in the carriage, bumping into the walls, as it moves across the sharp corners. They then go around some curves, making SpongeBob and Squidward move in the carriage again.]
SpongeBob: [spinning in air] Whoo! Whoo!
[SpongeBob and Squidward's body parts move all over the place in the carriage like pinballs as it continues moving forward. They finally arrive at the castle, and Squidward falls out of the carriage in pieces.]
Squidward: [standing up] We're taking the bus on the way home! [inhales and sucks his nose back in]
SpongeBob: [tosses the mail bag directly onto Squidward, which floats in place]
Squidward: Huh? Hmm.
[SpongeBob gets off the carriage, and the creepy coachman hisses at them as he leaves. The carriage turns into a bat and flies away. The mail bag crushes SpongeBob and Squidward, to which Squidward gets out from it and knocks on the door with the door decoration.]
Squidward: Hello, Nosferatu? [lightning crashes, looks around] Hmm. [walks away] Well, looks like nobody's home. [door opens] Of course.
[Squidward peeks inside to reveal the interior of Nosferatu's castle, which causes some jellyfish bats to fly away.]
Squidward: Hello? [hesitantly walks inside] We're just here to drop off your mail.
SpongeBob: [almost falling on Squidward] Whoa! [Squidward shoves him]
Squidward: [lightning crashes, causing him to scream and grab onto the mail bag] What's happening?
Nosferatu: [repeatedly flickering light switch, snickering]
SpongeBob: Aw! It's just Nosferatu! [lightning crashes]
Squidward: [gets off, wipes sweat off forehead] Whew!
Nosferatu: [flies over to them, hisses]
Squidward: [screams]
[Slappy slithers down from Nosferatu.]
Slappy: [bowing] The master bids you welcome, and he thanks you for dropping off his mail. [chuckles]
Squidward: Oh.
[Nosferatu rips open the mail bag SpongeBob is holding, revealing the bloody crate, which he picks up and swallows. He rubs his belly, burps, and gets red with embarrassment.]
Slappy: [laughs]
SpongeBob: [laughs]
Slappy: [laughs]
SpongeBob: [laughs, flips head while moving feet]
[SpongeBob and Slappy continue laughing and making ridiculous faces, with the former morphing into a ""HA-HA"" shape. Squidward and Nosferatu look at each other and facepalm.]
Squidward: Knock it off!
Nosferatu: [hisses]
Slappy: I am sorry master. [kisses Nosferatu's hand] It won't happen again. [continues kissing Nosferatu's hand]
Squidward: [disgusted] Ew. We'll let ourselves out.
SpongeBob: [being dragged by Squidward, still with rearranged body parts] Aw, I don't want to leave. Boo!
Squidwward: [lightning crashes] Ah!
Slappy: [closing door with face] Oh, you can't leave due to inclement weather.
SpongeBob: We can't leave yet. Yay!
Squidward: [Nosferatu appears behind him] Gulp.
Slappy: [slithering off Nosferatu] The Master has invited you to stay for the night, but first, he would like to have you both for dinner. [laughs]
SpongeBob: [laughs]
[Squidward slaps SpongeBob, spinning him around. Nosferatu hits Slappy on the head.]
Squidward: Well, uh, under the circumstances, I wouldn't mind some fine Transylvanian cuisine for a change.
SpongeBob: [turning into cash register] Change? I can make change. [laughs]
Squidward: [shoves SpongeBob away] Get away from me. [SpongeBob shoots a coin at his face]
Nosferatu: [gesturing and floating away] Come, come.
Squidward: [following] Oh, oh.
SpongeBob: [bounces whilst leaving change behind, laughing]
[Slappy's head comes out of the armored statue, and falls to the ground as the statue breaks into pieces. He then slithers up to the front entrance of the castle and pulls a string to turn off a storm cloud. He laughs as he pats the storm cloud and falls off. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward seated at a long dinner table in another room. Nosferatu is sitting at the other end, reading a Bat Fancy magazine.]
Squidward: [looking at table] Wow! [puts napkin on neck] What a spread. I don't know what to try first.
Slappy: [pops out of platter] Oh, I can help you decide. [laughs, opening platters] We have roasted werewolf teeth, pickled demon beards, fried mummy fingers, and [head opens to reveal his brain] brains tartare.
Squidward: [gags and throws up off-screen]
SpongeBob: Ooh, don't mind if I do-- [reaches for Slappy's head as it closes] oh. [laughs]
Slappy: Or, maybe you would like something sinfully succulent. [opens platter to reveal a Carpathian cheese ball]
Squidward: Ooh, a Carpathian cheese ball. [tries to dip cookie into the cheese ball, which turns into several spiders]
Slappy: Uh, eh. Whoopsie! That's my dinner. [holds eating utensils, runs after spiders off-screen] Come to daddy!
SpongeBob: Ooh.
Squidward: [breaks cookie, winces]
SpongeBob: [waving mummy finger] Oh, you've got to try these mummy fingers, Squidward. [takes bite out of mummy finger] So delicious. Nosferatu, you simply must give me the recipe.
Squidward: Hm. [looks down at mummy finger, woman screams] Well, maybe if I [holds finger] put some ketchup on it.
SpongeBob: [munching on fingers] Ketchup? [holds finger] Good thing I came prepared. [wearing cowboy outfit, wielding two ketchup bottles] Ketching up! [squirts ketchup onto Squidward's mummy finger, who winces]
Squidward: Hmm. Ah.
SpongeBob: [laughs, then slips and squirts ketchup onto Squidward's face]
Squidward: [sighs]
[Nosferatu leaves the table and approaches Squidward to lick off the ketchup from his face. Squidward feels his face as Nosferatu gags on the ketchup.]
SpongeBob: [holding ketchup] Nosferatu, ketchup? [slipping, squirting ketchup onto Nosferatu] Whoa!
Squidward: [sighs]
Slappy: [laughs as he chases after spiders on the table]
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Squidward rucked into a bed in a bedroom.]
Nosferatu: [hisses]
Slappy: [holding candle] The Master says, ""Sleep tight and don't let the vampire bats bite."" [laughs]
[SpongeBob and Slappy start laughing. They eventually swap faces as they continue laughing.]
Nosferatu: [hisses]
Slappy: The master bids you good night. [laughs softly]
SpongeBob: [waving] Good night, Nosferatu!
[The lights in the room repeatedly flicker as Nosferatu and Slappy get close to SpongeBob and Squidward. They then briefly appear in bed between SpongeBob and Squidward before disappearing, and the door closes.]
Squidward: This place gives me the creeps. But, so what? It's only one night. Right, SpongeB--
SpongeBob: [snoring]
Squidward: [turns lamp off, then SpongeBob gets up] Huh?
SpongeBob: Whoops! Forgot to brush my teeth. [opens door and leaves]
[Nosferatu appears from the painting above Squidward and hisses at him. He disappears and the painting is put back in place as SpongeBob gets back into bed.]
SpongeBob: [snores, but gets back up] Whoops! Forgot to floss. [leaves]
Squidward: Huh? [continues sleeping, Nosferatu appears again behind the painting]
[Nosferatu disappears again as SpongeBob gets back into bed.]
SpongeBob: [snores, but gets back up again] Ooh! [rubbing head] Forgot to wash my head. [leaves]
Squidward: Huh? [goes back to sleep]
[Nosferatu appears again, and disappears again as SpongeBob gets back into bed.]
SpongeBob: [gets up again] Whoops! Forgot to polish my eyes.
Squidward: Huh?
[Nosferatu pops out of the painting again, and pops back in as SpongeBob gets back in bed. Squidward turns on the lamp.]
Squidward: [yelling] Will you go night night time already?
SpongeBob: [noticing Nosferatu] Nosferatu? [lights flicker]
Squidward: Why are you sticking out of the wall like that?
[SpongeBob and Squidward run out of the room, and Nosferatu bites into a pillow, then spits it out.]
Squidward: [running with SpongeBob] I can't believe Nosferatu tried to bite me! He's a real-life v-v-v-v-v-vampire!
SpongeBob: He's gonna suck our blood! [sobs]
Squidward: There's got to be a way out of this castle!
Slappy: [slithering in front of them] I can show you a way out. [laughs while holding battle ax]
[SpongeBob and Squidward wear gas masks as Squidward shoots sleepy gas onto Slappy.]
Slappy: [suddenly tired] Slappy sleepy. [falls to ground]
Squidward: [tosses gas equipment] Let's try these doors. [opens door to reveal scary monsters on the other side]
SpongeBob and Squidward: [scream and run away]
[Squidward opens another door to reveal a skull with flaming eyes. They both scream. Squidward opens another door to reveal some live-action sushi and both scream. They begin running on a conveyor belt and look behind them to see a mutant gorilla running after them.]
SpongeBob and Squidward: Gorilla monster! [scream]
Squidward: Quick, [points] down the laundry chute!
[They both dive into the laundry chute. The gorilla falls on its face and crashes off-screen.]
SpongeBob: [he and Squidward slide down a slide] Whoa! [both end up in a laundry basket wearing vampire outfits, and scream at each other]
Squidward: [pointing to coffin] It's a vampire's coffin! [holds onto SpongeBob and whimpers]
[Five coffins rise from underneath the sand and start dancing around SpongeBob and Squidward. The coffins spin around and vampire fish come out of them.]
Vampire fish: Nosferatu two-step! [close their coffins and enter the sand again]
SpongeBob: [clapping] Yay! [gets slapped by Squidward] Ow.
Squidward: [grabs onto SpongeBob] Snap out of it, SpongeBob! [grabs own neck] What if he bites our necks... [gasps] Or my [grabs nose] nose?
SpongeBob: Oh! I know what to do. [uses own fingers as fangs] In those vampire movies, they always make wooden stakes.
Squidward: [gasps] That's a great idea! Here!
[Squidward gives SpongeBob and himself each a log as they both use knives to cut wood. They make wooden steaks. A cow is heard mooing.]
SpongeBob: Will these even work without steak sauce? [both hold onto each other]
[Slappy's head rolls down the stairs. SpongeBob and Squidward scream.]
Slappy: You shouldn't disturb the master's laundry tomb. He would be very cranky if [his body walks up to him, and he puts himself back together] he found you here, [SpongeBob and Squidward whimper] and you never know where he might be.
Squidward: He's right behind us, isn't he?
SpongeBob: [using mirror] Hmm? Nope. Nobody there. We're fine.
Nosferatu: [in coffin next to them, hisses]
SpongeBob and Squidward: [scream]
Squidward: Please don't eat us!
Slappy: Oh, the master is not hungry. He just had a big lunch. He wanted to return your mail.
Squidward: Oh. Well, how thoughtful of you. Uh, [grabs package] thanks.
SpongeBob: Ooh! Open it, Squidward! What'd you get?
Squidward: [opens package to reveal garlic] Oh, yes! It's my Garlic of the Month Club! [Noseferatu winces] Wait. Uh-oh.
Nosferatu: [pretends to gag, smiles]
Slappy: The master is just joshing with you. He loves garlic. [laughs, then everyone else laughs]
[The lights begin flickering.]
Squidward: Huh?
Nosferatu: [shrugs]
Squidward: Well, if you're not flicking the lights on and off, then who is?
[All four of them huddle around each other as the lights continue flickering. It is revealed that the Phantom of the Opera is flicking the light switch.]
SpongeBob, Squidward, and Slappy: Phantom of the Opera!
Phantom of the Opera: [laughs, then everyone else follows]

He walks through the museum, heading to a portrait of the Krusty Krab, saying it is ""painted in shades of greed."" A zoom-in into the portrait leads into the episode, which starts with Mr. Krabs locking up the Krusty Krab. While leaving the restaurant, he notices a quarter rolling down the street and chases after that. After Mr. Krabs stops for breath, the quarter suddenly stops rolling. Mr. Krabs gets a glass of water and splashes it into his face. He gives a signal for the quarter to continue rolling, leading him into a store. Passing through the store, the quarter bounces off a loose floorboard and lands inside a payphone. Mr. Krabs shakes the payphone to try to get the quarter out, while an old Klopnodian man calls him from behind. Mr. Krabs asks the man for his quarter, to which he says that he can have the payphone. However, the man warns Mr. Krabs of a curse inside the payphone.The next morning at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs installs the payphone and informs the customers that they can use it at the cost of a quarter. Mr. Krabs gets a call from the payphone, to which a voice tells him to give away Krabby Patties for free. Mr. Krabs questions the voice inside, but the phone suddenly attaches to his eyes and hypnotizes him into saying the Krabby Patties are free. SpongeBob takes notice of these words and throws the patties towards the customers. The phone detaches from Mr. Krabs, causing him to get out of his hypnotized state. A quarter comes out of the payphone and Mr. Krabs quickly realizes SpongeBob is giving away free patties. Mr. Krabs takes away all of the patties and forces SpongeBob to get back into the kitchen.Mr. Krabs receives another call from the payphone, to which he is then hypnotized into giving away all of his money. He goes into his office and gives his money to his customers. SpongeBob questions Mr. Krabs' actions at first, but thinks he still has his generous side and grabs the register. The phone detaches from Mr. Krabs' eyes and Mr. Krabs is de-hypnotized again as he gets another quarter. He notices SpongeBob giving money out and grabs the register from him. SpongeBob gets confused from Mr. Krabs' state as another call from the payphone comes in. Mr. Krabs is then hypnotized into giving away the Krusty Krab.Plankton is seen outside of the restaurant, preparing a laser cannon. Mr. Krabs, in his hypnotized state, gives the Krusty Krab deed to Plankton. Plankton questions the action at first, but still celebrates his win. Meanwhile, a bolt falls out of the laser cannon, causing the machine to hit Plankton. Mr. Krabs is de-hypnotized again, but a quarter does not come out of the phone this time. The voice inside the phone laughs as Mr. Krabs uses a crowbar to unlock the coin slot.Mr. Krabs notices a demon inside the phone, revealed to have been using a commutator to hypnotize Mr. Krabs. The two glare at each other until it turns out that the demon and Mr. Krabs have switched places. The demon locks the coin slot and asks SpongeBob for a quarter for a bus ride. Mr. Krabs, now managing the payphone, enjoys being inside due to the money near him. However, he soon notices shaking, which is revealed to be coming from Squidward smashing the payphone with a mallet, while Plankton now owns the Krusty Krab. Plankton tells Squidward to get rid of the payphone. Squidward throws the payphone into the dumpster, with Mr. Krabs still inside.The scene cuts to the French Narrator in the center of a wormhole, with him saying ""a free phone sometimes comes at a very high price"" and ""cheapskates sometimes get stuck with the bill."" A payphone flies over to the French Narrator. As he answers it, the phone takes over and hypnotizes him, causing him to tell another story. His introduction sets up the events of ""A Skin Wrinkle in Time.""",You're Going to Pay...Phone,"[The episode opens with the French Narrator walking to the screen. He is in a museum.]
French Narrator: Bonjour, art lovers. [he starts to walk around the museum] Tonight, for your viewing enjoyment, we present a portrait. [he stands next to a portrait of the Krusty Krab] Painted in shades of greed.
[The camera zooms in on the portrait, and Mr. Krabs is seen walking out of the Krusty Krab during closing.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, another day, another whole bunch of dollars! [He locks up the restaurant and walks away laughing. He stops when he notices a quarter rolling on the floor] Ooh, a quarter! [he starts to chase the quarter] Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme! Whew, come back here, you! [the quarter makes a right turn, as Mr. Krabs follows] Hey, hey, where are you going? [He keeps running while panting, until he stops to catch his breath. The quarter stops too when it notices Mr. Krabs is no longer chasing it. Krabs gets a glass of water and splashes the water onto his face. He signals a thumbs up. The quarter continues to roll]
[Their chase takes them to an unknown store. The quarter hops up its stairs, and into the entrance.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [he walks in and continues to chase the quarter, passing by the several items in this store] Boy, this quarter is really making me work.
[The quarter rolls onto a loose floorboard which flings it up in the air, and into a payphone.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? Hey, get back here! [he tries to get the quarter out by shaking the payphone, which doesn't work]
[Suddenly, an old man walks in from behind.]
Old Klopnodian man: Greetings, stranger.
[The man's sudden appearance freaks out Mr. Krabs, making him scream.]
Old Klopnodian man: Welcome to my emporium of wonders. Can I interest you in a traditional Klopnodian Spladunker? [he pulls out an anvil covered in pink fur as a chicken is heard clucking] Or perhaps a lightly used Flooda? [he pulls out a sweater made out of sausages as a cow is heard mooing]
Mr. Krabs: No thanks, old timer. I just want me quarter. It seems to have hopped into your payphone here.
Old Klopnodian man: Oh, I see. Well, I have no power to retrieve your coin, but I can let you have the payphone. For the low, low price of... free.
Mr. Krabs: Free!? I'll take it!
Old Klopnodian man: But be warned, that payphone comes with a curse! [thunder roars and a woman screams]
Mr. Krabs: Really? How much does the curse cost?
Old Klopnodian man: What? No, the curse is free. It comes with the phone.
Mr. Krabs: Well, then, I'll take the curse too! [he picks up the payphone and leaves as he laughs]
Old Klopnodian man: Heed my Kapritzka! Beware the call of the porch! Beware it! Ah, forget it.
[Cut to a time card that reads ""The Next Morning.""]
French Narrator: The next morning...
[The scene cuts to the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs is installing the payphone. He runs up to different customers as he speaks..]
Mr. Krabs: Listen up, happy Krustomers! For the low price of a quarter, now you too can make that important call, while you're eating a Krabby Patty! [the phone rings and Mr. Krabs walks over to answer it] Ahoy there, Krusty Krab. Eugene Krabs, proprietor, speaking.
Demon: [evil laughter] Give away your Krabby Patties. Give them all away!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] What kind of obscene phone call is this? When I find out who you are, I'm gonna- [the phone suddenly attaches itself to Krabs' eye, and it begins to hypnotize him] Must. Give. Patties. Away. [The scene cuts to the register, where a customer is about to pay for his meal, until Krabs slaps his arm.] No money. Patties. Free!
[SpongeBob sticks his head out the kitchen window.]
SpongeBob: Free patties? Oh, Mr. Krabs. You finally found your inner generosity. Hooray! [He goes back into the kitchen and comes out the door with a plate of Krabby Patties, throwing them to the customers] Krabby Patties for everyone! The crab is picking up the tab!
[Customers get excited and cheer as they receive their free patties.]
Mr. Krabs: All. Free.
[Customers continue to cheer, then they begin to eat their patties.]
Demon: [laughs as the phone is separated from Krabs' eye, and it hangs up]
Mr. Krabs: [comes to his senses and shakes his head] Uh.. What just happened? [a quarter rolls out of the payphone as Krabs takes it] Oh boy, a quarter! I knew this thing would pay off.
SpongeBob: [wearing a huge Krabby Patty hat with a glowing green ""FREE"" sign] Patties here! Free patties! Get your patties while they're hot and while they're free!
Mr. Krabs: Free?! [takes half-eaten Krabby Patties from customers and puts them in a bag] SpongeBob, there's no free lunches at the Krusty Krab! Have you gone insane? Get back in the kitchen and stitch these patty halves back together, so we can sell them again! [turns SpongeBob's sign off]
SpongeBob: [sighs] It was too good to last... [returns to the kitchen]
[The payphone calls again as Mr. Krabs picks it up.]
Mr. Krabs: Krusty Krab, Eugene... [the phone hypnotizes him again]
Demon: [laughs] Now, give away your money! Every last cent.
Mr. Krabs: Must. Give away. Money. [goes into his office and gets his money, which he starts throwing from the mast. SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen to see what's going on] Give away. All money. Boy-o.
SpongeBob: But... You just said that... Oh, I knew you were only kidding, Mr. Krabs! You really are generous! [grabs the cash register and runs to the customers]
Mr. Krabs: [gets unhypnotized again as the second quarter rolls out of the payphone] He-he, another quarter! I love this phone!
[he then notices SpongeBob throwing money out of the cash register and takes it from him]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! What are you doing with me money?
SpongeBob: Well I thought you told me to, Mr. Krabs, I... Oh, I don't understand...
Demon: [as he attaches the phone to Mr. Krabs one last time] And now, Krabs... Give away The Krusty Krab! [laughs maliciously]
[Plankton stands near the restaurant, calibrating his laser cannon]
Plankton: Yes! With this laser cannon, I can finally blast Krabs! [Mr. Krabs gets his attention, holding the deed to the restaurant] Hummina-wha?...
Mr. Krabs: [gives him the deed] Here is deed. To Krusty Krab. She's all yours. [walks off]
Plankton: Something doesn't seem right here. But, like Granny Plankton always says: ""Never look a gift snail under the shell!"" I win! [starts dancing] I'm the greatest! [Plankton's dancing causes the bolt he just screwed to come off as the cannon points itself at him] Huh? Uh-oh... [it blasts him]
[Mr. Krabs returns to the restaurant and comes to his senses again, expecting the third quarter, but the phone doesn't give him any]
Mr. Krabs: Oh... What the? Where's me quarter? [grabs a crowbar and tries to unlock the coin slot as the demon laughs]
Demon: Perhaps generosity is its own reward?
Mr. Krabs: Never!
[Mr. Krabs unlocks the payphone's coin slot and notices the demon sitting inside of it, managing it through the commutator. The two exchange angry glares at each other until the demon switches them both places]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, what's the big idea? And where's that quarter you owe... [the demon closes the coin slot]
Demon: I'm free! [laughs and checks his pockets, finding out he doesn't have any change on him, and turns to SpongeBob] Uh... Hey, kid, lend me a quarter for the bus?
SpongeBob: [gives him a quarter] Sure thing, Mr. Demon!
Demon: I'm finally free! [runs off, laughing]
[The Krusty Krab is now being managed by Plankton, while Mr. Krabs manages the payphone.]
Mr. Krabs: Now this ain't so bad. Steady work, and plenty of quarters! [laughs] A crab could get used to this. [the payphone shakes] Hey! What's going on?
[SpongeBob walks out, carrying some patties. Squidward is outside, smashing the payphone with a mallet.]
Plankton: Hey, Squidward, get that hunk of junk outta here, would ya? Come on.
Squidward: Gladly. [throws it in the trash]
Mr. Krabs: [through the phone] Hello? Anyone wanna make a call? Only costs a quarter! Oh, barnacles...
[The scene fades to the French Narrator in the middle of a wormhole.]
French Narrator: Sometimes, a free phone comes at a very high price. And sometimes, the cheapskates are ones who get stuck with the bill, here in the Tidal Zone. [a payphone flies over to him as he picks it up] Allo. [it takes over as the French Narrator screams and drops over, but gets back up with his visor swirling as if he's hypnotized] Must give away one more story...  A story of a grandpa adrift in space and time. A story of a sea star who is lost... In The Tidal Zone. [leaves, starting the next episode]",0.31,Andrew Goodman

In the meantime, Mr. Krabs has transferred Squidward to the circus, and SpongeBob to the The Salty Spitoon. SpongeBob is frightened by the place and its tough, scary regulars, and is hesitant to go in. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob that he just has to look tough, and confront the strongest patron. After going inside, SpongeBob bumps into a large shark. He gets the shark's attention and compliments his blue eyes, which indirectly starts a brawl between another whale patron with green eyes. SpongeBob is pulled out of the battle by an anglerfish, who is the boss of the place, and she takes him to the kitchen.The grill repeatedly shoots flames, and SpongeBob's ""spatula"" is a rusty trowel. He questions what happened to the last fry cook, and is shown an Employee of the Month wall, all of whom have been killed. The boss demands that he cook a ""brick covered in nails, with extra motor oil."" Misinterpreting it as diner slang, SpongeBob serves up a sandwich. The boss rejects it, and SpongeBob cooks the correct dish. The first customer who eats it likes it, and SpongeBob eagerly prepares more.Suddenly, Mrs. Puff (as ""Puff the Tuff"") shows up, wearing a wig and spiked jacket. When she sees SpongeBob serving at the grill, she runs out screaming. The shark gets suspicious and asks why Mrs. Puff is afraid of him. Mo and the boss test SpongeBob with some ""Trials of Toughness.""The first test is riding a mechanical bull. SpongeBob, thinking that the bull needs a break from people riding it, goes under it and accidentally launches it out of the building. Next, they use a cinder block as a punching bag. SpongeBob misses his aim and knocks over another customer's plate, sending his fork flying and landing in the head of another patron, who compliments his punch. In a ""body hair strength"" competition, SpongeBob uses his abrasive side and carves a piece of wood into a sculpture of his opponent. SpongeBob is declared the toughest guy in the Spitoon, and is given full power to do whatever he wants to the place.After a day, the Salty Spitoon is renovated into the ""Softy Spitoon."" The interior is cute, girly and pink, and all the customers enjoy tea parties, arts, and crafts. A tough new group of bikers show up, surprised at the place being called the toughest in town, and demand to speak to the owner. SpongeBob approaches him, and rather sings a song with the customers about how wholesome the place is. The head biker calls them ""weenies,"" only to be offered food by the shark patron. He rejects the food and makes him cry. The whale defends the shark and threatens the biker, leading to another brawl.Mr. Krabs arrives, only to walk in on the large-scale fight. The anglerfish boss compliments SpongeBob, who is able to do his job and serve the customers while everyone is fighting. The boss wants to keep him, but Krabs demands to have him back. They get into a fight, and SpongeBob saves Mr. Krabs, saying that the place might be too dangerous for him. He gives Krabs a piggyback ride out of the restaurant, as the Softy Spitoon customers chase after him. A pan back to the restaurant's kitchen shows the Employee of the Month wall, with a photo of a smiling SpongeBob captioned ""Employee of da Year"" that is surrounded by childlike drawings.",Salty Sponge,"[The episode starts with SpongeBob exiting his house, ready to go to the Krusty Krab for work. He kisses Gary goodbye and goes to see the mailfish in front of his house, as they exchange happy looks at each other. Bubble transition to SpongeBob seeing a duck with three ducklings walking by. He stops to let them go forward, as the duck blushes, making SpongeBob wink at her. Bubble transition to SpongeBob throwing flowers around.]
SpongeBob: [singing] Soon I will get a thrill, cooking patties on my grill! [jumps to the Krusty Krab door, but is blocked by a huge sign in front it, which he reads out loud] ""The Krusty Krab is closed on account of urchins""? Oh, I must be in a nightmare!
Mr. Krabs: [walks towards him, covered in urchins] It's no nightmare, SpongeBob. I'm closing the old girl up for a week to get rid of those prickly pests. [flicks urchin away, SpongeBob whimpers] Plus, I had a coupon for ""Urchin-Be-Gone""!
SpongeBob: What will become of me? What am I gonna do for a [screams] whole week?!
Mr. Krabs: [squishes him down] Slow your roll, boy-o. I've rented you out to a different establishment for the week, [raises claw] so as not to disrupt me [pokes SpongeBob] incoming moneys.
SpongeBob: Oh boy! A temporary job sounds so adventurous! Is Squidward coming too?
Mr. Krabs: Nope. I got him a job in the entertainment industry.
SpongeBob: Whoa...
[Cut to Squidward working as a circus clown.]
Squidward: Still better than working with SpongeBob... [a sea elephant sits on him]
SpongeBob: Where will I be working, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: You'll be working right here, [zooms out to show the Salty Spitoon] at the Salty Spitoon! [spits, a starfish is launched out of the building and screams]
SpongeBob: [worried] No thanks! That place is too tough for me!
[A hammerhead shark walks by, growls at SpongeBob, and barks, scaring him.]
Mr. Krabs: You don't have to be tough to work here, you just gotta look tough! [he molds SpongeBob's face to make him look ""tough""] There! Now you look like a tough guy.
SpongeBob: I don't feel tough, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Now when you go in there, go up to the biggest customer, [looks at SpongeBob with one eye open] , look him squarely in the eye, [fight bell dings] and let him know exactly what you think of him.
SpongeBob: [face reverts to normal] No problem, Mr. K. I'm great at looking [all his facial features become square] squarely. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: [quickly squishes his face back to looking tough] No funny business, boy-o! [pushes him inside]
[Pan of the Salty Spitoon, where everyone is seen fighting. SpongeBob nervously steps by, avoids some ice cubes, and bumps into a shark patron.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [makes his face tough and pokes him]
Shark patron: [growls]
SpongeBob: [tough] Grr, I'm gonna tell you exactly what I think of you! [kindly] You have got the most beautiful baby blue eyes.
Shark patron: Aw, thanks. I got 'em from me mother.
Whale patron: [butts heads with the shark patron] Blue eyes? Everybody knows my green eyes are the most beautiful.
Shark patron: [pushes back] Oh, yeah?
Whale patron: [pushes back] Yeah!
[They get into a fight. SpongeBob is swept up in the resulting dust cloud. An anglerfish grabs him out of it and takes his Krusty Krab employee hat off.]
Sally: You must be SpongeBob. Welcome to the Salty Spitoon! [spits] I'm the owner of this joint! That means you's work for me now! [throws hat away]
SpongeBob: My new boss! So nice to meet-- [Sally slams him on the ground and drags him away.]
[Sally takes SpongeBob into the kitchen and puts a stained apron on him.]
Sally: Here's the grill! [shows him a grill that shoots flames] Here's the spa-toola! [gives him a rusty trowel] Now make with the grub!
SpongeBob: [face shrinks] Um, just out of curiosity, what happened to your last fry cook?
Sally: That's our ""Employee of the Month"" wall! [points to a board with multiple pictures of gravestones]
SpongeBob: [gulps, woman screams]
Sally: Your photo's [zoom in on photo] gonna be next if you don't get to woik! [slams door, grill flames shoot]
SpongeBob: [nervously] Don't worry SpongeBob, it'll be just like working at the Krusty Krab. [In a thought bubble, SpongeBob wears an enlarged employee hat and repeatedly flips finished patties off the grill]
Dream SpongeBob: La la la la la!
Dream Squidward: Keep those patties coming, pal! I love you!
Sally: [breaks his thought bubble] Gimme a brick covered with nails with extra motor oil! [SpongeBob ends up making a bagel] Huh? What is this garbage? [throws it away] I asked for a [hits palm twice] brick covered with nails.
SpongeBob: Oh. I thought that was just diner lingo. Sorry! [makes the dish] Covered with nails, extra motor oil, Salty Spitoon style! [spits]
Sally: Hmm. Now that's a tough sandwich.
[She serves it to an octopus customer, who devours it quickly.]
Octopus customer: Ooh, the brick is so tender, and the nails are roasted!
[SpongeBob is in the kitchen, crossing his fingers. He smiles when the customers cheer. Sally throws a bunch of order papers on him.]
Sally: Got some more orders for you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [shakes them off] 72 bricks covered in motor oil coming right up! [cooks them and launches them at the customers, when someone comes to the door]
Mrs. Puff: [wearing a punk outfit] Whaddaya know? Whaddaya say, gang?
Customer: It's Puff the Tuff!
Doorman: P-P-P-P-Puff the Tuff!?
[Mrs. Puff headbutts him and walks through the smoke cloud. She puffs up to get rid of the customers at the counter, and sits on a stool. Sally watches from behind the counter.]
Mrs. Puff: Gimme a tall glass of broken glass in a dirty glass.
[Sally serves it. Mrs. Puff bites the glass and chews it. SpongeBob is heard laughing.]
Mrs. Puff: That laugh. No! It can't be him.
SpongeBob: [holds up bomb with barbecue sauce] Who ordered the bomb-becue? [laughs]
Mrs. Puff: [screams] SpongeBob! [runs away screaming, and squeezes through the door, as everyone watches]
Customers: [gasping]
SpongeBob: [confused] Was that Mrs. Puff?
Shark patron: Wait a second. Why is Puff the Tuff afraid of you?
SpongeBob: Oh, she probably didn't recognize me now that I'm a [makes cute face] tough guy. [looks down] Oh, my shoelace is untied. Safety first.
[He leans down and tilts the bomb-becue into the whale shark's face, exploding it and making him scream.]
Mo: That new little cook seems pretty tough. [bites into brick]
Sally: Oh, yeah? [close-up on her face] Let's see how tough he is. [close-up of her mouth] Let the trials of toughness begin! [zoom out to show an octopus sailor riding a mechanical bull] Mechanical Sea-bull!
[The mechanical bull bucks the octopus off and through the ceiling.]
SpongeBob: Aw, poor thing. You're probably tired of people riding you all the time. Take a break and ride me.
[SpongeBob climbs under the bull and rides around with it. He launches it out of the ceiling.]
SpongeBob: Oops!
[The starfish, octopus, and now the bull are outside the Salty Spitoon. The bull pumps its fist.]
Sally: Punching bag!
[A giant trevally punches bricks of concrete. SpongeBob is wearing boxing gloves and winds up, but accidentally knocks a fish's plate of food away. The fork flies into the ceiling and bounces into the trevally's head, deflating it.]
Trevally: [high-pitched voice, gives thumbs up] Nice punch, SpongeBob!
Sally: [off-screen] Body hair strength!
[An orange sailor pumps up his chest, then shreds a log of wood with his chest hair. He flicks the remaining toothpick away. Sally looks at SpongeBob, next to a giant block of wood.]
SpongeBob: Uh. Oh! I'll just use my abrasive side! [shows abrasive side on his back, laughs]
[SpongeBob carves the wood into a sculpture of his opponent.]
Orange sailor: [gasps] Aww. [tears up, sniffs, and holds it]
Sally: [holds SpongeBob by one arm] I declare the toughest guy at The Salty Spitoon... [spits] is SpongeBob SquarePants. [everyone cheers and applause]
[A giant eel's medal falls off her tail and crushes SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Whoo!
Shark patron: As our tough guy leader, [unrolls ""Charter of Tough"", dated 1848] you have the power to do whatever you want.
SpongeBob: Well, in that case, I've got a few [morphs his face] wild ideas for this place.
French Narrator: [narrating time card] One day later...

A bug hits the barracuda's teeth, and a windshield wiper pushes it off. Shot of the barracuda riding his motorycle. Reg is reading a newspaper, notices him, and screams. When he throws his paper away, he is seen in a pink outfit. The motoryclists circle around the Salty Spitoon. The leader stops and steps out.]
Barracuda: All right, guys. Prepare to rumble in the toughest place in Bikini Bottom! [spits]
Motocyclists: [cheering]
Barracuda: [enters] Huh? [growls]
[Shots are shown of two sailors having a tea party, tough fish painting one holding a lollipop, and Mo reading books with two twin-looking fish. The barracuda looks outside and repeatedly compares the Salty Spitoon's sign to Weenie Hut Jr's.]
Barracuda: Yeah, no, no, no, no. This is the right place. [screams] What's going on in here? I demand to speak to whoever's in charge. [grits teeth accompanied by gun reloading sound]
[The patrons talk quietly. SpongeBob marches up like an old west gunslinger. He steps on a stool and raises his chef hat.]
SpongeBob: Welcome, stranger.
Barracuda: Oh. [chuckles] Why is the cheese talking to me?
SpongeBob: You asked to speak with the tough leader?
Barracuda: No, no, really, who let this guy in here?
SpongeBob: I see you're admiring the new décor.
Sailor: [in cutesy outfit, raising teacup] Tell him how it is, lad!
SpongeBob: I'll do him one better. [singing] ♪ Ohhh...
[The customers all turn and face him, joining SpongeBob's note.]

Barracuda: [raises the screen] Enough! You're acting like a bunch of weenies.
Whale shark: Weenies? We have those, and they are to die for. [gives the barracuda a weenie on a toothpick] A dab of freshly pickled relish, perhaps? [puts relish on it]
[The barracuda slaps the toothpick and bowl away, making the whale shark cry.]
Barracuda: [pokes him] Hey! There ain't no cryin' in The Softy-- I mean The Salty Spitoon.
Whale patron: Well, there is now, buttercup. And if you don't like it, you can hike it!
Barracuda: [presses against him] Oh, yeah?
Whale patron: [rolls up sleeves] Yeah!
[The patrons all get into a fight. Mr. Krabs walks to the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, let's see how SpongeBob is doing. This oughta be good. [enters and sees everyone fighting]
Sally: Krabs, what are you doin' here? The week ain't up yet.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob isn't giving you a problem?
Sally: Problem? Nah, he's the belle of the ball.
[As two customers are fighting, SpongeBob rides in on his unicycle and feeds one a cupcake, then gives him a balloon.]
Sally: In fact, the customers like him so much, I'm gonna keep him on permanently.
Mr. Krabs: You can't do that! He's coming back with me right now!
Sally: [rolls up sleeves] Oh, yeah?
Mr. Krabs: [snaps claws] Yeah!

When Patrick unveils it, he realizes that it is not the one he ordered. The rock ends up crushing the mailman, with Patrick telling him that he cannot deliver mail in his current condition, so he throws the mailman into his rock while he decides to deliver the mail in his place. Patrick goes to SpongeBob's house and tells SpongeBob about his new duty. He soon allows SpongeBob to help him deliver mail around Bikini Bottom.SpongeBob and Patrick first stop by Squidward's house, and SpongeBob rings the doorbell. Patrick gives Squidward his package, which Squidward opens to reveal a turbo clarinet. He uses it to blow SpongeBob and Patrick away into downtown Bikini Bottom. They land in front of a pickle-based building and try to get the mail through the mail slot, but the envelope repeatedly comes back to them. SpongeBob rings the doorbell and Kevin answers, only to turn down their delivery. SpongeBob suggests that he and Patrick should move on, but Patrick vows to make their delivery successful.SpongeBob and Patrick leave the package in front of the building. Patrick comes out of the package, but Kevin launches him away. SpongeBob and Patrick try to go through the roof, with Patrick disguised as Santa. He falls down the chimney and lands in the fireplace. Kevin refuses to take the envelope and tries to run from Patrick, but he pulls Kevin back inside. The two then fight with jellyfish nets and Patrick ends up catching Kevin and giving him the envelope. He sees that the envelope was meant for Bubble Bass and slams his front door, revealing Bubble Bass behind it as he treads away.SpongeBob and Patrick go to Old Man Walker's house and attempt to deliver his mail, but they cannot find anything for him. They feel sad for him, so they give him another envelope. Old Man Walker opens it to see a foreclosure letter, thinking he has been drafted. SpongeBob and Patrick give him more mail, making him explode in joy. While walking through Bikini Bottom, they see that they are out of mail. They see a mail truck and hijack it to deliver more mail. A mailwoman sees her truck stolen, and calls for more mailmen to chase after SpongeBob and Patrick.SpongeBob and Patrick continue giving mail away while being chased down. The mailmen jump onto the hijacked truck, and SpongeBob and Patrick throw packages at them, launching them away. They drop more mail to cause the other mail trucks to slip away from them, and launch mail towards a helicopter to drive it away from them. Furious, Kevin throws away another jury summons letter for Bubble Bass, who runs away after the helicopter uncovers his barrel hideout. SpongeBob and Patrick drive into a post office, and end up being delivered to a jail warden, as the episode ends.",Patrick the Mailman,"[The episode begins with the mailman walking down the street whistling, delivering mail to Patrick's house. The mailman puts his left hand in his mailbag and takes out a huge package that resembles a rock. He is struggling to hold the giant package and sweats as he's doing so.]
Mailman: Special delivery!
[Patrick opens up his rock house and is seen attached to the bottom of it.]
Patrick: Ooh! My new rock is finally here!
[Patrick slides down from his rock and runs over to open it. Patrick rips off the wrapping paper whole and the package is revealed to be a pink rock with green polka dots on it with a bronze arrow-shaped weather vane on top.]
Patrick: [putting his hands on his hips while looking suspicious] Hold on.
[Patrick jumps up onto the rock and puts his glasses on]
Patrick: Polka dots?! I ordered plaid!
[Patrick takes his glasses off and throws them away.]
Patrick: You'll have to take it back, Mr. Mailman.
Mailman: [still struggling to hold up the rock] Back?
[The rock crushes the mailman and letters come flying out. Patrick lifts up the rock and the mailman is flattened into the ground with black eyes.]
Patrick: Mr. Mailman?
Mailman: My back!
[Patrick picks up the mailman and puts his hat to his mouth and blows into it like a balloon. The mailman is back to normal and Patrick puts him back down feet first on the ground.]
[The mailman is groaning in pain.]
Patrick: [while adjusting the mailman's hat] You okay, buddy?
Mailman: Gotta... deliver... mail.
Patrick: You are in no shape to deliver anything, fella. Just relax and [throws the mailman to Patrick's rock] crash at my place. I'll deliver your mail for you today. [his rock closes. Patrick walks off just to run back] Oops! [opens his rock] Almost forgot my mailbag. [grabs it from the mailman and walks off, as his rock automatically closes again. He runs back and opens the rock again] Oops! [grabs a hat from the mailman] Almost forgot my mailman hat! [his rock automatically closes yet again. Patrick hums] All righty. [searches for mail in the bag] Let's see where my first [takes out an envelope] delivery is! [struggles to read the envelope and shoves it onto his eyes] D'oh, I can't read this! [the camera pans to SpongeBob's house. Patrick bangs his head on the door four times and becomes dizzy]
SpongeBob: [opens his door] Hey, Patrick. I thought that sounded like your head.
Patrick: SpongeBob! Do you know where this [struggling to read SpongeBob's name on the envelope] Spon-gee-Boob Squir-pa-Nants lives?
SpongeBob: Never heard of him.
Patrick: [crumbles the envelope] Oh, well. [throws the crumbled envelope] Return to sender.
SpongeBob: Hey, what's with the new [flicks Patrick's hat] threads?
Patrick: I'm... [he is shown to be more muscular] a mailman now! [giggles]
SpongeBob: Wow! I've always wanted to be a mailman. It's like getting to be [Jingle bell sounds are heard.] Santa every day! Except Sundays.
Patrick: Sorry, SpongeBob, but I'm the mailman now.
SpongeBob: [disappointed] Oh, okay.
Patrick: [holding a small package with a tied string.] But you can be my [pulls the string to reveal another mailman hat] postal pal!
SpongeBob: [confetti comes out of his ears] Whee! [grabs the hat and puts it on] Oh, ah!
Patrick: [his face is shown in front of a real starfish] Let's [the camera zooms out to him and SpongeBob, who is wearing sunglasses] get mailing. [puts on sunglasses]
[They walk to Squidward's house.]
Patrick: Postal pal, you may ring the doorbell. [gestures to Squidward's doorbell]
SpongeBob: [gasps excitedly and runs to the doorbell] Yes sir, Mr. Mailman, sir! Ooh, I better warm up the ol' bell ringer. [moves his finger up and down twice] Up, down, up, down. [twists his finger right] Twist right, [twists his finger left] twist left. And... [puts nail polish on his finger] polish the nail.
[SpongeBob inhales and blows to his finger. He finally rings the doorbell, and Squidward opens the door.]
Patrick: [shouting] Mail! [SpongeBob crouches and Patrick offers a package to Squidward above SpongeBob's head.]
Squidward: They let a moron like you deliver the mail?
Patrick: Oh, you'd be surprised what they let morons do.
Squidward: [gasps, then takes the package] It's here! It's here! [laughs as he opens the package]
Patrick: What's wrong with Squidward's face?
[Squidward's face is shown as creepily happy. Hyena laughing sounds are heard.]
SpongeBob: [while Squidward is still opening the package] I think he's... smiling.
Squidward: I finally got it! [holds it up] My turbo clarinet! [pulls the motor's recoil start twice and blows into it]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa! [they are sent flying away until they hit a flower cloud and fall down]
Squidward: Worth every penny.
[SpongeBob and Patrick crash onto the road to Kevin's house.]
Patrick: Oh, good, our next stop.
SpongeBob: [looking for an envelope until he pulls one out] A summons for jury duty! Lucky. [hands the envelope to Patrick]
Patrick: Special delivery! [delivers the envelope into the door mail slot]
SpongeBob: Great job, Mr. Mailman. [the envelope retracts to Patrick's butt] Oops. [runs to the door and grabs the envelope off of Patrick's butt and delivers the envelope to the mail slot, but it retracts into one of his pores. He holds out his tongue, revealing the envelope on it] Must be a defective mail slot. [uses his tongue as a hand to deliver the envelope into the mail slot] That oughta do it. [the envelope retracts and slices SpongeBob and stops on Patrick's belly. SpongeBob's body slides off and he puts it back on him] Maybe I'll just try the doorbell. [he swirls his finger and rings the doorbell]
Kevin: [opens the door, unamused] Can I help you?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Special delivery!
Kevin: I don't want it! [slams the door]
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick look at each other] Maybe we should just move on to the next house.
Patrick: Pfft, no. I am a mailman. Like the postal oath says, neither bunions or onions, nor ditches or dangers, will stop me from giving stuff to strangers! [SpongeBob applauds]
[Bubble transition to the next scene with SpongeBob delivering a package to Kevin's front porch. SpongeBob rings the doorbell from a distance. Kevin opens the door.]
Kevin: [notices the package] Ah!
Patrick: [comes out of the package with an envelope] Special delivery! [Kevin growls in anger]
Kevin: Special un -delivery! [presses a button on a remote, triggering the springboard, which launches Patrick away]
Patrick: [comes out of the box injured] Being a mailman isn't like being Santa Claus at all.
[SpongeBob gets an idea with a red Christmas lightbulb over his head. Snowflake transition to SpongeBob as a reindeer climbing towards the roof with his sleigh carrying Patrick as Santa Claus.]
Patrick: Ho ho ho! [leaps on SpongeBob and down the chimney]
[The scene cuts to Kevin drinking juice and reading as the camera pans to Patrick falling to the fireplace and soot covers the screen until it clears. Kevin now has a soot beard.]
Patrick: Hey, we're beard bros. [Kevin growls and shakes the soot beard off of him] Oh, uh, [pulls out the envelope] merry Fishmas!
Kevin: It's July !
Patrick: [hands him the envelope] Just take the letter!
Kevin: I don't [smacks it away] want it! [starts to run]
Patrick: Neither bunions or onions! [chases Kevin as his Santa costume comes off]
[Kevin runs and slides under his table and Patrick slides in mid-air and notices pie on the table. He stops and eats a slice.]
Patrick: [while him and the envelope are still in mid-air] Ah. [grabs the envelope and screams. Kevin is seen trying to escape through his window] Take [grabs Kevin and slams him into the ground] your mail! [elbow smashes Kevin which causes them to get into a dust brawl cloud fight as they enter another room] I'll zip your code so hard!
Kevin: [escapes the dust cloud brawl fight and grabs a jellyfishing net] En garde!
Patrick: [grabs a jellyfish net as well] En lard!
[They both charge at each other while screaming and starting sword-fighting each other with the nets.]
Patrick: I'm gonna stamp you! I'll send you butt express! [hits Kevin with his butt as he files into a knight outfit]
[Patrick tries to hit Kevin with the net, but he jumps and hits Patrick's head. Kevin jumps out of the costume and charges up his run on Patrick and takes off. Patrick's head sticks back up and notices Kevin running away.]
Patrick: You can't run from your civic duties! [chases after Kevin, bounces on a jellyfish plush, and hangs on a chandelier. It breaks and he lands on Kevin]
[As dust clears, Patrick is seen holding the jellyfishing net, which has Kevin in it.]
Patrick: Oh! [puts the envelope on Kevin's mouth] Get it! Slap back, no take backs!
[Kevin slides down to the ground. SpongeBob and Patrick are then seen walking out of Kevin's house.]
Patrick: Not bad.
Kevin: [walks out his door and spits out the envelope and reads the address] This summons is for Bubble Bass, you nincompoops! [rips up the envelope and slams the door in frustration. Bubble Bass is seen hiding beside the door and scatters away. Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick going to the next house. Patrick rings the doorbell but it falls apart]
Old Man Walker: [inside the house] Coming.
[Panicking, Patrick tries to fix the doorbell, then passes it to SpongeBob.]
Old Man Walker: Don't leave.
[SpongeBob puts the broken parts of the doorbell in Patrick's mouth.]
Old Man Walker: Almost there.
[SpongeBob takes out a roll of tape then takes the broken parts out and tape them to the house, then Old Man Walker opens the door.]
Old Man Walker: Oh boy! I never get visitors!
SpongeBob: [as Patrick is searching through the bag for mail] Special delivery, for one special old man.
Patrick: I can't find any mail for him.
Old Man Walker: [sadly] Oh, I never get any mail.
SpongeBob: [in tears] That's so sad. let's give him some of the other mail, huh? [takes out an envelope and writes ""OLD MAN WALKER"" on it with a marker] I found a letter for you, Old Man Walker.
[As Old Man Walker reads the letter, his eyes tear up, and they count down from three. They shoot out tears and go back to normal. He rips up the envelope.]
Old Man Walker: I've been drafted! Oh, boy! [the letter is shown to read ""FORECLOSED""]
SpongeBob: Wow, if one letter made him this happy, I bet all of the mail will make him explode with joy. [they give Old Man Walker all of the mail]
Old Man Walker: Wow, all of this for me? [his head explodes and confetti comes out of it]
[SpongeBob and Patrick dance and laugh around the confetti. Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick walking downtown. Patrick is chewing on some mail.]
SpongeBob: What's next, Postman Patrick?
Patrick: [swallows the mail and shakes the mail bag to see it is empty] Aw, we're all out of mail.
[A mail truck drives by and stops.]
Patrick: [pointing] Let's ask that ice cream truck if it knows where to find some mail.
SpongeBob: That's no ice cream truck. It's a mail truck.
Patrick: Really? I thought all trucks were girls.
[SpongeBob and Patrick goofily salute the mail woman as she opens the back of the truck. She glares at them and walks away. SpongeBob and Patrick giggle and jump into the back of the truck and drive away.]
SpongeBob: [popping out of a mail bag] Wow, we hit the postal jackpot!
Patrick: [driving, looking behind him] Cool.
[The mail truck drives by, and the mail woman notices.]
Mail woman: Huh? Hey! [pointing] Those weirdos stole my truck! [kicks the envelope button on the mailbox, summoning an alarm]
[Several mail trucks appear, along with a mail helicopter. The mail woman is given a rope ladder and climbs onto it.]
Mail woman: Follow those postal pilferers!
Patrick: [driving by, leaving behind lots of mail] A special delivery!
SpongeBob: Special delivery for Fred! [throws an envelope in Fred's direction, who is about to kiss a woman when it lands in between them]
Woman: Huh? [reads the envelope and growls] Who's Carol?
[Fred chuckles as Carol is seen with the couple's drinks on a plate. Cut back to SpongeBob, who is holding a package.]
SpongeBob: This one's for you, Penny! [throws the package at Penny]
[Penny, a rollerskating child, gets hit with the package and falls off the bridge screaming. The package rips apart to reveal an orange raft.]
Penny: Huh? [lands on a current] Oh, great. The raft I ordered has finally arrived. [she screams again once she realizes she is going down a waterfall]
[SpongeBob and Patrick are still in the mail truck, and several mail trucks catch up to them. The mail helicopter flies above the mail truck as two mail people land on top of the mail truck.]
Patrick: Huh? [screams] Pirates!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [see the mail people] Wha-? [the mail people growl at them]
Patrick: Why are these pirates dressed like mail people?
SpongeBob: They want to [points] steal our mail!
Patrick: Repel the boarders!
SpongeBob: [salutes] Repelling boarders, sir! [throws a package at the mailman, sending him flying off]
Mail woman: Harold! [a package is thrown at her as well, also sending her flying] Whee!
[SpongeBob observes the mail trucks behind them.]
SpongeBob: [pulling a level] I'm shipping these COD: [the mail truck raises its back end and litters all of the mail onto the road] Crash on delivery.
[The two mail trucks slip and crash into each other. The mail helicopter swoops in, frightening SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: [noticing the mail bag next to him] And here comes some air mail. [puts all of the mail from the bag into bis mouth and turns into a cannon]
[SpongeBob shoots the mail onto the windshield of the helicopter, making the mail driver scream. The helicopter tilts to the side.]
Kevin: [picks up an envelope and reads it] Huh? Another jury summons for Bubble Bass. [crumples up the letter and throws it into a barrel]
[The helicopter comes by and slices the barrel in half, revealing Bubble Bass huddled inside. He runs away. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick are still being chased by mail trucks.]
Patrick: Special delivery!
SpongeBob: [about to throw more mail, but notices something] Oh, all we have left is junk mail!
Patrick: [off-screen] Don't worry. They'll never find us in this post office.
[Their mail truck enters the post office, and the envelope door closes. The mail trucks stop. Envelope transition to the mailman on crutches, trudging his way to the entrance to the Bikini Bottom Jail. He rings the doorbell and a foghorn sounds. The door opens to reveal a jail warden.]
Mailman: Here's today's [holds out a giant envelope with SpongeBob and Patrick inside] mail, warden.

SpongeBob walks over to a toy chest and starts rummaging through it, but does not find anything that interests him or Patrick. It is then revealed that they are in Squidward's house, and he kicks them out.They then begin walking outside, trying to find something to do. While they are walking, they notice some billboards that begin to introduce something. They follow the signs to a newly opened store called Toy Barrel. At first, it is not there, which makes the two of them cry. It appears soon afterward, courtesy of a crane. The construction worker throws Patrick inside, and SpongeBob throws himself inside as well.SpongeBob and Patrick spend the entire day singing songs and playing with the toys, and SpongeBob was in a mantu. all the while annoying an employee. Later, it comes to their disappointment that the Toy Barrel will be closing for the night. Not wanting to leave the store, Patrick formulates a plan to hide in the dollhouses. When the security guard checks the toy store during the night, Patrick and SpongeBob go undiscovered.After revealing themselves, the two realize they have the whole store to themselves. They become jolly until the lights suddenly turn off, which scares the duo. They begin searching for a source of light until Patrick remembers he has a flashlight trapped inside his head. The light begins to shine from Patrick's eyes until it quickly burns out.The two of them then become scared as they imagine the toys to be hideous creatures. They then see a big shadowy figure walking towards them, which frightens them further. SpongeBob decides they need to fight back against this supposed threat.They enter the ladies restroom and dress up like soldiers, preparing to fight the shadow. They attempt to fight with bubbles. They dipped their wands, puffed out their cheeks as big as they can, then blew a bunch of bubbles at the shadow. This does them no good, however, as they completely missed. As the figure approaches, they see and realize it was just a little wind-up robot Patrick had been playing with earlier. They feel relived until Patrick decides to wind up the toy again, and as it starts walking, the two get frightened and run out of the store.Upon exiting the Toy Barrel, they tell the children waiting outside not to go in due to the horrors that await them inside. They are then made aware that the toy store is just opening up for the morning. Finally, Patrick rushes back inside while exclaiming his love for toys, finishing the episode.",Toy Store of Doom,"[SpongeBob and Patrick are relaxing on Squidward's couch, both looking bored]

Old Man Walker: Hello.
Patrick: Uh-uh.
SpongeBob: [tosses Old Man Walker aside, then falls into the chest and re-emerges with action figures] Hey, we could play with our Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy action figures! Ew. Barnacle Boy's all chewed up. And slimy.
Patrick: [chewing on a Mermaid Man action figure] Yeah, that'll happen.
SpongeBob: [tosses Barnacle Boy aside, wipes his hand, and wades through toys] Ugh, there is just nothing to play with.
Patrick: There's gotta be something we can do.

SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. Can you think of anything fun we can do?
Squidward: Get out!

SpongeBob: Patrick, we have to leave.
Patrick: Huh! I'm not moving.
SpongeBob: But they'll just come and kick us out!
Patrick: Not if we hide.
SpongeBob: Hide? Isn't that kind of sneaky?
Patrick: Oh, it's sneaky alright. Really sneaky. C'mon, haven't you always wanted to have a toy store all to yourself?
SpongeBob: No. But I do now. What do we do first?!

The other customers go up to Plankton as he runs out of the restaurant in discomfort soon afterwards. At the Chum Bucket, Plankton complains to Karen about everyone finding him adorable when he wants to be seen as evil, which gives him the idea to build a robot, Q.T.-π, that will eat anyone who says ""aww!""

While everyone goes for the rides, SpongeBob comforts Q.T.-π, having been left alone. He gets the idea to use it for a ride, with its mechanism of eating people used for the entertainment.

Plankton: Of course another failure! How am I supposed to steal the Krabby Patty formula when everybody thinks I'm adorable? Cute is no way to inspire fear! Unless...

When people see it, they'll have to say, ""Awww!"" [jumps off and onto the floor.

Plankton: Behold! Revenge-Bot Model Q.T.-π!
[A yellow robot duck is revealed with red blushing cheeks and a light blue bowtie below its neck. The robot quacks.]
Plankton: Yes!
Karen: Did you say it was going to eat people ?

Karen: [makes an unfazed face] Well have fun with your little toy. Just don't forget to take out the trash. [exits]
Plankton: [sad face and disappointed voice] Awww!
[Plankton has accidentally triggered the duck robot, causing it to transform into a giant terrifying monster intent on eating Plankton. It then opens up its mouth and screams as light is projected from its mouth. Plankton turns around and faces the robot.]
Plankton: [fearful] Oh boy...
[The robot eats Plankton and swallows him, causing Plankton to scream until he lands face-down on a pink metal floor and slightly fractures his bones. He lifts his face up from off the ground and gets back up in joy to reveal aloud that his invention worked.]
Plankton: It works! It- huh? [realizes that he is trapped inside with no way out as the exit from atop the robot's mouth closes, causing him to fall into a feeling of despair] Barnacles...
[Q.T.-π breaks the top of the Chum Bucket along with the doors and roars as he intends to terrorize the rest of Bikini Bottom. Suddenly, he reverts to his original small cute duck form and falls to the ground, quacking again. He follows SpongeBob, who is skipping to work.]
SpongeBob: [skipping] I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! [Just as he is about to enter the Krusty Krab, he gets distracted by the wind blowing off his hat] Whoa! [grabs his hat and puts it back on] Huh...
Plankton (as Q.T.-π): [Plankton's voice is heard from inside the robot as he is down in its stomach] Excellent! That moron won't be able to stop ""Awww""ing at my robot! Go robot! Eat him. Eat him good, baby!
[Plankton laughs menacingly. Q.T.-π makes an adorable quacking sound. SpongeBob's eyes emerge from his back as he confronts the duck behind him.]
SpongeBob: Huh? Aaaaaaaa...
[As SpongeBob continuously says ""aaaaaa,"" Plankton gets excited over the intended outcome.]
Plankton: Here it comes!
SpongeBob: ....aaaaaaa.... cute little robot like you shouldn't be out here all alone! [he is not eaten due to changing his sentence; he grabs the robot and puts it in his palm] What's your name? [looks at the name inscribed on the robot's bowtie, which a close-up reveals is Q.T.-π] Q.T.-π? That's adorable! Come on, I'll take care of you until we find your owner.
[SpongeBob walks into the Krusty Krab while carrying the robot.]
Plankton (as Q.T.-π): [evilly] Yes, that's right, take us right into my enemy's lair...
SpongeBob: [giving Q.T.-π a tour of the Krusty Krab] This is where I work, these are our customers, [pokes a couple's eyes, causing them to squint and grunt] and this is Squidward, my best friend!
[SpongeBob pokes Squidward's head while he is napping, wearing a sleep mask in his workstation, causing Squidward to wake up startled.]
Squidward: Huh?! Huh?! Wh-wh- That is a filthy lie! [slaps SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [looks at his hands] Ooh, speaking of filthy, [puts the duck in Squidward's hands to hold onto while he goes off to wash his hands in the bathroom] I better wash these dirty hands before I get cooking.
[A close-up of SpongeBob's hands are shown, sparkling clean, contrary to his claims.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, be a dear and keep an eye on him for me, will you?
[SpongeBob smiles flamboyantly and then walks off. Squidward groans in displeasure, before being shocked that the duck is talking to him. The duck quacks at Squidward. Squidward takes off his sleep mask.]
Squidward: Say, you are pretty cute.
Incidental 82: Did you say ""cute""?!
Squidward: Um, uh...
[A crowd of customers walk up to Squidward's workstation and surround him while trying to get a good look at the duck. This makes Squidward uncomfortable and he gets out a golf club to push the customers out of his way and threaten them.]
Squidward: Okay, get back you animals! [steps out of the boat] He needs room to be precious.
[Q.T.-π spins around while quacking and sticks his tongue out. Squidward and the customers take a deep breath and say ""Awww!"" upon breathing out.]
Squidward and customers: Awww!
[They have triggered the robot's transformation into a monster. It first eats Squidward, who screams in terror. It then eats Incidental 85 and the other elderly lady fish. The burly woman fish grabs a table and Harold the blue fish grabs a barrel seat; they throw them at the robot, who eats both of them subsequently. Mr. Krabs hears the ruckus and storms out to solve the problem.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, those don't sound like ""I'm spending money!"" screams! [he looks up and notices the monstrous robot] Wha-?
[Q.T.-π grabs Mr. Krabs with his tongue and eats him, even though he didn't say ""Awww."" The robot continues to terrorize the Krusty Krab by breaking the poles and throwing Krabby Patties against the wall. SpongeBob comes out of the bathroom and is wiping his hands with a paper towel.]
SpongeBob: Proper drying of the hands is every bit as important as the- whaaaaaay?
[SpongeBob sees that the Krusty Krab is a mess and everyone is gone. Q.T.-π has returned to his normal form and quacks.]
SpongeBob: Huh, guess we closed early today... Oh boy, now I have more time to help my new friend Q.T.-π! [grabs the robot and squeezes it against his cheek] La la la la la la la, la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la!
[SpongeBob exits the Krusty Krab. The scene changes to the inside of Q.T.-π's mouth. Mr. Krabs is shown falling inside and screaming until he lands face-down on the floor while Squidward and the fish watch in concern. He lifts his injured face up as he looks around in confusion.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? What in the name of Neptune is going on here?
Plankton: [squished, he gets up from underneath Mr. Krabs' butt] [pretends not to know what is going on by putting on a mocking tone] Oh, yeah! What is happening here?
Mr. Krabs: [grabs Plankton with his claws] Plankton... This has ""you"" written all over it.
Plankton: How dare you?!
[Mr. Krabs pushes everyone aside and shows Plankton the sign which reads ""Property of Chum Bucket"" to prove he was the one who trapped everyone.]
Plankton: Heh, how'd that get on there? [Mr. Krabs pulls him away from the sign. Plankton stands up in Krabs' palm to confess to his misdeed] Okay, it was me. To teach you all a lesson, I made a robot that eats people who say, ""Awww!"" So sue me.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I don't wanna sue you, Plankton. [increases his voice and yells at Plankton, who falls out of Mr. Krabs' hand] I wanna get out of your infernal contraption!
Plankton: Well, the only way out is the emergency evacuation uvula. Which is, [points up] up there...
[A close-up of a uvula wiggling with an emergency sign below is shown while a gulping sound is heard.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? Alright, you heard the pipsqueak. Everyone farm up! Let's yank that uvular!
[Everyone piles up onto each other to reach the uvula, but it turns out they don't have enough people. When Mr. Krabs throws Plankton up into the air, he falls down and causes everyone to disassemble their balance and follow suit. Everyone groans in pain.]
Plankton: Looks like we're stuck here, until this dumb robot eats more people.
[Everyone groans. Bubble transition. SpongeBob is shown walking into a vet while carrying Q.T.-π.]
SpongeBob: The veterinarian can help me find your owner. You're a robot, so you must be chipped .
[SpongeBob laughs as he enters. The scene then changes to him sitting on a vet chair while a blue female veterinarian examines the robot.]
Veterinarian: Hmmm... Normally, I work with animals, not machines. But, how different can they be? [chuckles] Let's just take a listen.
[She puts the stethoscope onto the robot's stomach. Squidward and Mr. Krabs' voices are heard from inside.]
Squidward: Say ""Awww!""
Mr. Krabs: Get eaten!
Plankton: Say ""Awww!""
Veterinarian: [shocked] Oh my! [gets out tongue depressor] Okay then! Say ""Awww!""
Q.T.-π: [opens his beak] Awww...
[The veterinarian puts the depressor in the duck's mouth. The robot's monstrous transformation is triggered and the vet looks in shock as her pupils change in appearance to display the transformation. She attempts to grab her emergency handbag, but is taken and eaten by the robot before she can do anything. SpongeBob sits there smiling with no awareness of what is going on. The hospital is now destroyed aside from the flooring and seats.]
SpongeBob: Awww... No, wait, I mean to say... Ahhhhh!
[SpongeBob runs off screaming in horror. The robot chases after him and eats several of the Bottomite houses. Suddenly, the robot goes back to its cute form.]
SpongeBob: D'ow cute!
[SpongeBob continues screaming and running even when the robot remains in its cute and harmless form. He runs into Glove World! without purchasing a ticket. Incidental 41 is working at the ticket booth and waves a ticket around to emphasize SpongeBob's trespassing.]
Incidental 41: Wha-? Hey! You need to buy a ticket! [looks in front of him and sees Q.T.-π] Awww!
[The robot then goes back to its terrifying form, causing Incidental 41 to scream and close the windows in his booth. He pokes his arms and legs through the booth and attempts to run off, but is eaten by the robot, causing him to scream. The robot reverts to its cute form afterward and continues following SpongeBob, who is still screaming. Tons of fish are running around screaming and a group of anchovies gets eaten. The robot vacuums everyone in sight up then eats a trash can that someone is hiding in. Incidentals are shown riding on a rollercoaster. Once it gets to the steep end, Q.T.-π appears and opens his mouth to eat all the fish. SpongeBob continues running away, but is cornered in front of the gift shop. However, he then notices an alley and plans his escape through there.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, perfect! [talks to the camera and points toward the alley] I'll escape through there! [runs through the alley but grunts as he hits a brick wall with a sign that reads, ""Dead End the Ride""] A dead-end ride? That doesn't seem very glove-themed. [hears quacking] Hmm? Huh?! [panics as the duck has found him] Ahhh, Q.T.-π! Please don't eat me!
Everyone inside: Eat him! Eat him!
SpongeBob: [gets an idea] Ooh, I know! I'll try the soothing power of music ... [gets out a ukulele with ""Love"" and a heart symbol written on it and starts playing a tune] Ohhh...
[The ukulele strings break off as he uses the pick on a first try.]
SpongeBob: Awww, rats!
[The usage of ""Awww"" triggers the robot and causes him to eat SpongeBob, who falls inside and screams until he lands on his face. He gets his face up off the ground and looks around in confusion. Everyone is cheering upon his arrival.]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah, good boy!
SpongeBob: A surprise party... for me ?!
Plankton: [gets off from underneath SpongeBob and grunts] This isn't a party, you boob.
SpongeBob: Well why did everyone cheer when I showed up?!
Mr. Krabs: Because with you, we can finally reach the emergency escape uvular! [Mr. Krabs points up to the uvula] Alright, let's try it again, people!
[Everyone piles up again.]
Fish: He can do it! He can do it!
[SpongeBob climbs up and stands on Patrick's back to grab the uvula. As he attempts to grab it, his arms are too short. Suddenly, a shaking sound is heard, implying something big. The height of the pile towers up, and SpongeBob tries again. He finally succeeds in grabbing the uvula and causes the robot to spin around and malfunction. A circular opening in the robot's butt is shown with everyone squished up inside. Everyone inside is freed and released into the sky as fireworks as Q.T.-π collapses. The fish from before are launched back onto the rollercoaster and cheer. Everyone else falls back onto the ground, while Squidward falls into the ice cream cart.]
Mr. Krabs: We did it! We escaped!
Plankton: [shown between Mr. Krabs' butt cheeks] And I got us sent to Glove World! for free . You're wel-come!
Squidward: [emerges from the ice cream] Last one on the Bumper Gloves is a rotten egg!
[Everyone cheers and races Squidward to the Bumper Gloves ride as they create a giant cloud of dust. Q.T.-π observes as he has returned to his original cute form.]
Q.T.-π: [sadly mourns being left alone while everyone has fun] Awww...
[A glove balloon appears floating down next to him. SpongeBob is revealed to be floating on it, until he lands on the ground and pops it. He is also wearing a glove hat.]
SpongeBob: [sympathetic] Poor Q.T.-π. That whole eating everyone thing didn't work out for you. [gets an idea] I think I know how you could use your powers for good!
[SpongeBob grabs another glove hat and points to it while enlightening Q.T.-π. He puts it onto the robot's head. Q.T.-π quacks. Bubble transition. Q.T.-π is shown inside a new ride called the ""Glove Launch.""]
Employee: Step right up and try our new glove-tastic ride! Experience the 'awww'-pocalypse! [opens the line for everyone to enter] At the Glove Launch!
[A teenage boy fish then walks up and sticks his tongue out to blow raspberries at Q.T.-π.]
Teenage fish: Awww...
[The fish has triggered the monstrous transformation and is eaten by the duck as he screams. He is then released through the duck's bottom opening and sent flying through several fire rings before landing on a roll of toilet paper. He then grunts as he lands in a toilet with Marina (who has a fire-lit plunger on her head) and two other teenage fish, one a boy and the other a girl.]
Teen fish: Alright, yeah-yeah-yeah!
[He and the rest of the fish cheer as they are flushed down the toilet. A line for the Glove Launch ride is shown. Plankton is being denied admission on account of being too short. He is standing next to a ""Must Be This Tall to Ride"" sign.]
Plankton: What do you mean I'm too short to ride this ride? I built this-
Employee: [sounding tired] Sorry, buddy, rules is rules. [squishes Plankton's cheeks] Even for an adorable little guy like you.
Plankton: Real cute.

He notices Mrs. Puff heading towards Squidward's house. SpongeBob greets her, to which she replies to get SpongeBob not to notice her. SpongeBob sees Plankton, Bubble Bass, and Incidental 154, to which they also try not be noticed. Squidward lets the four of them in and organizes a 'We Hate SpongeBob Club' meeting. They recite their motto and ask to share their painful memories with SpongeBob. Squidward hears SpongeBob and notices him outside his window, but tries to ignore him. Mrs. Puff asks to share her misfortune first, so Squidward gives her a ""speaking sponge.""A flashback is shown with Mrs. Puff and her student Bertie Fitzpatrick. Bertie passes her driver's test and Mrs. Puff gives her a license. Bertie compliments her teaching skills, but SpongeBob soon shows up menacingly. He grabs Bertie's license and scratches it on his body. Bertie tries to take the license back, but is flung out of the boat. Mrs. Puff tries to escape from the boat, but SpongeBob takes control of the boat and drives crazily. SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff are flung back by a stop sign and they crash into the Boating School. As the flashback ends, Mrs. Puff cries and Squidward soon comforts her. SpongeBob attempts to enter Squidward's house again, but Incidental 154 kicks him out.Bubble Bass calls to share his moment next and asks for the sponge. A flashback at the Krusty Krab is shown, where SpongeBob delivers Bubble Bass's lunch order, featuring Krabby Patties, fries, and a hot dog. SpongeBob hopes Bubble Bass will enjoy his lunch, but takes away his fries and soda after he notices they are not perfect. SpongeBob then takes away a Krabby Patty and Bubble Bass chases him through the restaurant while SpongeBob continues noticing issues with his meal. Bubble Bass grabs the Krabby Patty off SpongeBob and eats it, but SpongeBob goes inside of him and gets the patty back after coming out of Bubble Bass's belly button. Bubble Bass runs out of the restaurant as the flashback ends.Plankton grabs a sponge to tell his story next. A flashback at the Chum Bucket is shown. Plankton works on an invention, which is shown to be toilet paper wrapped around dynamite. Plankton hears SpongeBob laughing, and he soon shows up in the Chum Bucket lab. SpongeBob takes control of Karen's mainframe, with Karen trying to get rid of him. SpongeBob causes a spill of chum, to which Plankton and Karen slip on, ending up locked outside the Chum Bucket. As the flashback ends, SpongeBob's laughter is heard, but Squidward is able to calm down his air conditioner.Squidward then tells his story with SpongeBob, taking place in real time. At that moment, Squidward opens his front door, to which no one is seen. However, SpongeBob shows up inside his house, asking for salt water. He greets everyone inside the house and learns of the club, but is unaware of the fact it's a vendetta against him and compliments on all the members. Patrick is also seen inside, drinking punch from a bowl. SpongeBob agrees to make pineapple punch using the walls of his house. As he comes back, he trips over Squidward, indirectly causing a fire inside his house. Everyone runs out, except SpongeBob and Squidward. While Squidward's house is being put out, SpongeBob offers for the rest of the meeting to be held at his house. SpongeBob volunteers to be the speaking sponge, to which Incidental 154 uses him as one. The episode ends with Squidward closing the meeting in the remains of his own home.",Sea-Man Sponge Haters Club,"[The episode opens with a shot of SpongeBob's house. He opens the door, carrying a large bag of garbage.]
SpongeBob: Oh, we had some good times, Trashy, but you're gonna love the dump! You'll make so many trashy new friends!
[A bit of garbage leaks from the bag and drops on SpongeBob's nose. He laughs. SpongeBob extends his foot to hold up his trash can, then puts the bag inside and pulls his foot back in.]
SpongeBob: [patting the bag] I'm gonna miss you! [suddenly notices something] Huh?
[Mrs. Puff, in a brown coat, is walking towards Squidward's house.]
SpongeBob: [waving] Hi, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: [in disguise] I'm not here!
SpongeBob: Oops! [winks and points] My mistake.
[Plankton, the mailman and Bubble Bass follow behind Mrs. Puff, also in brown coats and glasses.]
SpongeBob: [waving] Hi, Plankton! Hi, Bubble Bass! [his nose turns into an extra hand, which he waves] Hi, Mr. Mailman!
Plankton, Bubble Bass, and Mailman: [raising one hand] We're not here!
SpongeBob: Hmm, maybe I need glasses. [takes off his eyes, blows on them, rubs them with his elbow, and then puts them back on his face]
[Mrs. Puff knocks on Squidward's door. He peers through a gap in the door, then opens it and motions for everyone to come in. Inside Squidward's house, everyone is seated around a table. Squidward holds a gavel and has a bucket of sponges next to him.]
Squidward: Fellow sponge sufferers, the 431st ""We Hate SpongeBob"" club will now come to order. [bangs the gavel] And now, our motto.
Plankton, Bubble Bass, Mailman, Mrs. Puff, and Squidward: [raising one hand] We don't mean SpongeBob any harm. We just can't stand him.
Squidward: Does anyone have any new sponge pain they would like to share?
[The members stick their hands out, all talking over each other.]
Mrs. Puff: How much time do you have?
Plankton: I do!
Bubble Bass: Oh, yes. I do.
Mailman: I have to unwrap my package of pain!
[Suddenly, SpongeBob is heard laughing.]
Squidward: Huh? [the members retract their hands as Squidward motions for them to stop] Hold that agony. [looks to his right to see SpongeBob at the window]
SpongeBob: Hello, Squidward!
Squidward: [grunts, pulls the window blinds down, then faces the group] Proceed.
Mrs. Puff: [clears her throat] I have some misfortune to share.
Squidward: The chair recognizes Sufferer Puff. [grabs a sponge] Please receive the speaking sponge. [hands her the sponge]
Mrs. Puff: [nervously kneading the sponge] It all began last week.
[In Mrs. Puff's story, she and a young girl with braces drive through a colorful landscape of lollipops and rainbows.]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] I was enjoying one of my favorite things. [their car parks in front of Mrs. Puff's Boating School] Awarding a student their driver's license. [holds up a license] You've passed your driver's exam, Bertie! [Bertie is excited] Congratulations! [close-up on the license, which sparkles]
Bertie: [takes the license] I couldn't have done it without you, Mrs. Puff! I bet you can teach anyone!
Mrs. Puff: [blushes] Oh ho ho, aww!
[The background turns orange and a shadow is cast as SpongeBob suddenly appears from the middle of the boat, laughing ominously.]
Mrs. Puff: Almost anyone.
[SpongeBob, with a grotesquely detailed face and hands, slides up to Bertie.]
SpongeBob: Nice license. [getting closer] Can I touch it? [takes her license and rubs it on himself, laughing creepily. Bertie looks scared]
Bertie: Eww, gross! [tries to take her license from SpongeBob, but he keeps holding on. Bertie grabs her license too hard and is flung backwards out of the boat, then screams and crashes offscreen]
SpongeBob: Well, looks like you have an opening in your schedule, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: I tried to leave [the boat's doors lock] , but we all know there is [a purple spiral appears in her eyes over a swirling background] no escape from [SpongeBob morphs into a disturbing Rat Fink-style version of himself] SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob laughs crazily, then sticks his foot through the boat and then speeds up the boat. The landscape is now dark and barren.]
SpongeBob: Accelerate safely into traffic!
[SpongeBob speeds and twists the road into a knot.]
SpongeBob: [spins the steering wheel] Now for a 360 point turn!
[The boat spins out of control, but hits a stop sign, causing the landscape to go back to normal.]
SpongeBob: Oops! Almost ran a stop sign! [gets flung backwards by the stop sign] Whoaaa!
Mrs. Puff: Whoaaa! [the boat hits the Boating School lighthouse] Aaaah! [the lighthouse tips over, causing the Boating School to explode]
Mrs. Puff: [narrating] SpongeBob destroyed [fade back to her in Squidward's house, having twisted the sponge into a knot] my beautiful school! [tears the sponge] Just like last week! [cries, and Squidward puts a purple blanket over her]
Squidward: It's okay. We're here for you. [holding up another sponge] Who would like to share next?
SpongeBob: [sticking his head through the mail slot] I would! I'd like to share a hug!
Mailman: [sticks a package in SpongeBob's mouth and kicks him] Looks like you could use a stamp!
Bubble Bass: I believe that I am next in the roundelay. My speaking sponge, please? [Squidward holds one out. Bubble Bass looks displeased, but takes it anyways.] I was at the Krusty Krab [fades in to Bubble Bass sitting at a table in the Krusty Krab] to grab a light snack between first and second lunch.
[SpongeBob walks up, holding a large plate of food.]
SpongeBob: Order up, o valued customer!
Bubble Bass: Ah. Finally. [puts on bib] Sustenance for my starving stomach!
SpongeBob: [detailed close-up on his face] I hope it's perfect!
[Bubble Bass is about to eat a fry, but then SpongeBob gasps as he grabs his arm.]
Bubble Bass: Huh? [SpongeBob takes the fry away from him]
SpongeBob: It's not perfect! [bends the fry, causing grease to splatter and hit Bubble Bass] It's too greasy!
[Bubble Bass grabs another fry. SpongeBob jumps up and takes it.]
SpongeBob: And this fry isn't greasy enough! [blows flour from it in Bubble Bass' face]
Bubble Bass: Try as I might, [coughing] SpongeBob would not let me consume a single calorie! [drinking soda] I tried to take a sip of soda to slake my thirst!
[SpongeBob gasps and pulls out a straw from one of his pores. He sticks the straw in Bubble Bass' mouth and sucks the soda out, then tastes it and swallows.] Not fizzy enough!
[Bubble Bass squeezes the soda in frustration. He grabs a Krabby Patty.]
Bubble Bass: That perforated pest wouldn't let me taste a morsel of Krabby Patty!
[As Bubble Bass is about to bite into the Krabby Patty, SpongeBob grabs it. Bubble Bass bites his tongue and screams.]
Bubble Bass: Give me back my patty, you festering fusspot!
SpongeBob: [gasps] I can't! [He runs away, and Bubble Bass follows him.] The sesame seeds are misaligned! And the lettuce has too many wrinkles! The tomato has lost its sheen!
Bubble Bass: Let me eat, you insufferable interrupter!
[Bubble Bass jumps and lands on SpongeBob, then takes the Krabby Patty from him.]
Bubble Bass: Victory is mine! [eats the patty and swallows, then laughs]
SpongeBob: [weary noises, then his eyes bug out] Awooga!
[SpongeBob jumps into Bubble Bass' mouth, struggling. Bubble Bass swallows him and smacks his lips.]
Bubble Bass: A tad spongy, but not bad! [He holds up the Krabby Patty and is about to bite it, but his stomach rumbles.] That fry cook has given me a slight case of indigestion! [His stomach rumbles even louder. SpongeBob comes out of his belly button.]
SpongeBob: [holding up Krabby Patty] I shall let no customer eat a less-than-perfect patty! [pats his head] Oh! [He reaches into Bubble Bass' belly button again and takes out his employee hat.] Ahh! [to Bubble Bass] I forgot my hat!
[Bubble Bass runs out of the Krusty Krab, screaming. Fade to him in Squidward's house, eating the speaking sponge.]
Bubble Bass: That squishy simpleton left my navel [close-up on Bubble Bass' knotted belly button, as a woman screams] in knots!
Plankton: [taking a sponge from the box and dragging it to his seat] You call that suffering? I'll tell you a truly terrifying tale... [fade to the exterior of the Chum Bucket, on a stormy night] It was a dark and spongy night!
[Plankton is seen, in silhouette, hitting something with a hammer.]
Plankton: [narrating] I was working peacefully in my lab on my newest invention to... uh... help fishkind? Yeah, that's it. [throws the hammer away] Yes! My terrible [holds up a stick of dynamite with a roll of toilet paper around it] toilet paper will wipe Bikini Bottom off the face of the ocean! [laughs, then pats the toilet paper] Plus, it's quilted! [laughs, but is interrupted by SpongeBob's laughter.]
[The lab's doors are seen swinging open.]
Plankton: [shrugs] Eh. [evil laugh]
[SpongeBob is heard laughing, along with some bubbling, as the scene cuts to a barrel of chum.]
Plankton: Why does something always ruin a good evil laugh? [SpongeBob's laughter grows louder.] But then, I saw it!
[A tall cylinder in the corner of the room tips over. SpongeBob appears from behind it, flying around like a bird and smashing into walls.]
Plankton: [narrating] A wild SpongeBob had gotten in to my lab!
SpongeBob: [bird calls]
Plankton: [shouting] Karen! It got in again! [Karen appears, holding two brooms, through a laser-cut hole in the wall.]
Karen: Did you leave the window open again?
[SpongeBob crashes into the wall, then the floor. He jumps up to Karen's monitor, then squeezes inside.]
Karen: [gasps] It's in my mainframe!
[SpongeBob appears as a pixelated image on Karen's screen, then exits.]
Karen: Oh, you dirty bird! Get down from there! [She swings the broom at him, but hits Plankton instead.]
SpongeBob: [scared bird call]
[Karen nearly hits him with the broom, and he flies off. Karen presses on Plankton.]
Karen: Come on, lazy bones! Sweep it out the door!
Plankton: [groans]
[SpongeBob flies away, tipping over a barrel of chum. Karen and Plankton run at him with their brooms. They slip on the chum and end up outside the restaurant, falling in a puddle. The doors slam shut. SpongeBob laughs as Plankton tries to open the door.]
Plankton: He's locked us out! [cries as SpongeBob keeps laughing, and lightning strikes]
[In Squidward's living room, Plankton is punching a speaking sponge.]
Plankton: So if you hear that horrible sound of a SpongeBob, just run! [the sponge falls over and crushes him] Ow! [muffled] Run for your lives!
[SpongeBob's laughter is heard, as the group looks shocked. Squidward walks up to a square machine that resembles SpongeBob.]
Squidward: Calm down. My AC is just acting up again. [hits the AC, causing it to stop making noise]
Mrs. Puff: [fanning herself] Ooh, ooh!
Plankton: Phew!
Bubble Bass: Phew!
Mailman: Thank Neptune!
Squidward: You think you all have it bad? [takes sponge from basket] Wait until you hear my tale of spongy terror... [takes out clock] in real time. [his eyes turn into numbers] Three, two, one... [the doorbell rings] He had arrived!
[Squidward opens the door. The group gasps. Nobody is outside.]
Squidward: But there was no one there! Perhaps... it was nothing! Or was SpongeBob already in the house?
[SpongeBob shows up holding a small measuring cup, his eyes spaced far apart. The lighting briefly goes dark.]
SpongeBob: Could I borrow a cup of saltwater?
Squidward: [sighs, then takes the cup and swishes it in the air, before thrusting it into SpongeBob's shirt] Here. [SpongeBob walks away] Of course, the saltwater was just a ruse to come inside uninvited.
SpongeBob: [puts his arm around the mailman] Ooh! Are you having a party?
Squidward: Naturally, SpongeBob lost no time annoying everyone in the room!
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff! I can't wait until my next lesson!
Mrs. Puff: Ew...
SpongeBob: Mailman, I gotta tell ya! Every package from you is a special delivery! Let's catch up soon, huh?
Mailman: Uh...
SpongeBob: Looking fit, Bubble Bass! [flexes] Been pumping the iron, huh? [picks up Plankton's chair and flicks his antenna] And Plankton, has anyone ever told you that you have the loveliest eye?
Squidward: Of course, if SpongeBob was around, [camera pans to show Patrick standing behind Squidward] his pointy pink pal couldn't be far behind. [Patrick drinks a bowl of punch, including the ladle]
Patrick: You're out of punch!
[Squidward growls in anger.]
SpongeBob: [walking to the door] Don't worry, Squidward! I'll mix up a batch of my special pineapple punch!
[Squidward growls in anger, holding a sponge, then rushes towards him. SpongeBob is standing in the doorway.]
SpongeBob: It's homemade! Made out of the walls of my home.
[Camera pans to the exterior of SpongeBob's house, then back to him laughing. He shuts the door, and Squidward slams into it. He pops back out, onto the floor, with the speaking sponge falling into his hand.]
Squidward: And no SpongeBob story would be complete without him destroying something!
SpongeBob: [entering while holding a bowl] I've got pineapple puuu-- [trips over Squidward] Whoa!
[The punch lands on the air conditioner, which short circuits and lights on fire. The club members run out of the house, screaming.]
SpongeBob: Ooops. [walks away slowly]
Squidward: [holds up sponge and drops it] The end.
[Bubble transition to the next scene with firefighters putting out Squidward's burning house. The club members, SpongeBob, and Patrick stand outside, with Patrick still drinking punch.]
Mrs. Puff: Where are we gonna finish our club meeting now?
SpongeBob: [clears throat] I know a place you could have your meeting! [He gestures to his house. The club members groan.]
[Bubble transition to the next scene with the members in SpongeBob's house, besides Squidward, sitting on his couch. Patrick sits on a chair, and SpongeBob brings in a plate of food.]
SpongeBob: Who's ready for hors d'oeuvres? Watch out for the--
[Patrick takes the plate and devours its contents. The toothpicks stick out of his mouth.]
SpongeBob: ...toothpicks.
Bubble Bass: Phooey. [holds up empty basket] We're all out of speaking sponges.
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Oh, no, you're not! There's one left! [Cut to a detailed close-up of SpongeBob posing. Sponge transition to him now being twisted by the mailman and laughing.]
Mailman: And I was [coughs out letters] coughing up his mail for weeks! [coughs out more letters]
[Pan to Squidward in the remains of his house, still sitting in his chair and holding a gavel.]
Squidward: I declare this meeting of the We Hate SpongeBob Club... adjourned. Bang.

Although he says that the burger is not as good as a Krabby Patty, he appreciates the convenience of not having to move, which gives Mr. Krabs the idea to bring the Krusty Krab to the customers. He takes SpongeBob and Squidward outside to show them a Krusty Krab food truck and he asks them to sell Krabby Patties to customers they approach. Mr. Krabs makes Squidward drive the truck, with SpongeBob agreeing to serve as navigation.SpongeBob and Squidward drive through Bikini Bottom, attempting to sell Krabby Patties to customers, including construction workers, but they are unsuccessful, with other food trucks continually getting in their way. They approach Lady Upturn at her mansion, but she refuses to buy a Krabby Patty due to how cheap they are. She calls for a canapé truck that pushes the two away. Without having sold a single Krabby Patty in Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob and Squidward explore their last destination: Rock Bottom.SpongeBob and Squidward drive through the streets of Rock Bottom, as well as the Rock Bottom Mall, circus, and cemetery. They initially see no one in sight, until SpongeBob spots Bert under a streetlight on the side of the road. He and Squidward try to sell a Krabby Patty to him, but he mysteriously disappears. They chase him throughout Rock Bottom, failing to catch up to him. They see him swing around a streetlight, but he disappears again. SpongeBob tries using jellyfishing to his advantage, and he and Squidward also set a trap, but they get stung by jellyfish after both attempts.SpongeBob and Squidward reach a bus stop, and they slide out of the food truck to rest on a bench. Bert approaches them and angrily asks them why they were chasing after him. SpongeBob asks him why he was waving at them, but Bert reveals that he was drying his armpits. SpongeBob explains that they were only trying to sell a Krabby Patty to him. He almost agrees to buy one, until a bus approaches, revealing that the other Rock Bottomites went to the Krusty Krab. Incidental 222 gives Bert a Krusty Krab meal. Bert then tells SpongeBob and Squidward he no longer needs to buy from them.Back at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is shown with a wheelbarrow of money, mentioning that he has gained them from Rock Bottomites. SpongeBob and Squidward arrive, and Mr. Krabs asks how they did. SpongeBob replies that they have not sold any Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs gets really infuriated until saying that he has not eaten anything throughout the day. Squidward gives Mr. Krabs a Krabby Patty, but asks him to pay. SpongeBob and Squidward claim that as a successful sale as Mr. Krabs eats the Krabby Patty. He says it tastes awful and throws the Krabby Patty against the food truck, only for it to collapse on him, as the episode ends.",Food PBFFT! Truck,"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab, which is busy with customers.]
Mr. Krabs: Woo-hoo! Me restaurant is packed to the gills with customers and their money! [laughs]
[A crowd of customers run up to Squidward and give him their money. He puts it in the cash register, which overflows and the money flies out.]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, the register is full again.
Mr. Krabs: I got it, Mr. Squidward. [vacuums up the loose money as he laughs] Ooh. [vacuums up one extra dollar from inside Squidward's nose] Ooh, hmm. [walks outside of the restaurant and steals money from the long line of customers. He sees Incidental 37A standing outside.] Hey, why aren't you in line? Don't you want a Krabby Patty?
Incidental 37A: I'd love one, but it's so far away. [A food truck appears and gives him a burger and a drink. He takes a bite of the burger.] Not quite as good as a Krabby Patty, but I didn't have to move one inch. [He takes another bite of the burger and walks away.]
Mr. Krabs: [angrily] That food truck stole me customer. Well, if the customers won't come to the Krusty Krab, I'll bring the Krusty Krab to them.
[Bubble transition to the next scene, where SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward are outside the Krusty Krab. There is also a large object covered by a curtain.]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, what are we doing out here?
Mr. Krabs: Your generous employer has a surprise for you.
SpongeBob: [His irises turn into hearts while jumping in the air.] I love your surprises, Mr. Krabs! My favorite surprise was the rubber check. [He pulls a check made out of rubber from his pocket and bounces it on the ground.]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, that was a good one. [He pulls the curtain off the large object revealing it is a Krusty Krab food truck.] Behold! Me brand new to me food truck, the Krusty Kruiser. [He taps the truck and the bumper falls off,] Uh-oh.
Squidward: What a hunk of junk.
SpongeBob: [His irises' light reflections turn into three hearts each.] More like a big hunk of gorgeous!
Squidward: We won't sell any patties from that old jalopy.
Mr. Krabs: You better sell a patty or you better not come back! [He bends Squidward and uses him as a crank to start the food truck. He then puts Squidward in the driver's seat.] Oh, and Mr. Squidward, you're driving.
[Squidward groans and SpongeBob slides into the truck through the window.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, I can navigate. [He holds up a small telescope to his eye.]
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh boy.
SpongeBob: Customers, ho.
Mr. Krabs: Get going!
[Bubble transition to the Krusty Kruiser driving through Bikini Bottom.]
SpongeBob: [His eye is looking through a telescope on the roof of the vehicle.] Now, all we need is a parking spot next to lots of hungry customers. Ooh! [It shows a group of four fish talking.] That looks like a good spot, Squidward. [They try parking there, but a truck carrying a vat of grease steals the spot.] Huh?
Squidward: That's my spot, you creep.
[The large vat of grease spills on the Krusty Kruiser, frying it as it drives away.]
SpongeBob: [looks out the window and points to another group of fish.] Ooh, try over there.
[The windshield wipers on the truck activate to clear the grease as it turns around and parks near the fish. Another food truck parks there, sending SpongeBob, Squidward, and their food truck flying into a building that it crashes into.]
SpongeBob: [inside one of the truck's storage compartments] Boink! I found an empty spot in here. [laughs]
Squidward: Shut it. [closes the compartment door.]
[Bubble transition to several construction worker fish working. The food truck drives by them.]
SpongeBob: Construction workers are always hungry. [The truck stops in front of the fish and SpongeBob pokes his head out the window.] Krabby Patties! Get your red-hot Krabby Patties! [He laughs and quickly makes a Krabby Patty. Another truck labeled ""Crane Crepes"" drives up with Incidental 39 driving it.]
Incidental 39: Hey, you claim jumpers! This is my turf. [He uses a large magnet on the top of the truck to grab the construction workers and move them to behind the food truck.] Bon appetite.
[Bubble transition to the next scene at Lady Upturn's mansion. Lady Upturn is standing in front of it.]
Squidward: Now this place looks classy.
SpongeBob: [His head is sticking out through the window.] Krabby Patties! Get your delicious, affordable Krabby Patties here!
Lady Upturn: Affordable? Oof, how common. Oh, canape truck!
[A large, white limousine pushes the food truck out of the way.]
SpongeBob and Squidward: Whoa! [The food truck drives into Bikini Bottom.]
Squidward: We tried all over Bikini Bottom and didn't sell a thing. Time to go back and tell Krabs we failed.
SpongeBob: There's one place we still haven't tried. [He unfolds his map, and it flies out the window.] Whoa! [The map wraps around the exterior of the truck and hits Squidward in the face.]
Squidward: Huh? [The map unfolds, revealing a map of Rock Bottom.]
SpongeBob: Rock Bottom. [Squidward groans and they pass by a sign reading ""You Are Now Leaving Bikini Bottom.""] Turn, turn!
[The food truck suddenly goes down a 90-degree angle steep road as SpongeBob and Squidward scream. By the time they land, they are in Rock Bottom. Howling can be heard.]
Squidward: Oh, this place is deserted.
SpongeBob: Hmm, if I recall correctly, there are always friendly Rock Bottomites at the bus stop. [The truck stops at the bus stop.]
Squidward: [sarcastically] What a fabulous idea, SpongeBob. There are so many customers here. [A tumbleweed passes by.]
SpongeBob: Maybe the Rock Bottom mall?
Squidward: [groans] The mall. [They drive into the Rock Bottom Mall, which appears deserted.]
SpongeBob: Where is everybody? [They drive out of the mall and into a circus] The circus should be good for crowds. [The circus is also deserted]
Squidward: Hmm. Maybe it's a flea circus? [Laughs]
SpongeBob: [He picks up a clown wig and puts it on] It's still warm. [They drive out of a circus and into a cemetery.] Oh, the cemetery is empty too. This place isn't even a ghost town.
Squidward: Well, we tried. Let's go home.
SpongeBob and Squidward: Huh?
[Incidental 211 appears blowing a raspberry.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] A customer. [They pull up to the fish] Step right up and get a delicious, half-fresh- [He stops and the fish fades away] Huh? Krabby Patty. [Incidental 211 is seen again blowing a raspberry, except he is farther away] Huh? There he is! [They drive toward the fish. Squidward's Kelpy G magazine lands on the windshield and Squidward throws it off.]
Squidward: [grunts] Where did he go?
SpongeBob: Up there. [Incidental 211 appears on top of a power line, blowing a raspberry.]
Squidward: [Angrily] I got him this time. [He drives up the power line and they get electrocuted. Incidental 211 jumps off.]
Bubble transition to the next scene, where Incidental 211 is flying on a hang glider with SpongeBob and Squidward following him. They crash into a rock and fall down as they scream. The truck then drives away with the fish flying away and blowing a raspberry.]
Squidward: Oh! We lost him.
SpongeBob: There he is! [The fish is on the back of the truck blowing a raspberry. He jumps off and fades away while spinning on a lamppost.]
SpongeBob and Squidward: [They run out of the truck] Huh?
Squidward: Can we go home now?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs said we can't go back until we sell at least one Krabby Patty.
Squidward: Fine, I'll just buy a stupid patty myself. [He reaches to his pocket, but there is nothing there] What? [His jeans are seen on his bed] Forgot my wallet in my pants at home. [Cuts back to SpongeBob and Squidward] Oh, SpongeBob, could you please lend me some money to buy a patty?
SpongeBob: I only carry Krusty Cash. [He gives Squidward the dollars, which read ""Not valid at the Krusty Krab.""]
Squidward: Not valid at the Krusty Krab? [He rips up the dollars] I guess if I ever want to go home, we have to sell a patty to that mysterious weirdo.
SpongeBob: No problem. [He puts on his glasses and pulls out a jellyfishing net] I'll track him down using my jellyfishing expertise.
[Bubble transition to the next scene, where Incidental 211 is walking by the bus station blowing a raspberry. SpongeBob and Squidward appear behind the station in the truck.]
SpongeBob: Hmm, hmm. [They drive away and find the fish. SpongeBob swings his net at the fish, but the fish disappears] Got ya! Huh? [A jellyfish flies out of the net and stings SpongeBob and Squidward as they scream.]
Squidward: Ow! My brainstem! [Bubble transition to the next scene, where Squidward is covering a hole with some seaweed.]
SpongeBob: I learned this trick reading Jungle Fish Comics. [SpongeBob and Squidward run back to the truck panting. Incidental 211 walks by and falls into the hole. SpongeBob and Squidward run back.]
Squidward: Ha! Got the little barnacle. [They look inside the hole and sees several jellyfish] Huh? [The jellyfish grab SpongeBob and Squidward and sting them as they scream. Incidental 211 walks by. Squidward tries to escape but he gets pulled back in]
[Bubble transition to the nest scene, where SpongeBob and Squidward are driving through Rock Bottom. They get to the bus stop and SpongeBob slides out of the window groaning. Squidward slides out from under the window groaning and they both sit on a bench.]
Squidward: Well, since I'm never going home, I may as well get comfortable.
Incidental 211: [Walks up to SpongeBob and Squidward and blows a raspberry] Hey! [Blows a raspberry] You're those weirdos that have been [blows a raspberry] chasing me around town. [blows a raspberry.]
Squidward: Why were you waving at us and then running away?
Incidental 211: Huh? [blows a raspberry] I can't [blows a raspberry] understand your accent. [blows a raspberry]
SpongeBob: I'll handle this, Squidward. I speak fluid Rock Bottom-ish. Why [blows a raspberry] were you [blows a raspberry] waving at us? [blows a raspberry]
Incidental 211: I wasn't [blows a raspberry] waving at you. [blows a raspberry] I was [blows a raspberry] drying out my armpits. [SpongeBob holds up a fresh Krabby Patty to him and he gasps. He smells it and becomes surprised.]
SpongeBob: We just wanted to [blows a raspberry] sell you a hot [blows a raspberry] delicious Krabby Patty. [blows a raspberry]
Incidental 211: It does look [blows a raspberry] tasty.
SpongeBob and Squidward: We're gonna sell a patty. [both blow raspberries. A large bus drives in and knocks away their food truck.] Huh?
[Several Rock Bottomites walk off the bus while blowing raspberries. They go into the Rock Bottom cemetery, jump into coffins, and close them. Several clowns also walk off the bus and enter the circus while blowing raspberries. They walk into a small clown car which then drives away.]
Incidental 222: [walks off the bus] Hey, Bert. [blows a raspberry] Too bad you couldn't [blows a raspberry] come with us on our yearly trip to the [blows a raspberry] Krusty Krab, [blows a raspberry] but here's your Krabby Patty. [He blows a raspberry and hands a Krabby Patty to Incidental 211]
Incidental 211: Thanks, Frank. [blows a raspberry] But you know how long these pits take to dry. [blows a raspberry] Sorry, fellas. [blows a raspberry] I'd love to buy a patty from ya, but I already have a whole bag. [He eats the patty. SpongeBob and Squidward groan and melt.]
[Bubble transition to the next scene, where Mr. Krabs is behind the Krusty Krab carrying a wheelbarrow of money.]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Those Rock Bottomers really love their Krabby Patty. [he sees the damaged food truck coming back] Ooh. [SpongeBob and Squidward tiredly walk out of the truck groaning.] SpongeBob, Squidward, you're back. How many patties did you sell?
SpongeBob: Uh, none.
Mr. Krabs: What in the name of all that's greasy have you been doing all day? You're going right back out there until you sell a patty! [His stomach growls] Sorry, boys. I'm a little hangry. I've been so busy, I haven't eaten anything myself. [Squidward holds up a Krabby Patty to Mr. Krabs. He tries biting into it, but Squidward swipes it away.]
Squidward: Ahem, that'll be [blows a raspberry] five bucks. [blows a raspberry]
Mr. Krabs: Alright, fine. [He hands Squidward five dollars] Comes back straight to me pocket anyhow.
SpongeBob: Yay, we finally sold a Krabby Patty!
Squidward: I can finally go home!
Mr. Krabs: [Laughs and takes a bite out of the patty, but then groans.] When I have to pay for it, it tastes like old snail litter. [He throws the patty at the food truck] Uh-oh. [The food truck collapses on him] Oh. [blows a raspberry, ending the episode.]",0.38,Luke Brookshier

Bubble Bass wakes up and declares his intent to get the Pigulon action figure to complete his collection. He dresses up in a Wolfman costume and goes to the Toy Barrel to try to obtain it, but the store is sold out of Pigulon figures. Bubble Bass notices that SpongeBob and Patrick bought the last Pigulon figure. Patrick rips open the package and uses the figure as a scratcher. Bubble Bass tries to obtain the figure from them, and SpongeBob agrees to give it to him at first, but soon rejects his offer after mentioning that he and Patrick bought it together.While Karen continues narrating, Bubble Bass pushes her out of the scene. He later shows up at SpongeBob's house disguised as a toy inspector in an attempt to take back the Pigulon figure. SpongeBob lets Bubble Bass into his house and opens his hidden vault where he keeps his toys. SpongeBob and Patrick show the toys to Bubble Bass, continually asking him if any of their toys seem dangerous to him. Although several toys harm Bubble Bass, he throws them away, declaring them not to be dangerous. SpongeBob finally shows him the Pigulon figure, but instead gives him the Perilous Percival figure as he went out of order. The fuses on the toy result in Bubble Bass flying out of the house.Bubble Bass goes back to SpongeBob's house, now portraying as a ghost hunter in an attempt to scan the house. He comes across the Pigulon figure, saying it contains spirits inside. He attempts to take the figure, but SpongeBob and Patrick say that they will make the figure vanish in their home. They call out a spell that results in a demon appearing, and Bubble Bass is taken in with him, as the Pigulon figure remains in SpongeBob's home.Bubble Bass goes back again, asking SpongeBob and Patrick straightforward to hand over the figure. He drinks Fizz Bomb Cola to let out a burp on SpongeBob's house, destroying it in the process. SpongeBob and Patrick run to Patrick's house. After Patrick rejects Bubble Bass again, Bubble Bass uses more Fizz Bomb fuel and Volcano Sauce to destroy his house. SpongeBob and Patrick proceed to go inside Squidward's house. Angered, Squidward kicks Bubble Bass out, to which Bubble Bass proceeds to chug Fizz Bomb Cola from a truck and attempt to belch Squidward's house away. However, Squidward's house does not move, to which Squidward declares his house was ""SpongeBob-proofed.""Karen continues to narrate the story, in which Bubble Bass gets the help of his mother. They show up at Squidward's house, to which Bubble Bass gives the Fizz Bomb fuel to his mother, but she says that she does not need it. She inhales a belch which destroys Squidward's house, as well as the water on the surface. Mama Bass tells SpongeBob and Patrick to hand over the figure. SpongeBob gives her the receipt, which makes Mama Bass angry. She inhales another belch which burps away Bubble Bass's clothes, leaving him in his underwear. Bubble Bass cries, but SpongeBob and Patrick give him the Pigulon figure, which is now broken. Karen concludes the narration with Bubble Bass having put the figure on his shelf and Squidward having to rebuild his house himself, mentioning how Squidward's insurance doesn't cover ""Belch Damage"". Squidward, enraged, blames Karen and her story for his house being destroyed. He chases after a now frightened Karen, although she disappears inside the storybook, much to Squidward's confusion, as the episode ends.",The Big Bad Bubble Bass,"[The episode starts with a brown book with the letters BBB.]
Karen: [drops on-screen on a rope] I'm Karen, the blue fairy, and this tale lacks class, for it's the story of... [opens the book] The Big Bad Bubble Bass. [flips a page to a picture of Bubble Bass sleeping. The scene fades to the beginning of the book with Bubble Bass sleeping. His Mermaid Man alarm clock rings to mark the top of the morning hour]
Alarm clock: Evil! Evil! [Bubble Bass hits it and gets sucked into the couch and then comes out off it]
Bubble Bass: Hurrapturous day! [zooms to his shelves] Today my collection will be completed! At long last, [holds a flyer of Pigulon] Pigulon, leader of the Swine Force 3 action team will be mine! [tosses some of his clothes] And I know just what to wear. Behold Wolfman Boy, mortal enemy of the Swine Force 3. [tries to put the Wolfman Boy costume on but has difficulties putting it on and then falls over]
[Bubble transition to Bubble Bass walking to the Toy Barrel, struggling to put on the costume.]
Karen: Hours later, as the story goes, Bubble Bass arrived, still adjusting his clothes.
Bubble Bass: [runs to a Pigulon flyer on the entrance but the clerk puts a sold out note on it] Sold out? [the clerk puts a sorry note on it] Sorry? [the clerk puts a ""Eh. Not really"" note on it] Not really?! Oh, this can't be happening! Without Pigulon, my life is over! [starts crying]
SpongeBob: [exiting the Toy Barrel store with Patrick] Oh boy, Patrick! I can't believe we got the very last Pigulon!
Patrick: Yeah! Let's play with him! [takes him out of the bag and bites off the top packaging. He swallows it.]
Bubble Bass: Not Pigulon's precious packaging! There goes half his value!
Patrick: Hm. [scratches his butt with Pigulon and laughs] It's a good scratcher! [cut to Bubble Bass face palming his face]
Bubble Bass: There goes the other half. This cannot stand! I must liberate Pigulon from the clutches of those buffoons. [marches angrily towards them and moves SpongeBob aside] Pardon me, good sirs. I couldn't help but notice your Pigulon action figure. Might I buy, trade, or swindle it from you?
SpongeBob: [Patrick hands him it] Oh, he's all yours, Bubble Bass. Anything for a friend.
[Bubble Bass squeals and tries to take it, but Patrick takes it back.]
Patrick: Hey, wait! I wanna play with the pig man! He's mine too!
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, I forgot! Patrick and I both chipped in to buy Pigulon. Well, see ya later! [they are seen throwing and catching Pigulon]
Bubble Bass: [rainclouds around him] By the gods of Nerddom, I will acquire that Pigulon, no matter what!
Karen: [rainclouds flick away] So Bubble Bass plotted, his courage he found, as he ranted and raved with no one around!
Bubble Bass: [pushes Karen] Be gone, vile machine! I have a toy to rescue! [bubble wipe to the next scene with Bubble Bass ringing SpongeBob's doorbell]
SpongeBob: [opens the door] Oh, hello, mysterious stranger! How may I help you? [Gets hit in the mouth with a wallet]
Bubble Bass: The toy inspector. I'll have to take any dangerous toys found on your premises back to the station for questioning.
SpongeBob: Dangerous toys? [gasps until his hands goes inside his mouth] You gotta come in right away!
Bubble Bass: Yes, now where do you keep your meager allotment of playthings?
SpongeBob: Oh, over here in the vault.
Bubble Bass: The vault?
SpongeBob: [enters a passcode, puts his tongue on the scanner, security takes one of his eyelashes, and he plays the ending to the theme song with his nose. The vault opens, and provides mini stairs. Bubble Bass peeks inside then SpongeBob pushes him. He and Patrick enter it] Let's start, shall we? We've got a lot of toys to get through. Luckily, I've alphabetized them. This is Aaron Aardvark. Is he dangerous?
Bubble Bass: [touches one of its ears with his thumb] Ow! [tosses it] Uh, no. [sucks his thumb]
Patrick: This is Abby Aardvark. Is she dangerous?
Bubble Bass: [stares at the figure and its head launches at him] Ouch! [tosses it] No.
SpongeBob: This is Albert Aardvark. Is he dangerous?
Bubble Bass: No. It's fine. [tosses it away from SpongeBob's hand. It explodes]
French Narrator: Many, many toys later...
SpongeBob: And on to the P's. Porktastic Pigulon. Is he dangerous?
Bubble Bass: Ooh! Yes, he's very dang-
SpongeBob: Oops, I went out of order. This is Perilous Perciful. Is he dangerous? [hands it to him]
Bubble Bass: Uh... [the action figure launches him out of the house and explodes into fireworks]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooh! [bubble wipe to the next scene with Bubble Bass ringing SpongeBob's doorbell. They answer the door]
Bubble Bass: Yes, hello. I'm a world famous ghost hunter, and I've detected a massive haunting within your domicile. I'll have to scan your home to pinpoint possessed item. Mhm! Lots of ghost activity.
SpongeBob: There is?
Bubble Bass: Yes. [imitating the scanner] Beep, beep, beep. [gasps, then SpongeBob and Patrick gasp. He beeps multiple times until he reaches the Pigulon action figure] This is it! This item contains a malevolent spirit!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh no, not Pigulon!
Bubble Bass: I'll have to take him back to the lab for spectral containment.
Patrick: [chuckles] No need.
SpongeBob: Yeah, we'll banish that ghost for ya right here! [they chant a phrase which rises the figure and a demon comes out of it. Bubble Bass drops his jaw to the ground]
Pigulon demon: Who dares bother me from my sleep?
Patrick: [points to Bubble Bass] He started it. [the demon roars and grabs Bubble Bass. Pigulon falls]
SpongeBob: [catches Pigulon] Yay! Pigulon is saved! [bubble wipe to the next scene]
Bubble Bass: [walking to SpongeBob's house with ectoplasm all over him. He wipes it off and bangs on the door] ScumBob! Puketrick! You blithering fools better hand over Pigulon, or I'll chug, and I'll glug, and I'll belch your house down! [growls]
Patrick: [as Pigulon, through SpongeBob's house] Nobody's home!
Bubble Bass: Hm? [growls while steams mad, then takes out a bottle of Fizz Bomb Cola] Time for some Fizz Bomb burp fuel. [drinks it, and his stomach boils. He inhales deeply, making chest balloon upwards then burps down SpongeBob's house. Gary falls on SpongeBob, and they run to Patrick's rock]
Bubble Bass: I said hand over Pigulon, or I'll chug, and I'll glug, and I'll belch your house down... again!
Patrick: [his lips are through the rock] Good luck. I built this rock entirely out of rock. [blows a raspberry]
Bubble Bass: [growls, then pulls out another bottle of Fizz Bomb Cola and a bottle of hot sauce] Let's turn up the heat. [drinks both, and his stomach boils. He burps down Patrick's rock]
Patrick: They just don't make rocks the way they used to. [they run to Squidward's house. They bang on his door constantly saying his name]
Squidward: Not interested. [SpongeBob steps on his head and goes up the house's nose. Patrick does the same. They crash downstairs] Hey, what part of ""not interested"" don't you understand? [Bubble Bass taps him, then pushes him out of the way]
Bubble Bass: Pardon me Squidward, I'm going to need that Pigulon doll within your residence.
Squidward: [growls in frustration] I said not interested! [slaps him outside]
Bubble Bass: Then I'll chug, and I'll glug, and I'll belch your house down too! [signals a Fizz Bomb Cola truck to come his way. He grabs the hose and chugs the entire truck down. He tries to burp down Squidward's house but nothing happens] Huh? [burps to his house again but nothing happens] Huh? [burps again] I don't understand! Those burps should've rendered his home into stinky vapors!
Squidward: Sorry, Bubble Bass. I just had my house SpongeBob-proofed. [laughs. SpongeBob laughs along with. Squidward stops. Bubble Bass steams]
Karen: With his belching now foiled, he had but one plan. Run home to his mommy, and cry like a big man. He wept like a fountain and lied to the ma'am: ""Those boys were the bullies,"" and he her sweet lamb. Her mother was livid: She screamed and she spat. ""No villain should take his son's toy like that!""
[The scene fades into the neighborhood with Bubble Bass crying, while his mother drives him.]
Mama Bass: I am so disappointed. You should be belching at a 10th grade level by now! Let mama show you how it's done.
Bubble Bass: [hands her a bottle of Fizz Bomb Cola] Here, mother. [his mom smacks it away]
Mama Bass: Oh, I don't need that stuff! [inhales deeply, causing her body to balloon up massively and belches down Squidward's house so hard to the point where the Bikini Atoll ocean is wiped out. She walks to SpongeBob and Patrick] You boys had better give Bubble Bass his toy back!
Patrick: B-But it's our toy...
SpongeBob: I have the receipt! [she takes it and reads it]
Mama Bass: Bubble Bass!
Bubble Bass: M-M-Mama, t-t-t-that receipt must be a forgery! [she inhales deeply] No, mama, please! I was just trying to- [she burps on him. Bubble Bass is shown in his underwear, and he shrieks and covers himself as his mom walks away. He starts crying]
SpongeBob: Hey, hey, don't cry. We have something that might cheer you up.
Bubble Bass: You do?
SpongeBob: Patrick and I want you to have Pigulon.
Bubble Bass: [yelps happily] Oh, joy! Gimme, gimme, gimme!
Patrick: Ha, here you go! [it is completely destroyed] I know you'll love him. We sure had fun playing with him.
[Bubble Bass cries like a waterfall.]
Karen: Well, Bubble Bass won, so he told himself, as he ran home to put his new toy on the shelf. Squidward was forced to rebuild alone. His insurance won't cover belch damage to home. [Squidward growls]
Squidward: Hey! Your fairy tale did this! Get outta here!
Karen: Gah! Farewell, until next story time! [she files into the book which closes on her. The book ascends]

He notices a substance that he thinks is goo show up underneath Mr. Krabs when he walks in and he sprays him with water. SpongeBob notices more of that substance outside the Krusty Krab and uses soap to clean it up. One of the soap bubbles mixes with a solution Plankton is making, and it creates an explosion. Plankton thinks the substance on the ground is oil and tries to use it for money. Mr. Krabs and Plankton fight over it, before Karen tells them that the combination of Krabby Patty grease and chum runoff resulted in grease being leaked into the ground for decades. She tells them that the grease's viscosity index and flavoring can be used for a profit, though it's evenly split between the restaurants in which Mr. Krabs and Plankton agree to work as partners.After several days, Mr. Krabs and Plankton fight over how they can use the grease, before SpongeBob tells them that he uses the grease in many different ways and tells them that they can sell it for everything. Mr. Krabs and Plankton form a business selling Dr. Krabton's Miracle Everything Juice, to sell the grease for any way that they can use it. Several Bikini Bottomites drive towards the stand and crash into each other, to which Mr. Krabs and Plankton start to sell Everything Juice, using it for calming babies, gluing hair back to heads and fixing a boat. Mr. Krabs and Plankton quickly gain a fortune as a result.Mr. Krabs heads to sell some Everything Juice to Mrs. Puff at Boating School, with SpongeBob's assistance. SpongeBob uses it to fuel her boats and clean her lighthouse, as well as smoothing out his face. Mrs. Puff agrees to purchase ten bottles. Plankton heads to sell some Everything Juice to Sandy at her treedome. Plankton advertises the product by saying it can fertilize lawns, polish the treedome glass, and shine nuts. Sandy claims to not believe in miracles at first, but after Plankton claims that Everything Juice can also keep Sandy's oxygen machine running, she agrees to buy a case.To further endorse Everything Juice, Mr. Krabs and Plankton perform a song to the Bikini Bottomites, showing them the other uses that Everything Juice has. Mr. Krabs and Plankton manage to successfully sell it to the Bikini Bottomites. In an office building, Mr. Krabs and Plankton discuss their fortune and friendship, and have a money fight, but the Bikini Bottomites angrily barge in, showing the side-effects that resulted, such as affecting Sandy's air and giving Mrs. Puff pinkeye. They demand for refunds and destroy the office building, as Mr. Krabs and Plankton argue over who is at fault.Outside the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob tries to obtain more grease from a machine, but it is all out. Mr. Krabs and Plankton meanwhile still argue over who is at fault for the side-effects. They address to each other that their friendship is over as they both head back to their restaurants. Right as they do, both the Krusty Krab and the Chum Bucket sink underground, as a result of them using all of their grease from their respective restaurants. Mr. Krabs and Plankton continue to argue, although SpongeBob exclaims that he is glad that the three of them are together, as the episode ends.",There Will Be Grease,"[The episode begins with Mr. Krabs walking to the Krusty Krab, whistling. He enters and sees SpongeBob cleaning up.]
Mr. Krabs: Nice work, boy-o. She looks cleaner than a freshly scraped hull.
SpongeBob: Oh, hello, Mr. Krabs, I... [drops the mop and screams] Your feet! [points to his feet]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm? [looks at his feet and gets sprayed out by a hose]
SpongeBob: [holding a fire hose and wearing a fireman hat] Phew! That was close! You almost tracked goo all over your nice clean restaurant!
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. Good thing. Heh. [falls over]
SpongeBob: [notices a grease trail] Hmm... [follows the trail] Oh, looks like this puddle here is the culprit! Don't worry, Mr. K! I'll have her cleaned up in no time! Hmm... ah-ha! [grabs a gallon of soap and pours it on his head, pulls his tie and his head starts spinning like a motor. He jumps and cleans the grease with his head]
Plankton: [pouring a chemical into a beaker] Okay, you just pour this in here and... [a bubble lands on the chemical and explodes] [to Karen] ""It's a beautiful day,"" you said. ""Why not do some evil science outside?"", you said. SpongeBob! What in Neptune's navel are you doing?
SpongeBob: [comes on-screen and head stops spinning, exposing his brain] Oh. Sorry, Plankton. I was just cleaning up this goo puddle for Mr. Krabs.
Plankton: [looks at grease puddle] That doesn't look like goo. It looks like oil! Holy moly, Karen! We're sittin' on a mountain of moolah!
Mr. Krabs: [dives on-screen] That oil's mine , you hear? [grabs SpongeBob] My employee found it, and besides, [throws SpongeBob away and drags the grease on his side] it's on me property.
Plankton: Not so fast, Krabs! [drags it on his side] That's my oil! And it's on my property! [Mr. Krabs grabs the grease, but Plankton pulls it back. They pull it and get launched back. They briefly death-stare at each other, then they start fighting.]
Karen: [analyzes the grease] Mmm! Actually, you're both wrong. It's not oil at all.
Mr. Krabs and Plankton: [they stop fighting, Krabs being bashed over the head by Plankton's club] It's not?
Karen: According to my analysis, it's a combination of [Krabby Patty appears on her screen] Krabby Patty grease and [chum appears on her screen] chum runoff, [shows a visual of goo accumulating under the two restaurants] which your two restaurants has been leaking in the ground for decades.
Plankton: So it's just worthless old grease?
Karen: I wouldn't call it worthless. [her screen shows a line graph rising] It has a high viscosity index [her screen shows a mouth licking its lips] and impressive flavor imparting characteristics.
Mr. Krabs: So... it's worth-full?
Karen: Yes. However, the deposit appears to be evenly split between your restaurants. [zooms out to show it between the restaurant]
Mr. Krabs: Well, Plankton, looks like if we want to make a lot of money..
Plankton: ...we'll have to do it as...
Mr. Krabs and Plankton: [they realize something] ...partners. [the word ""PARTNERS"" falls on them]
French Narrator: [narrating time card] Several long days later...
[Krabs is sitting in a lawn chair next to the grease puddle, as Plankton paces back and forth.]
Plankton: Come on, Krabs, there's gotta be some use of this stuff we can agree on! [has an idea] Let's sell it to the military! Imagine... [imagines a flame thrower] fuel for flame throwers, [images a robot being oiled by a helicopter] lubricant for killer robots, [imagines a group of soldiers that smell a bomb, are distracted, and explode] bombs that smell like french fries! [chuckles]
Mr. Krabs: We'll use it to boost business at the Krusty Krab: [imagines grease being poured from a pump onto an open Krabby Patty] A flavorful new sandwich topping, [imagines a grease milkshake as a cow moos] a savory new milkshake, [three customers smell a grease-scented toilet] and a lovely new scent for the restrooms!
Plankton: [blows the thought bubble away with a flamethrower] Oh no! We're not using my grease to drive customers to your restaurant! [Mr. Krabs starts growling at him] Why I oughta!
Mr. Krabs: Why, you! [they start fighting]
SpongeBob: [uses a saucer to pour grease into a bucket] Oh, gosh! I don't see why you need to find just one use for this stuff. I started using it for everything !
[Mr. Krabs and Plankton stop fighting, with Krabs about to hit Plankton with a wrench and Plankton wielding a club.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
Plankton: Wha?
SpongeBob: [he is shown brushing his teeth with grease] Toothpaste, [wipes himself with a towel in the shower] body wash, [puts grease deodorant under his armpit] deodorant, [polishes his shoes with grease] shoe polish, [puts the grease on his face] all night face mask, [Gary licks the grease out of a bowl] Gary's breakfast, [SpongeBob licks the grease from a bowl labeled ""My Own""] my own breakfast! [puts grease on a bump on his leg, making the swelling go down] It even cured my bursitis! What I mean is, if you can use it for anything, why not sell it for everything ? [Mr. Krabs and Plankton's eyes turn into money signs]
[They have set up a stand selling it as SpongeBob pumps it from the ground.]
Mr. Krabs: [reading along with his finger] Dr. Krabton's Miracle Everything Juice. Not bad.
Plankton: But we better get some customers here, Eugene. I was up all night painting that sign.
Mr. Krabs: Have a little faith, Plankton. [gasps] Behold! The lunch rush! [A fish is driving and sees the stand. He and his phone start screaming and he stops his boat.]
Fish: Wow! [other fish crash into him and a bus crashes as well, creating a dust cloud. The dust cloud clears, revealing that tons of cars crashed.]
Mr. Krabs: Wee-hee! Time to get to work! [grabs bottle, he and Plankton go to the crash site]
[Three triplet babies are crying. A mother fish rips her hair out from stress.]
Plankton: Pardon me, ma'am, but how about some Dr. Krabton's Miracle Everything Juice to quiet the little angels?
[He puts the bottles in the babies' mouths, calming them down. Mr. Krabs pours grease on the woman's head and sticks her hair back on, and she smiles. Mr. Krabs runs up to a fish in a boat with a dented front.]
Fish #2: [groans]
Mr. Krabs: Why, Dr. Krabton can fix up your boat for you! [smashes it against the boat to straighten it out] See? There you go. Good as new.
Fish #2: Say, it really woiks! Three cheers for Everything Juice!
Fish in accident: Huraaay! [jump out and run to the stand with money]
Woman fish: We'll take one!
[They all buy their Everything Juice and run away, leaving a giant pile of money on the stand. Krabs' and Plankton's heads come out.]
Plankton: Look at all this cash, Krabs! We're rich!
Mr. Krabs: Not rich enough. We got to take our show on the road!
[A bottle of Everything Juice transitions to them driving a boat up to Mrs. Puff's Boating School.]
Mr. Krabs: All right, Plankton. Let a real salesman show you how it's done. [rings doorbell]
Mrs. Puff: [opens door] Eugene? What a surprise. Uh, we don't have a lunch date today, do we?
Mr. Krabs: Not with me. Your date today is with [motions with arms] value! Suppose I told you there was one product that could fuel all your boats... [turns SpongeBob into a condiment dispenser and launches grease on the boat engines, which spin rapidly] Reinvigorate old lighthouse paint jobs... [SpongeBob grabs a paint roller with grease and cleans the lighthouse, making it sparkle]
SpongeBob: Ooh!
Mr. Krabs: And even cover up those... [clears throat] maturation lines around your eyes.
[SpongeBob takes out a trowel with grease on it and puts it on his face, wiping it clean.]
Mrs. Puff: How dare you? [slaps him, then takes out money] Give me ten bottles.
[An Everything Juice bottle transitions to SpongeBob, Krabs, and Plankton walking up to Sandy's treedome.]
Plankton: You did pretty good back there, Krabs. But now it's time to watch a master!
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, gladly. [Plankton rings the doorbell] Let me know when he gets here. [laughs]
Sandy: [opens door] Howdy.
Plankton: Greetings, Sandra. I am here to tell you about our latest invention. It'll fertilize your lawn. [throws grease to SpongeBob, who pours it on his head and grass grows] Polish your dome glass... [SpongeBob polishes the glass with a cleaning cloth and the grease. A clam flies into the glass and gets dizzy.] And give even your oldest nuts that fresh-picked shine! [snickers. SpongeBob pours grease on a live-action acorn to make it bigger, and it crushes Plankton.] It's Dr. Krabton's Miracle Everything Juice! [SpongeBob, Krabs, and Plankton motion to it, and confetti fanfare blasts]
Sandy: [unimpressed] I ain't some hayseed, Plankton. I'm a scientist. I don't believe in miracles.
Plankton: [he, Krabs, and SpongeBob are frowning] Well, but it can also keep oxygen machines running in top shape! [they smile again]
Sandy: Huh...
[Pan to an unstable machine inside Sandy's dome, smoking and sputtering.]
Sandy: [nervously] Well, I do like breathin'. [takes out money] I'll take a whole case!
[An Everything Juice bottle transitions to Krabs, Plankton, SpongeBob, and their truck outside at dusk.]
Mr. Krabs: This door-to-door stuff's taking too long. [smacks fist] We got to go big!
Plankton: How big?
Mr. Krabs: Musical big!
[He elbows the truck and its headlights turn on. It collapses into a platform with an organ and an Everything Juice banner coming out of it. Krabs and Plankton spin around and are in tuxedos. They dance as the organ starts playing, and a crowd appears around them. Krabs goes up to a trucker and starts dancing.]

[The money falls down the screen and transitions to an office building labeled Dr. Krabton's. Jellyfish swim by, holding bottles. Inside, Krabs counts his money, and Plankton sits on a chair made of money.]
Mr. Krabs: [counting money] A million one, a million two, a million three...
Plankton: Eugene, is this what friendship feels like?
Mr. Krabs: Perhaps it is, Sheldon. Perhaps it is. [pauses, they look at each other]
Krabs and Plankton: Money fight! [they throw money at each other, elevator dings]
Plankton: Huh?
[A horde of angry customers come in through the elevator, yelling.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey! What are you all doing in here?

[Krabs is about to give her some when Sandy slaps her and pulls her out of the way.]
Sandy: No more! You two have ruined the whole town!
Crowd: We want our [raises weapons] money back!
[Mr. Krabs and Plankton are cornered. Plankton nervously throws away a stack of money. The crowd begin smashing the building and setting fire to the money.]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] I knew you would mess this up. You always mess things up.
Plankton: Me? I'm not the one who came up with that lousy song!
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob pumping grease outside the Krusty Krab and Chum Bucket.]
SpongeBob: [grunting, pump wheezes] Must be running low on grease.
Mr. Krabs: [walks in with Plankton] Oh, well, it wasn't me who sold it as fire extinguisher recharging fluid.
Plankton: All right, all right. But I'm not the one who sold it as acne treatment to high schoolers.
Mr. Krabs: [walks away, arm raised] Oh, but you did market it as drinkable vitamins!
Plankton: [standing in Chum Bucket doorway] That's it! This friendship is over ! We are mortal enemies once more!
Mr. Krabs: Fine by [points to self] me! [points to Plankton] I don't want to see you ever again, ever !
[They slam the doors of the restaurants closed. An empty cavern appears under the restaurants. It caves in, and SpongeBob falls.]
SpongeBob: Whoa, whoa! Yaaah!
[The Krusty Krab and Chum Bucket fall into the hole. Mr. Krabs and Plankton are buried under the rubble.]
Mr. Krabs: This is all your fault!

It lands on a planet and someone in a spacesuit exits the rocket. It is revealed to be SpongeBob as he plants a flag with a Krabby Patty on it. It turns out that it was just a dream. He then wakes up to hear some noise in his house, so he thinks that he has intruders. He and Gary then go downstairs, and SpongeBob opens the door so Gary can scare away the intruders. It turns out to be SpongeBob's friend from Kamp Koral, Narlene Narwhal, whom he has not seen since he was a kid.SpongeBob and Narlene hug as they look back at a memory of them at camp. Nobby is riding a sea bear as it is chasing SpongeBob and Narlene, who are holding sausages. Back in the present, Narlene sees how much SpongeBob has grown since they were kids. Narlene came to visit SpongeBob because of a promise that she could always come to him if she were ever in Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob is sad that her brother Nobby is not with her, but soon thereafter, he shows up from the kitchen, holding his fridge. Nobby grabs SpongeBob and gives him a hug. Nobby had gotten a lot bigger since they were kids. Nobby is then hungry, so SpongeBob lets him take what he desired from the fridge. He proceeds to devour the entire fridge as SpongeBob reminisces about the memories at camp. Nobby's sea mule shows up and starts to eat a part of SpongeBob's head.The next morning, the sea mule brays on top of SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob wakes up, pets Gary, then goes into the bathroom to get ready for the day. He covers his eyes and shrieks as he sees Narlene in his toilet. Narlene thinks it is a whirlpool bathtub and joyfully spins around in it. SpongeBob tries to hand her a scrub brush; however, she grabs SpongeBob instead. Patrick is outside the bathroom wrapped in a towel waiting to get in. Afterwards, Nobby cooks' pancakes for breakfast and flings copious amounts to SpongeBob, Narlene, and Gary.Narlene, Nobby, and SpongeBob sit on chairs outside of SpongeBob's house. Narlene uses a knife to shave a wood log into a toothpick. She then passes the knife to Nobby, who shaves a wood log into a turkey. SpongeBob is handed the knife and ends up shaving himself into a banjo. He joyfully jumps out of his chair and moves toward Squidward, who runs away screaming.SpongeBob's house is rebuilt out of wood and medal scraps, which Narlene considers to be ""hillified."" SpongeBob is thrilled as Hans changes his outfit and Narlene's cousin WillyBob shows up at the front door. SpongeBob and WillyBob are introduced to each other. WillyBob starts wrestling with Nobby until Narlene shows up and joins the fray. A large band of narwhals storm the house and make sweeping changes. They also set up camp outdoors and extend onto Squidward's property. Squidward has trouble sleeping until he ultimately decides to move out. When he walks outside, Patrick grabs him and starts to square dance.A news report brings breaking news of narwhals ravaging Bikini Bottom. Citizens are warned to lay low to avoid any further complications. The reporter is turned into a hillbilly as the broadcast is cut off. SpongeBob tries to get what he thinks is Narlene's kin to leave. However, Narlene and Nobby reveal WillyBob is their only other relative and come to the realization that they are not even real narwhals, they are actually nearwhals. With SpongeBob's suggestion, they go to Plankton for help. He agrees to contact his family as they had been feuding with the nearwhals for many years. His family swiftly reacts at hearing the word ""nearwhals."" They come out of the phone and storm out of the Chum Bucket ready to drive the nearwhals out of Bikini Bottom. They fight the nearwhals in various locations throughout the town and are successful in their mission.Nobby packs many of SpongeBob's belongings into the wagon. SpongeBob, Narlene, and SpongeBob say their final goodbyes as Narlene promises to visit again soon. Nobby pulls the wagon to Squidward's house, where him and Nobby enter. Narlene thinks Squidward welcomed her to his house anytime, which he instantly denies. The sea mule shakes Squidward's house as the episode ends.",Something Narwhal This Way Comes,"[The episode starts with a rocket zipping through space, and then lands on a planet, with a person on it. It's revealed that it was SpongeBob as he comes out of the suit while he has has a flag and plants it.]

SpongeBob: Hill-ified? Why, I'm... [Hans changes his outfit] thrill-ified! Yee-how! [WillyBob knocks on the door]
WillyBob: Howdy! Is Narlene here?
Narlene: It's cousin WillyBob! [She and WillyBob play with their noses] WillyBob, meet SpongeBob. Hey, SpongeBob, meet WillyBob! [chuckles]
SpongeBob: Well, any cousin of Narlene is a cousin of mine, WillyBob! [he and WillyBob spit into their foot and shakes foots with it]
WillyBob: Well, much obliged, cousin Bob! Come on, Nobby! Let's wrestle! [he and Nobby are wrestling until Narlene comes in]
SpongeBob: Hey, cousins! Save some for me! [wipes mouth off, then growls until someone knocks on the door] Huh? [opens door]
Nearwhal: Is Narlene here?
SpongeBob: Welcome, welcome! Any cousin of Narlene is a- [someone knocks on the door] Huh. [opens the door to get pushed by many nearwhals. They start throwing SpongeBob's stuff away. Nearwhals hang up clothes. Transition to night]
Squidward: [trying to sleep until he moves out]
Patrick: Hey, cousin SquidBob! Let's square-dance! [brings him to SpongeBob's house] [A Breaking News sign is on screen]
Fish announcer: Breaking news! Bikini Bottom is under siege from narwhals! Toothless hoards of backwards hillfolk are plaguing citizens with jung-band music, hog-calling, and bad grammar! Citizens are advised to stay indoors, and to avoid stomping your foot to the countrified beat! Ahh! [nearwhals turn the fish announcer into a hillbilly] They's here! Save yerselves! Ahhh!
SpongeBob: Yikes! I-I think maybe it's time to ask your kin to leave, Narlene.
Narlene: They're not my kin! I thought they's was your kin! WillyBob is our only relation.
Nobby: [speaking gibberish] Nearwhal!
Narlene: [scratches her head with her foot] Nobby's right! The rest of them ain't even narwhals! [Nobby grabs a nearwhal and Narlene grabs the fake nose with her foot] They're nearwhals! Phony little varmit! [the narwhal falls over] Kin or no kin, we gotta hogtie this hoedown!
SpongeBob: Well, the good news is, I think I know someone who can help us.
Nobby: [cheering and speaks gibberish]
Narlene: What's the bad news?
Plankton: [thunderclap] Sure! I can get rid of those nearwhal nimrods for ya. [chuckles] Their stupid family has being feuding with my stupid family for years!
Narlene: Oh, I've seen it. Them Plankton sure know how to hold a grudge! [Her, Nobby, and Plankton agree]
Plankton: Ah! [pulls up an old phone and spins the handle] [The next scene shows Clem sleeping next to the phone ringing until he wakes up scared and answers the phone.]
Clem: How do?
Plankton: [terrified yelling] Nearwhals!
Plankton's cousins: Nearwhals? Nearwhals? Nearwhals? Feud!
Plankton: Voilà! Hm, huh? [Plankton's cousins come out of the phone and walk on him] [SpongeBob, Narlene and Nobby hide behind a rock]
Plankton's cousins: Get them nearwhals!
Nearwhal: [dancing until he sees the plankton] Huh? [Plankton jumps and start biting them]
Ma Angler (Plankton): Consagrn nearwhals! [plankton start biting the nearwhal] Give 'em the itch, plankton! [they start biting the nearwhals]
Nearwhal: [The plankton start biting the nearwhals and start scratching themselves] It's a plankton sneak attack. Nearwhals, retreat! [They call the horn. The plankton chase the nearwhals out of town.]
SpongeBob, Narlene, and Nobby: [cheering]
Plankton: [bowing down] Thank you.
SpongeBob, Narlene, and Nobby: [Clapping] Yeah!
Narlene: I think someone deserves a little kiss!
Plankton: Oh! [puckers lips] [SpongeBob kisses him on the head] Ew!
SpongeBob: [wiggling toes] Thank yee, cousin Plankee! [touches his cheeks with his toe and Plankton walks away. Bubble wipe to the next scene with Nobby packing away with SpongeBob's stuff.]
Nobby: Y'all take care now! [chuckles]
SpongeBob: I already miss you guys! Will you come back and visit us real soon?
Narlene: [pats SpongeBob with her foot] Sooner than you think! Ye-yah! [Nobby starts moving the wagon]
SpongeBob: [Chuckles, then waves goodbye with a tissue] Aww.

Squidward: What the?

SpongeBob has a gift for him. When Santa comes into his house, he has to shrink himself to fit inside. While he is putting the presents by the Christmas tree, he accidentally kicks his gift under the sofa without realizing it. Seven months later, while SpongeBob is vacuuming his house, he notices that Santa never got the gift. SpongeBob is upset that the gift is 212 days late and tells Patrick about it. They decide to travel to the North Pole. While they are skipping and hopping, they accidentally step on Plankton. They tell Plankton that they are going to the North Pole. Plankton pitches an idea to go to the North Pole to hack into Santa's computer to put his name on the nice list. He wants to do it so Santa will give him Krabby Patty secret formula. He decides to tag along with SpongeBob and Patrick. They travel in Plankton's vehicle and it seemingly takes a day to get there. They end up at Christmas Land Theme Park. They encounter Santa and discover that it is Patchy the Pirate disguising as Santa.Patchy proceeds to tell them they are not at the North Pole but rather a theme park. Plankton admonishes the duo for getting them lost while they realize their error. The three explain that they are trying to find the North Pole and Patchy gives them a map to the North Pole. They eventually all make it to the North Pole. They see Santa's workshop and travel to it. An elf tells them that Santa is on vacation and Plankton goes to Santa's computer to put his name on the nice list. SpongeBob and Patrick cause chaos across the workshop, resulting in a fight. Santa arrives and sees that someone has made a mess. Santa sees SpongeBob and says, ""You're a menace!"" to him. SpongeBob reveals that all he wanted was to deliver the present to him. Santa is delighted by the gesture, as he reveals not even the elves or reindeer give him a present, to their embarrassment. SpongeBob gives Santa a bottle with a letter inside and Plankton thinks it's the Krabby Patty secret formula, but finds out that it isn't. Santa, SpongeBob, the reindeer, and the elves tell Plankton to read the letter. Plankton begrudgingly reads it and it is revealed that it is merely a thank you note to Santa for bringing joy and presents to all. Santa is touched and thanks SpongeBob.Next Christmas, Mr. Krabs has a Christmas party at the Krusty Krab and he gives Plankton some coal. SpongeBob gives Plankton a photo of them with Patchy from their mission to the North Pole. Plankton says that he will destroy everyone with his coal-powered death robot, and he feeds coal to the robot. The episode ends with a shot of the Krusty Krab as everyone can be heard screaming inside while the robot attacks them offscreen.",SpongeBob's Road to Christmas,"[The episode opens with a shot of Bikini Bottom, where it is snowing, and the town is decorated for Christmas. Cut to inside SpongeBob's house, where SpongeBob is holding a present for Santa. SpongeBob and Gary are wearing Santa hats.]
SpongeBob: Ta-dah! This gift is for Santa Claus! [kisses present, then places it under a Christmas tree] Even Santa deserves a gift! Right, Gary?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [picks up Gary and spins him, singing to the tune of ""Jingle Bells""] ♪ Santa Claus, Santa Claus, Santa's on his way! [walking upstairs] I'm giving him a present that he'll take back on his sleigh! ♪ [open shot of his house] Yay! [humming the tune of ""Jingle Bells""]
[Pan up to Santa Claus on his sleigh with his reindeer, flying through the sky.]
Santa: Ho, ho, ho! [parks sleigh and approaches SpongeBob's house with a sack] Hmm... [climbs house, trying to fit himself into a pipe, but falls down with it] Oh, yeah, I forgot. [picks up sack] Ho, ho, ho, shrink-o. [sprinkles some dust on him, shrinking him down enough to fit into the pipe]
[Humming the tune to ""Jingle Bells,"" Santa enters the house, dancing as he pulls out SpongeBob's present. His butt kicks SpongeBob's present for him out of the way as he continues dancing, putting it behind SpongeBob's sofa. Santa places his gift underneath the tree, and exits SpongeBob's house.]
Santa: Ho, ho, ho! [slams door]
French Narrator: [narrating time card] Seven months later...
[SpongeBob is vacuuming near the sofa, humming.]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, Mr. Sofa. [lifts up sofa] Ha, look at that, Gary.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: It's the present I left for Santa last Christmas. Isn't that nice? [drops vacuum, panicking] The present I left for Santa last Christmas?! [picks up present] He never got it! Oh, this is the worst disaster that's ever happened!
Gary: [vocalizing ""uh-oh""] Meow, meow...
SpongeBob: My present to Santa is 212 days later. [begins sobbing] Late, it's a tragedy. [blows nose with present bow]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [cradling present] My joyful carefree world is growing dark and dreary! I can't go on! [stops crying] No, I'll go on. [continues crying] But I can't go on! [sobbing]
Patrick: [throws roses at SpongeBob, applauding] Whoo-hoo! [whistles] Whoo-hoo! Five stars.
SpongeBob: [picking up rose, sniffing it] Patrick, I wasn't acting. Santa never got his Christmas present.
Patrick: [shrugs] So why not just deliver it to him?
SpongeBob: Why not just deliver it to him?
Patrick: [chuckles] That's a dumb idea. [claps] I'm in!
SpongeBob: Great! But how will we get there? We can't walk that far. Hmm...
Patrick: [squishes face] Oh, we can push and shove each other!
SpongeBob: Great idea! We can't let it be [picks up present] one more day late. [opens himself and puts the present inside] Okay, me first.
[Patrick shoves SpongeBob ahead, making him roll out of the house. Patrick runs after him, both laughing.]
Patrick: My turn! [SpongeBob shoves him, making him roll on the road]
Bystander: What the--
SpongeBob: [running after Patrick] Merry Christmas! [laughs]
Bystander: Um, it's July?
[Cut to the Chum Bucket, where Plankton opens the doors and comes out.]
Plankton: Ah, it's a good day to be bad. [inhales, then exhales] Huh? [gets crushed by a landing SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [gets up, laughing]
Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob? [points to him] You got a booger.
SpongeBob: [looks at Plankton on his nose] Oh! [eyes dart back and forth]
Patrick: Don't worry, [pulls tissue from armpit] that's what friends are for. [puts tissue up to SpongeBob's nose] Blow.
SpongeBob: [blows into tissue] Thank you.
Patrick: [looking inside tissue] Eww! [turns tissue around] It's the ugliest booger I've ever seen.
Plankton: [escapes tissue] Can't you screwballs walk without falling?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Plankton. [using hand gestures to demonstrate] We're pushing and shoving ourselves all the way to the North Pole. I have to give Santa his Christmas present. [rolls himself up to reveal present]
Plankton: Santa? I hate that guy. He's had me on a naughty list ever since I got this tattoo. [rolls up arm, revealing tattoo that says ""Born to be Naughty""]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Born to be naughty?
Plankton: Whoo! Wait a minute. [pacing] If I can break into Santa's lair, hack his mainframe, change my status from naughty to nice, I could ask [antennae twist] for the Krabby Patty secret formula and he'd have to give it to me. I'm coming with you.
Patrick: [raised hands] Pushed or shoved?
Plankton: Shrimp that! [holds remote, pushing a button] We are going in style, babies.
[The Chum Bucket's garage door opens, revealing a snow plow-like vehicle with a fish tank.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa!
Plankton: I built it to fly and run over bodies during the zombie apocalypse, but it'll work on snow too.
[Bubble transition to Plankton in the vehicle, setting up the GPS.]
Plankton: We'll take the Pacific to the Arctic, then over ice and snow to the North Pole. Easy-peasy, Santa-squeezy. [chuckles, then sees SpongeBob and Patrick laughing in their seats]
Plankton: [unamused] Seat belts. [puts on seat belt]
SpongeBob: Of course, [puts on seat belt] safety first. All secured, Captain Plankton.
Patrick: [stretches pants onto his body] All secured.
Plankton: [groans] I'm already regretting this trip.
[Plankton hits a button on the control panel that says ""BLAST OFF!"", and the vehicle takes off, leaving flames behind. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Plankton are smashed against their seats due to the speed.]
SpongeBob: Whee! [laughs]
Patrick: Ya-hoo!
Mr. Krabs: [humming as he walks to the Krusty Krab, then screams as he notices the vehicle]
[Mr. Krabs runs away from the vehicle as it drives past the Krusty Krab. He then peeks from behind the Krusty Krab. Plankton tries to reach for the steering bars, but fails. The vehicle jumps over some hills, then Plankton successfully grabs the steering bars and pulls them back, making the vehicle fly into the air.]
Plankton: We did it! [looks away] Hmm?
SpongeBob: [looking down at the kids at a playground waving at them] Oh, look at those tiny little fish.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [waving] Hi!
Plankton: Hey, [points] get back to your seats!
Patrick: [points upwards] The seat belt sign is off.
Plankton: [looks above to see the seat belt sign turn off, and groans]
Farmer: [looking up at the flying vehicle, gasps, runs away] The visitors, they're here!
SpongeBob: [looking outside with Patrick] He seemed happy to see us. Oh! [sees a fish sitting in a floating lawn chair held by balloons, as he sips his tea] Ah!
Patrick: Whoa, a flying lawn chair.
Plankton: [rolls eye]
[The scene turns to nighttime. Plankton stretches himself and cracks his neck. SpongeBob breathes on his present and wipes it with a cloth. Plankton jumps up to snatch the gift.]
SpongeBob: Hey!
Plankton: Give me that. [shakes present] What's in this box anyway?
SpongeBob: It's a surprise. [takes back present, twists his eye like a combination lock, and puts the present back inside himself]
Plankton: I hope it's a stink bomb for that pot-bellied jingle joker.
SpongeBob: Santa is not pot-bellied. He just suffers from seasonal bloating.
Plankton: [waves and walks off] Right. [walks to a bed] I'm going to sleep.
SpongeBob: [gesturing to vehicle] But who will fly this thing?
Plankton: [in bed] I put it on automatic pilot. You and that pink moron can sleep on the floor.
[Patrick is snoring on a newspaper bed. SpongeBob takes out his present and uses it as a pillow, and takes one of Patrick's newspapers to use as a blanket. Plankton claps twice to make the light go out. Cut to a first-person view of Plankton, who wakes up to see SpongeBob and Patrick in the front seats.]
Plankton: Hey, what are you imbeciles doing?
SpongeBob: We found the North Pole.
Patrick: It was way closer than you said.
Plankton: North Pole? Impossible. [looks outside] How long was I asleep?
Patrick: [as vehicle approaches the ground] Funny how the ground keeps getting closer.
[The vehicle bumps into a sign that says ""Christmas Land Theme Park,"" and a branch falls off.]
Speaker: [on sign] Welcome to Christmas Land Theme Park. Where every day is Christmas.
Plankton: [jumping onto control panel, pointing to Patrick] Hey, get out of my seat. [both look up to see the seat belt icon come back on]
Patrick: The seat belt sign is on. [grabs Plankton and straps a seat belt to him in a seat, choking him] Cabin crew, prepare for landing! [starts pressing random buttons]
Plankton: [afraid] Do you actually know how to land?
Patrick: I know how to crash land.
[Patrick tugs on the steering bars, making the vehicle do flips in the air as it begins nosediving.]
Plankton: [grabbing onto seat belt] My seat belt! [gets stuck inside seat]
[The vehicle stops nosediving and starts to land, and lightly taps on a pole, causing a giant explosion. SpongeBob and Patrick uncover their eyes and look up to see a ""North Pole"" sign.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: The North Pole!
SpongeBob: [off-screen] We made it!
Plankton: [on windshield, groans, sliding off] Huh? [points to busted navigation system] Look what you two broken brain buffoons did! You completely destroyed the navigation system.
Patrick: You're welcome.
SpongeBob: Don't be mad, [puts fingers in Plankton's mouth to make him smile] Plankton. We're here.
[Plankton's mouth flops downwards. Bubble transition to the trio outside in water helmets.]
SpongeBob: Look at all this. [he and Patrick laugh as they run across the snow, looking at their surroundings]
Plankton: [concerned] Hmm.
SpongeBob: [giggles, looks at garden gnomes] Ooh, Santa's elves!
Patrick: [both gasp, looks at taxidermy deer] Santa's reindeer!
SpongeBob and Patrick: This is amazing!
Plankton: Something's wrong here. It isn't even cold. And look at this smog.
Patrick: [looks at the sky] It's snow and smog?
SpongeBob: It's ""snog."" [both laugh, bang their heads together, and wander off]
Plankton: [sighs and groans]
[With Patrick nearby, SpongeBob hops onto an empty box to look inside a building window.]
SpongeBob: Santa's workshop! [Patrick hops onto the box]
[Inside the building, there are toy elves ""making"" toys on a conveyor belt.]
Toy elves: ♪ Making toys, work, work, work! Making toys, work, work, work! ♪
SpongeBob: [bangs on window] Hello, Santa's elves, I'm SpongeBob! Merry Christmas!
Toy elves: [distorted voices] Make, work-- [one of their heads falls off, and another breaks it with a hammer] make, work--
Plankton: [unamused, SpongeBob frowns] Looks like Santa's gone all in for automation.
SpongeBob: Hey guys, look! [approaching sign on post] It says, [gasps] ""meet Santa Claus!"" [brief shot of the Santa Claus house up ahead, starts taking off] Come on, guys! [giggles]
Patrick: [running after SpongeBob] Let's meet Santa!
Plankton: [walking and grunting]
[Plankton climbs up a step and arrives to the front of the building. SpongeBob and Patrick are already there, with SpongeBob holding his present.]
SpongeBob: We're finally here, little present. [all start walking]
Plankton: Guys, I hate to say this, but this place is a sham. I don't know why, but we're being tricked.
SpongeBob: Oh, Plankton, Christmas is about believing.
Patrick: Yeah, Christmas is about bleeding, man.
[SpongeBob and Patrick look down a messy corridor to see a snoring Santa.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [gasp, look at each other, then run to Santa giggling]
Plankton: I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eye. The bearded weirdo in the flesh.
[SpongeBob and Patrick jump onto Santa's legs. They both start giggling at him, then look at each other.]
Santa: [waking up] What would you like for Christmas?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both speaking at once]
SpongeBob: [overlapping Patrick's gibberish] Oh, besides peace on earth, I'd like a new luxury three-story shelf for Gary, a lifetime supply of ice cream for Patrick, and...
Santa: Pipe down, children. [first person view of him focusing his eyes on Patrick and SpongeBob] What the-- [gasps] SpongeBob SquarePants?
SpongeBob: [waving] Hi, Santa.
Santa: Did you know that I'm your biggest fan?
SpongeBob: Oh, that's very sweet of you Santa, but actually Patchy the Pirate is my biggest fan.
Santa: Ho, ho, ho!
[Santa takes his head off to reveal he is actually Patchy the Pirate.]
Patchy: Ahoy, SpongeBob and Patrick! It's me, Patchy the Pirate.
[SpongeBob and Patrick gasp before their heads disintegrate into confetti.]
SpongeBob: Patchy the Pirate? You're Santa?
Patchy: No, I just play Santa here in Christmas Land Theme Park. [chuckles] It's me side-hustle.
Plankton: Heh. I knew this wasn't the North Pole.
Patchy: North Pole? No, man, this be Encino. You're almost 4,000 miles from the North Pole.
Plankton: [growls, hops onto chair] I'm gonna destroy you two! [crosses arms]
SpongeBob: 4,000 miles? Oh, if only our GPS wasn't busted.
Patchy: Ooh, I can help with [pulls out map] global positioning. Way before GPS, pirates used these things called maps . [rolls up map and gives it to SpongeBob] Oh, and you'll need a compass too.
Potty: [squawks, carrying compass] Happy holidays. [drops compass onto Plankton, crushing him, laughs with Patchy]
Plankton: [raising fist] Polly want a smacker?
SpongeBob: Well, thanks, Patchy. Guess we'll be on our way. [he, Patrick, and Plankton leave]
Patchy: Goodbye! Good luck. If you see Santy Claus, tell him I want a new parrot.
Potty: [squawks, pecking Patchy on the head]
Patchy: Hey!
Potty: And I want a new pirate.
[A map of the United States is shown, with Encino labelled on it. A dotted line extends from Encino and into an oil silo. A drop of red ink falls from the silo and continues along the map, and into an alligator near Florida.]
Plankton: [echoed voice] Wait, where are we?
[All three scream as the red ink dot is spat out by the alligator onto a different part of the map. It goes into a trapdoor and out another one, gets carried by a tornado, goes next to a lumberjack moose, which kicks the dot to the North Pole, where it cuts to the vehicle finally arriving. Plankton is in an ice block, shivering.]
Plankton: [shivering] S-S-Santa's workshop, dead ahead.
SpongeBob: [now icy and blue, shivering] J-j-just in time. I'm f-f-freezing.
Patrick: [now blue, tired] Are we there yet? [eyes crumble from his face]
[The vehicle finally arrives at a building in the North Pole. SpongeBob and Patrick get out, and Patrick is licking Plankton stuck in an ice block.]
SpongeBob: How you doing with that Plankton pop?
Patrick: I can't wait to get to the chewy middle. [close-up of Plankton in the ice block]
Plankton: [groaning]
[They stand on the welcome mat, and SpongeBob gets excited.]
SpongeBob: Hey Patrick, where's Plankton?
Patrick: [shrugs] I don't know.
Plankton: [opens Patrick's mouth and escapes, putting his helmet back on] [points at Patrick] Eat a breath mint, trench mouth.
SpongeBob: All right, here it goes. [knocks on door]
Female elf: [opens door] Huh? [looks down] Aw, you guys look great! I like your spaceman helmets. But it's not Halloween for another three months.
SpongeBob: [shakes head] We're not here for Halloween, we're here for Santa. [Patrick nods]
Plankton: I've got my own agenda so this is where we part company. [puts on elf hat and begins walking]
Female elf: Oh, sorry, Santa's not home. He's in Aruba with the Missus. But... [gives SpongeBob and Patrick candy canes] here you go anyway.
Patrick: [eats candy cane, which makes him dazed]
SpongeBob: [bites candy cane] But--but--
Female elf: Happy Halloween! [slams door]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [notice something] Huh?
[In the window, figures are seen partying inside the building. Patrick climbs up on the window, and they both peek inside to see the elves partying.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa!
SpongeBob: [gasps]
[Inside, Plankton tries to dodge the dancing elves. He gets kicked into the air and gets back up with a black eye.]
SpongeBob: Hey, that's Plankton. He's inside.
Patrick: Hmm?
SpongeBob: [knocks on window glass]
Plankton: Eh? [sticks tongue out] Bleh. [walks off] Jeez.
SpongeBob: I have to get Santa's present under his tree. We've got to get inside.
Patrick: [eyes turn into lightbulbs] Ah! I'm on it! [runs off]
SpongeBob: Hmm, I know! We'll go in Santa style. [gestures downward] Down the chimney.
Patrick: [driving a wrecking crane] Oh, fine, we'll go with your idea.
[Cut back to Plankton, who is walking by some stables.]
Plankton: Hmm, now where in Kris Kringle is Santa's mainframe?
[He sees some muscular reindeer working out inside a room.]
Plankton: [continues walking] No mainframe, just lame brains. [stops before Santa's workshop as he hears a reindeer talk to him]
Bludolph: Yo, where do you think you're going?
Plankton: [high-pitched] Who, me? I'm just a little elf!
Bludolph: [sniffs] You don't smell like no elf.
Plankton: Oh, yeah? What's it to you, [kicks snow into reindeer's face] you moose?
Bludolph: [snorts] Hey! Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen!
Plankton: [whimpers as the reindeer surround him] Well, looks like we got a whole Christmas special here. [gets picked up by Bludolph] Whoa!
Bludolph: Ready for some reindeer games?
Plankton: Eh, peace on earth? [the reindeer begin to kick him around] Whoa! Oof, oof, ow! That better be mud on your hooves. Whoa!
[Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick arrive inside the workshop's chimney.]
SpongeBob: [gasps as he notices a Christmas tree up ahead] That's it! Santa's Christmas tree. [both giggle as they laugh and run to the tree, until a spotlight shines on them as an alarm goes off]
Female elf: [opens door, with other elves, angry] There they are! It's the trick-or-treaters!
Male elf: Toy thieves!
Other male elf: Christmas crooks! Get 'em! [all run inside]
Patrick: [scared] SpongeBob, what do we do?
SpongeBob: [panicking] Climb! [both start climbing up the tree]
Female elf: [all under tree] They're going up the tree! Don't let 'em get away!
[Bludolph notices the alarm outside Santa's Workshop.]
Bludolph: We better check that alarm! [gestures inside as the other reindeer enter, all trampling Plankton]
Plankton: [gets up, taking off elf outfit, walking weakly inside] I wore you down, didn't I? Yeah. You meat head cari-boobs.
[The reindeer arrive at the scene, where the elves are throwing things at SpongeBob and Patrick.
Male elf: Toy thieves!
[A toy duck hits Patrick, who is hanging onto a garland on the tree. Another toy flies past Bludolph's head.]
Bludolph: Yo, elves! What the Father Christmas is going on here?
Female elf: We got this under control. Go back to your stables. [throws Rubik's cube at the tree, breaking an ornament]
[The elves continue throwing things, and some even climb the tree.]
Reindeer: [gets hit with a toy truck, rubs head] Oh! Not cool, elf bros. [picks up another toy truck and throws it at an elf, which hits him and falls onto his head]
Other female elf: [growls, then swings from a garland and shouts]
Reindeer: [ducks, dodging the elf] Whoa!
[The female elf crashes into a wall, leaving behind a giant crack. She falls down and Lego pieces fall onto the ground.]
Reindeer: [laughs]
Male elf: Hey! [points to reindeer with wooden stake] Not funny. [throws stake, which the reindeer dodges]
[The reindeer leaps onto the ceiling fan, and begins spinning] Whoa, whoa! [crushes several elves as he lands, and a toy train comes by to crush his snout]
SpongeBob: [looking down] Oh, no, Patrick. It looks like I have sowed the seeds of discontent in the house of Santa. [sees Patrick] Patrick? Huh?
Patrick: [dazed, reaching for candy cane on the tree] Candy cane...oh!
SpongeBob: [gasps as he notices an elf climbing the tree] Oh... [throws ornament at elf, which breaks on his face]
Male elf: [unfazed, cackles, continues climbing]
Plankton: [walking by the chaos, and almost gets stepped on by a reindeer, groans] [gasps, seeing Santa's mainframe] Santa's mainframe. I found it! [runs towards it, and begins typing his name on the computer] Thanks to those two idiots causing a distraction, I did it. [wipes hands, walking away] My name is on the nice list. [jumps back down and begins walking away] Now I just gotta be good for the next few months. How hard could that be. He-he-he-- [gets stepped on by Santa] wah!
Santa: [in a summer outfit] Oh! What the [raises sunglasses] ho, ho, ho is going on here? [the elves and reindeer look at him] I was kicking back with the Missus in the Caribbean when my silent alarm went off.
[The female elf points to the tree, where the male elf from earlier chuckles as he is right next to SpongeBob on a branch.]
Male elf: [noticing Santa] Huh? [smiles at Santa]
SpongeBob: [waving] Hi, Santa.
Santa: SpongeBob? Ho, ho, I should've known! [points to SpongeBob] You're a menace.
SpongeBob: [laughs, jumps down onto Santa's hand and pulls out the present] All I wanted to do was leave you this present that you didn't get last Christmas. 213 days late. Sorry!
Santa: A present is never too late. Oh, how sweet. Not even the elves or reindeer get me presents.
[The elves and reindeer look at each other awkwardly.]
Santa: Thank you, SpongeBob. [takes present] Should I open it now?
SpongeBob: [jumps onto Santa's shoulder, nodding] Uh-huh, uh-huh!
[Santa pops open the present, and grabs the secret formula. The reindeer and elves gasp.]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] It's one of a kind.
Plankton: [with bottle of glue to fix his helmet, then gasps] The Krabby Patty secret formula? He's giving it to Santa Claus! Forget the list, the formula's right here. I could have it now! [laughing as he climbs up Santa]
Santa: [looks down] Huh?
Plankton: [jumps and grabs the formula, landing on the nearby table]
Santa: Huh? Plankton? [points to him] You're being naughty.
Plankton: Santa, [flexes bicep with ""Born to be Naughty"" tattoo] I was born to be naughty.
Santa and SpongeBob: [gasp, then grunt]
Plankton: [pulls out paper and laughs, muttering as he reads it, then rolls it back up] Um, yeah... [holds out paper] you can have this back. My bad, heh. I mean, good--my good. I'm being nice, not naughty.
Santa: Well, read it out loud.
Plankton: Uh, that's okay.
Santa: Go on, read it.
Reindeer and elves: Read it!
Plankton: [reading] ""Dear Santa, there isn't a present big enough to express how much joy you've brought to all the children and sea creatures of the world. So this is just a simple thank you note. Thank you. Signed, with love, your pal SpongeBob.""
[The reindeer and elves coo, and Bludolph has an elf in a headlock.]
Plankton: You got a typo here.
Santa: [tearing up] Oh, how touching. [wipes tear] This is beautiful. Thank you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I wouldn't have made it here without the help of [gestures to Plankton] Plankton. He's really not that naughty. And of course, my best friend Patrick. Patrick?
Patrick: [dazed, holding some candy canes with his water helmet off] Happy holidays to me!
French Narrator: [reading time card] The next Christmas.
[Cut to the Krusty Krab decorated for the holidays in the snowy winter. The customers are giving each other presents as Mr. Krabs walks out of the office with Santa hats on his eye stalks, holding a present.]
Woman: Aww, here you go!
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Happy holidays, everybody. [gives present to Plankton] Sheldon.
Plankton: [opens present and pulls out a lump of coal] Lump of coal. [tosses coal lump into a giant pile of it]
SpongeBob: [placing another present next to Plankton] Merry Christmas, Plankton.
Plankton: Another lump of coal, no doubt. [opens present and pulls out a letter] What's this? [reading note with a picture of Patchy holding him, Patrick, and SpongeBob] ""Merry Christmas to Plankton! One day you will destroy us all."" Yes, I will, SpongeBob. Yes, I will. [cackles, then grabs a shovel to scoop up the coal to put into a giant robot] Destroy!
Robot: [roars, releasing fire]

Marvin is on the phone as SpongeBob, who is volunteering, walks in. He is asked by Marvin to stop letting the worms use the phone. Marvin is then on the phone with Squidward, who is complaining that there is a worm outside his house who will not stop barking. Marvin gets on the case right away as he puts SpongeBob in charge while he is gone. SpongeBob promises that he will do his job to the best of his ability. He nervously walks over to Butcher the worm's cage, who growls when he tries to pet him.Marvin arrives back at the animal shelter with Patrick, who turned out to be the worm Squidward was complaining about. Patrick, acting a like a worm, drags Marvin around before going to see SpongeBob. He then goes to eat worm food that SpongeBob just poured out of a bag. Marvin is not thrilled by Patrick's behavior as SpongeBob seeks to train him.It is night, and SpongeBob brings Patrick to his home. He then calls Gary over, telling him that he brought him a playmate. They do not get along very well. They resort to destroying SpongeBob's living room from their chasing. Patrick proceeds to bark all night, angering Squidward. He knocks on his door and a drowsy SpongeBob answers. Not knowing who Squidward is, Patrick bursts through the entrance trying to attack him. SpongeBob pulls Squidward away from him and into his house. SpongeBob says that he does not know what to do now that Patrick is back in his worm state. Squidward tells him that taming a worm is not so hard and that he should be giving him tough love. SpongeBob then pleads to him, asking if he could give tough love to Patrick. He tells SpongeBob to beg him, in which he responds to by acting like a dog. Squidward accepts, before telling SpongeBob to play dead.The next scene shows a caged Patrick and Squidward in protective gear. He tries to teach Patrick how to heel, but that fails. Squidward has had enough and takes Patrick out to abandon him. Squidward returns home and has a knock on his door. It turns out Patrick has come back with stickers on his body, implying he has traveled around the world.Squidward gives Patrick a shock collar. He puts it on him and tells him that whenever he barks, he will ""give him a mild tough-love shock."" When he tries to use it, it only vibrates, much to Squidward's intentions. He assumes it is broken and tries to take it off, only for it to work on him. Squidward takes Patrick out to abandon him again, instead with Patrick caged up. When Squidward returns home, he opens his door and an angry Patrick comes out. This time, it is Patrick taking Squidward out to abandon him.Squidward drags himself home, and tries to open the door. Patrick answers and growls at him. Marvin shows up and tells Squidward that SpongeBob said that he has trained Patrick using tough love. He tells him that it is impossible to train him and he cannot get him to sit - which Patrick does. He says he tried to get him to beg - which Patrick does, too. Then he starts giving him usual (and unusual) dog commands, ending with ""play dead."" Marvin is impressed and calls Squidward a miracle worker. Marvin then gives Squidward a problem worm that is in need of training: Butcher.Patrick turns back to normal as SpongeBob notices. It is revealed that Patrick snapped out of his worm state hours ago and just wanted to make Squidward feel proud of himself. Hearing commotion from his house, SpongeBob hopes he is not too rough on him. Finally, they both come out, but Butcher is walking Squidward on a leash, and Butcher greets the two. Surprised from such a sight, they both drop and play dead with flowers in their hands, ending the episode.",Pat the Dog,"[The episode begins at an animal shelter. The camera goes inside the place, and there is a snail trying to grab a key next to him to get out. Marvin is talking on the phone.]
Marvin: Hello, animal control. [the telephone gets covered in slime] Ew. SpongeBob, I appreciate you volunteering here at the animal shelter, but could you [grabs a worm] please stop letting the worms use the phone?! [throws the worm to the floor]
SpongeBob: Oh, I told them no more takeout calls.
[SpongeBob moves a bucket to catch the worm's drool. A worm nearby is shown, along with several takeout boxes full of food. The worm burps.]
Marvin: [groans] [on the phone] Now, how can I help you?
Squidward: [on the phone] There's a worm somewhere outside my house, and it won't stop barking.
Marvin: [leans in and pushes the split screen narrower, surprising Squidward] I'll get on that right away. [hangs up and puts down the worm in his net, and gets up] I gotta go catch a stray. SpongeBob, you hold down the fort.
SpongeBob: [saluting] Sir, yes, sir! I will take care of these wild worms to the best of my ability. [his limbs become worms and he laughs]
[Marvin groans and leaves. A worm strangles SpongeBob as the scene bubble transitions to SpongeBob tucking worms into bed. He fluffs a worm's pillow.]
SpongeBob: [humming while walking over to a cage and then gasps] Uh-oh. B-B-Butcher's cage. [nervous whimpering as he tiptoes over to the cage]
[Butcher barks, causing SpongeBob to scream, and he holds up a white flag]
SpongeBob: Butcher? I know you're really a good boy. Just let me pet you, real gentle. [sticks his hand into the cage] That a boy.
[Butcher growls and snarls as he makes the cage shake. SpongeBob falls down]
SpongeBob: [gasps as he realizes his arm was bitten off] I hope he doesn't develop a taste for sponge. [He grows back his arm and screams again as Butcher growls again. Butcher eats SpongeBob's arms and feet left behind.]
[The scene bubble transitions to outside the animal shelter, where the animal control truck arrives. Marvin is carrying Patrick on a leash. Patrick barks as Marvin drags him around. Patrick goes into a cell and drags Marvin out through the bars, compressing him into a rectangle. Patrick comes free and jumps away. SpongeBob is feeding a worm.]
SpongeBob: [excited] Patrick!
[SpongeBob pours the entire bag of food on the worm. It pops out and eats it.]
SpongeBob: [hugs Patrick] Yeah! Aw, who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?
[Marvin walks in.]
Marvin: [panting] Huh?
[Patrick licks SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Patrick's my friend. Sometimes if he's eaten worm food by mistake, he goes into worm mode. [Patrick growls and eats the worm food.] There's no telling how long it'll last.
Marvin: Well, if he's not trained in a few days so he can be adopted, he'll have to be [points to his keys] locked up. Like Butcher.
[Butcher growls. A nearby worm jumps and is scared out of his skin.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, sir. I'll train him. He's already housebroken. [Patrick pees on SpongeBob. SpongeBob nervously laughs.] I knew he was broken. I thought it was house. [Patrick chews on Marvin's mop.]
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob training Patrick outside the shelter.]
SpongeBob: Now, Patrick, every good worm needs to learn how to do tricks. Then they get [takes out a treat] wormy treats as a reward! Now, sit!
Patrick: [grabs a lawn chair and lays on it]
SpongeBob: Um... almost. Let's try another one. Shake!
Patrick: [shakes so hard that he vibrates the ground]
SpongeBob: [pants] Shall we try roll over?
Patrick: [rolls around and knocks over SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Wait!
[Patrick rolls through town, knocking over people and causing cars to crash. He rolls through people like bowling pins exiting a subway. A man in the subway tunnel sees Patrick roll past and checks his watch.]
Businessman: Rolling Star Express, right on time.
[Patrick rolls back to SpongeBob, bites the box and pours the treats into his mouth, and pants. Patrick's body is scuffed up.]
SpongeBob: I know one wormy that needs a bath.
Patrick: [growls]
SpongeBob: Okay, okay, no bath, no bath! [pushes Patrick through the shelter] Here, Patrick. Worms learn from other worms. [pushes him in the back yard] They'll show you how to be a good boy.
Patrick: Hmm?
[Patrick looks around and sees the worms being sophisticated and well-behaved.]
French Narrator: [narrating time card] One hour later...
[SpongeBob walks in, drinking a soda. Reacting to what he sees, it squirts out of his holes. The worms are racing and Patrick waves a flag as they pass the finish line. Marvin comes in and gasps. Patrick leads some worms to crash through the wall. Marvin approaches him.]
Patrick: Huh?
Marvin: [grabs Patrick with his pole] This worm is a menace. I'm afraid he'll have to be locked up, like Butcher.
SpongeBob: Please don't do that! I'll adopt him! I'll take him home! He'll be my rescue.
Marvin: And you'll take [holds Patrick towards him] full responsibility for him?
Patrick: [panting]
SpongeBob: I promise.
Marvin: Well, that's good. I really didn't want to have to fix him, anyway.
Patrick: [rolls around]
SpongeBob: [balances on Patrick] Thank you, thank you! [rolls on Patrick out of the building] Patrick! Whoa, boy! Heel! [a car crashes into the animal control van] Sorry!
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob's house at night.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary! I brought you a playmate!
Gary: [shows up with a plate, goblet, and can of snail food on his head] Meow?
Patrick: [aggressive barking]
Gary: [screeches]
Patrick: [aggressive barking]
[SpongeBob tries to restrain Patrick. Patrick gets loose and chases Gary around, causing a mess.]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Gary! No! Stop!
[Gary hides in the TV. Patrick sniffs around and doesn't see him. The TV falls over and Gary sticks his eyes out. Patrick chews on the couch. He tears up the sofa and lays down on it. Gary pokes his eyes out of his shell and SpongeBob's body has retracted into his pants, besides his eyes. Exterior shot of the house; Patrick keeps barking all through the night.]
Squidward: [wakes up and yells off-screen] SpongeBob! [knocks at SpongeBob's door] Come on...
[An extremely exhausted SpongeBob answers the door, surprising Squidward.]
SpongeBob: [groans] I'm sorry. Was the noise bothering you? [eyes droop down]
[Patrick leaps through the doorway and attacks Squidward. SpongeBob jumps out of the way, shaping his body like the doorway.]
Patrick: [growling]
SpongeBob: Patrick, heel!
[SpongeBob grabs Squidward and puts him upright. They run away as Patrick chases them. SpongeBob slams the door on Patrick, leaving an imprint. He breathes heavily.]
Squidward: [looking at the destruction in SpongeBob's house] Jeez...
Squidward: Huh. Look, I don't care what kind of weird and stupid parties you throw, I'm just asking that you keep your pet quiet !
SpongeBob: I am at my wit's end! Patrick is in worm mode again. But this time, he's out of control.
Squidward: Oh, any worm can be tamed. Even one as dumb as Patrick. He just needs tough love.
SpongeBob: [grabs Squidward] Would you tough-love Patrick, Squidward?
Squidward: No way.
Patrick: [barks and slams into the door three times]
SpongeBob: Please, Squidward. I bet you're the best worm trainer ever! Please!
Squidward: [laughs] Beg me.
SpongeBob: [barks and licks Squidward]
Squidward: Okay... sit.
[SpongeBob sits.]
Squidward: Huh? Well, I'm a good idiot trainer. [considering] And since Patrick's an idiot... Okay, I'll train him. But only if you play dead--
[SpongeBob gasps and falls on his back as a dramatic music sting plays.]
Squidward: [laughs] And stay playing dead. [steps over him] I've got an idiot to train.
[Bubble transition to Patrick locked in a cage in Squidward's house. Squidward, wearing a helmet and padded bodysuit, approaches the cage. Squidward takes out a ""How to Train Worms"" book.]
Squidward: We'll start with something simple: I'll teach you how to heel. Now... be a good boy.
[Squidward opens the cage. Patrick growls, leaps out, and tackles him.]
Squidward: Heel! Stop! Heel!
[Patrick chews up Squidward and throws him out of his bodysuit, locking him in the cage.]
Squidward: All right, that's it!
[Bubble transition to Squidward driving with Patrick in the boat. He stops in the kelp forest and kicks Patrick out.]
Squidward: Have a nice life. [drives away, spraying mud on Patrick]
[The kelp forest is empty. A coyote howls. Bubble transition to Squidward driving back to his house. SpongeBob continues laying in the front step.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! I'm still playing dead. [laughs]
[Squidward ignores him and walks back into his house, humming.]
Squidward: Tough love. [laughs]
[There's pounding at the door.]
Squidward: Huh?
[Patrick is at the door, covered in stickers from traveling. He jumps on Squidward and pins him down. Squidward shivers. Bubble transition to Patrick in a high chair, with Squidward taking a collar out of a box.]
Squidward: This, my little barking friend, is a shock collar. [puts it on Patrick's neck and takes out a remote] Whenever you bark, I'll push this button and give you a mild tough-love shock.
[Squidward activates the remote. Patrick enjoys it and drools.]
Squidward: Hmm? [shakes remote] Nothing? [keeps hitting the button] Oh, it must be broken.
[Squidward keeps turning the dial and pressing the button, but nothing happens. He throws it on the ground, shattering it.]
Squidward: Nuts!
[Squidward kicks the box away and tries to take the collar off Patrick, but when he touches it, he gets electrocuted. The collar breaks.]
Patrick: [barks]
[Bubble transition to Squidward driving through the kelp forest again. Patrick is locked in a cage attached to the boat. Squidward cuts the rope with scissors and leaves Patrick behind. Patrick stares with an angry expression. SpongeBob is still in Squidward's front yard.]
SpongeBob: Still playing dead!
Squidward: [mutters]
[Squidward enters his house, but Patrick is already there. Patrick jumps on him and growls. Bubble transition to Squidward in the boat, but it turns out Patrick is driving him. He kicks Squidward out of the boat and barks angrily, then sprays mud on him and drives off. Bubble transition to an injured Squidward dragging himself back home, with the boat crashed in his house. Patrick is already in the house. Marvin comes by.]
Marvin: Excuse, Mr. Squidward. SpongeBob tells me that you've trained Patrick using tough love.
Squidward: Patrick? He's impossible. I've tried to get him to sit--
[Patrick barks and sits, then looks up at Squidward affectionately and pants.]
Squidward: Hmm... Okay, well, then I tried to get him to beg--
[Patrick begs and pants.]
Squidward: Spin.
[Patrick spins around rapidly.]
Squidward: Now shake.
[Patrick enthusiastically shakes Squidward's hand and body, leaving him dizzy.]
Squidward: Cheerleader split.
[Patrick does a split.]
Squidward: Chicken.
[Patrick turns into a chicken and clucks .]
Squidward: Chicken nugget.
[Patrick turns into a live-action chicken nugget.]
Squidward: Air guitar.
[Patrick rocks out on an air guitar. He stops and pants. Marvin looks on, impressed, and Squidward laughs.]
Squidward: Now play dead.
[Patrick leaps into the air and falls on his back as a funeral sting plays.]
Marvin: What? You did it! You're a miracle worker!
Squidward: Well, I don't like to brag, but--
Marvin: [shakes Squidward's hand] That's great. We've got a problem worm that needs training.
Squidward: What?
Marvin: [whistles] Bring him in, fellas!
[A man is motioning to an animal control truck. Two helicopters shine spotlights on it. Marvin runs to the truck and pulls a lever.]
Marvin: Say hello to Butcher.
[Butcher's cage slides out of the truck and hits Squidward.]
Squidward: [screams]
[The door locks behind Squidward. Marvin drives away. SpongeBob comes out of his house.]
Squidward: Heel, heel! Ah, stop--heel, heel--fetch, heel, heel!
SpongeBob: Hey, you're not a worm anymore!
Patrick: Nah, I snapped out of it hours ago. I just wanted Squidward to feel like he did a good job.
Squidward: [off-screen] All right, that's enough! I'll teach you!
SpongeBob: Yeah, I hope Squidward's not too tough on him.
Squidward: Will you sit--good dog, sit. Will you sit? No--don't!
[Butcher comes out of Squidward's house, walking Squidward on a leash.]
Butcher: Good afternoon, gentlemen. Nice day for a walk.

He thinks that it is Patrick, but it is actually a clam choking on a pearl. The clam coughs up the pearl with Patrick's assistance, and Patrick thinks that it is a volleyball. The two take the pearl to the local volleyball court, where the worker offers SpongeBob a ""small fortune"" for it. The ""small fortune"" turns out to be billions of dollars that are delivered to SpongeBob's house by several trucks.SpongeBob and Patrick use a portion of the money to buy lifetime supplies of strawberry gum at the Bikini Bottom Mall. Later, at an ice cream stand, SpongeBob overhears another fish complaining that he is short on change, so he offers the fish money, and they become his friends. SpongeBob is so overtaken by fame that he forgets Patrick is his best friend, and he keeps giving money to his rich ""friends.""The next time Patrick sees SpongeBob, he has turned his pineapple into a huge golden mansion. SpongeBob's butler will not allow Patrick in, so Patrick tells him his shoe is untied, which it was, and slips past him. Inside, SpongeBob is wearing fancy, expensive clothes and is telling jokes to his new ""friends"" and handing out money to anyone who asks for some. Patrick tries to warn SpongeBob that his so-called ""friends"" are just using him and that if he keeps throwing away his money, he will not have any, but is cut off by Mr. Krabs who kicks him out. Eventually, so many people have used him for his money that SpongeBob runs out completely. He searches both pockets, his safe, his closet, even his toilet, but there is no money left. SpongeBob returns and tells everyone this and discovers they are all gone, except Mr. Krabs, who tells him not to be late for work tomorrow, mad at SpongeBob for being out of money.SpongeBob returns to his normal life, and he apologizes to Patrick for not listening to him.

[a high-pitched scream in the distance] I'd know that sound anywhere! It's a terrifying shriek! But where's it coming from? [looks from behind a rock and finds Patrick shrieking] Patrick, what is with all the shrieking? You know I walk here on Tuesdays.
Patrick: Sorry, SpongeBob. That wasn't me.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I know I heard a terrifying shriek.
Patrick: So did I, SpongeBob, but I was just mimicking it.
SpongeBob: [Patrick mimicking] So, you were mimicking it. Patrick, please don't do that. It is really...
[A terrifying shriek is heard.]
SpongeBob: Wait a minute, if the shriek wasn't coming from you, then where was it... it's over there, behind that kelp shrub!
[A giant clam behind the kelp bush is shrieking.]
SpongeBob: The terrifying shriek must've come from this clam.
[The clam starts coughing violently.]
SpongeBob: [Patrick mimicking] Hey, Patrick, I think there's something wrong with...
[The clam is coughing and wheezing.]
SpongeBob: W-W-What are we gonna do?
Patrick: Well, the last time I remember coughing like that, I was sitting at home, eating a box of Kelp Jerky.
SpongeBob: Oh, and you were coughing because you got something stuck in your throat?
Patrick: I got the TV remote stuck in my throat.
SpongeBob: Patrick, this clam is choking! Luckily, I come prepared! [pulls out a bottle of bubble soap] There, there, Clammy. [takes out the bubble wand and spreads a line of soap under the clam's bottom lip]
Patrick: SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: They like this!
Patrick: No! You always give a choking victim... the Slimelich maneuver, first! And if that doesn't work, you walk away and pretend like you never saw them before. [walks behind the clam] Like this! Ready, clam? [grabs the clam, tries to lift it, sprains his back, and screams in pain] Well, SpongeBob, I think I might go catch a movie.
SpongeBob: Hey, what about the clam?
Patrick: What clam? I've never seen that clam before in my life.
SpongeBob: But if...
[The clam spits out a pearl.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick, the clam had a baby!
Patrick: That's not a baby, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Well, then, what could it be?
Patrick: I'll give you a hint: what's white, round, and comes out of clams?
SpongeBob: Their... eyes?
Patrick: No, silly! A volleyball!
SpongeBob: A baby volleyball!

Harold: I got it! Ugh!
SpongeBob: Good idea coming here, Patrick.
Patrick: That's my specialty.
SpongeBob: Having good ideas?
Patrick: No, being called Patrick.
SpongeBob: Maybe we should do some stretches, first.
Patrick: Good idea!
SpongeBob: Well, that's my specialty.
Patrick: Having good ideas?
SpongeBob: Nope, doing some stretches, first.
[Cut to an appraisal clerk talking on the phone.]
Clerk: Yeah... No... I don't know, the thing's a hundred years old, how should I know? Yeah, alright, look, if you don't want it... [sees SpongeBob's pearl. Dreamily] Uh-huh... Yeah... We'll see... Huh, yeah. I'm... I'm... I'm still here. [hangs up]
SpongeBob: 138, 139,
Clerk: Gentlemen.
SpongeBob: Hello.
Clerk: I couldn't help noticing what a lovely ball that is.
SpongeBob: Oh, really?
Clerk: Yes. I'd sure like to get a closer look.
SpongeBob: We don't mind, do we Patrick?
Patrick: Well, just don't take too long. We were just about to start playing with it.
Clerk: Oh, it uh... it won't take long at all. [picks up the pearl] Ooh, it's heavier than I imagined. And, uh, shinier, too. Where'd you find it?
SpongeBob: We found it deep in Jellyfish Fields.
Clerk: Really? What was it doing there?
SpongeBob: Choking a clam.
Clerk: Well, um... ahem... what would you say if I were to offer you a small fortune in exchange for your shiny ball?
Patrick: What do you mean, 'small fortune?'
[Cut to hundreds of trucks bring cash to SpongeBob's house while SpongeBob and Patrick eat Kelp Jerky.]
SpongeBob: Whoa. How many more trucks do you think there'll be, Patrick?
Patrick: Huh? Oh, I don't know. I am getting kinda hungry, though. I'll catch up with you later, SpongeBob.
[The last truck leaves.]
SpongeBob: Well, that looked like the last of them.
Patrick: The last of what?
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Patrick.
Patrick: So, did you figure out what you're gonna do with this fat stack of cabbage, yet?
SpongeBob: Yup... I mean, nope.
Patrick: Well, my dad always told me: when you have money, you need to do more than just spend it. You need to have a plan.
SpongeBob: Wow, your dad really told you that?
Patrick: Well, what he said was, ""How many times do I have to tell you not to stand there?"" But I knew what he meant.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, I know a good place to go when you don't know what to buy.
Patrick: You do?
SpongeBob: The mall!

[They then go to listen to headphones. SpongeBob's headphones work, but Patrick's don't play any music. He pulls at the cord without realizing that both their headphones are connected, and pulls off the top of SpongeBob's head, revealing his brain. Patrick puts it back on, and SpongeBob puts his hand on Patrick's shoulder. They head home.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, that was the best shopping day ever!
Patrick: You can say that again!
SpongeBob: Best shopping day ever! Patrick, I got an idea!
Patrick: Really?
SpongeBob: Let's go shopping again! And this time, buy stuff!
[They head home from the mall with shopping carts and money sticking out of their clothes.]
SpongeBob: Oh, wasn't that incredible, Patrick? I mean, with all this money, we could've bought anything in the whole world!
Patrick: Yup!
SpongeBob: So tell me, what'd you buy?
Patrick: A lifetime supply of strawberry gum!
SpongeBob: Hey, me, too! And to think we barely even put a dent in my fortune!
French Narrator: The following Thursday...
[At an ice cream stall.]
SpongeBob: Two, please: one for me and one for my best friend, Patrick.
Lou: I didn't really ask who they were for.
SpongeBob: Thanks. [gives him a wad of bills] There you go.
Lou: It was only fifty-nine cents for the ice cream.
SpongeBob: Oh, that't okay. I kinda have more money than I know what to do with right now.
Lou: Looks like my ex-wife was wrong. I am in the right line of work!
Bill: Uh, triple-blueberry sundae, please. Extra nuts.
Lou: Sure. That's gonna be $2.98.
Bill: Uh... hey Bert, you got like eight cents I can borrow?
Bert: Yeah, let me check... no, I don't, Bill, Sorry.
Bill: You know, why is it I always have money when you need to borrow it?
Bert: Well, I don't know what to say... I...
SpongeBob: Are you gentlemen low on funds? Let me help. [gives wad to Bill] Here you go.
Bill: Whoa. Uh, t-that's okay, I just need eight cents.
SpongeBob: That's okay, I already got my ice cream. See?
Bill: Okay, um... thanks.
SpongeBob: Sure thing. Do you need some, too, Bert?
Bert: Okay!
Dale: Excuse me, can I have some, too?
SpongeBob: Oh, you wanna buy some ice cream?
Dale: No, I'm allergic. But, I'll be your best friend.
SpongeBob: It's a deal!
Bill: Hey, I think I can hang out with this guy for a while.
Bert: Me, too!
Dale: Me, too!
Lou: Me, three!
[The crowd leaves with SpongeBob.]
Patrick: Ice cream?
[Patrick knocks on SpongeBob's new mansion.]
Butler: Hmm... yes?
Patrick: Uh... I'm here to see SpongeBob.
Butler: I know, you on the guest list, sir?
Patrick: Well, I don't think so. Normally, I...
Butler: Well, then, I'm afraid I can't let you in, sir. Good day, sir.
Patrick: Good day. Uh, your shoe's untied.
Butler: Hmm, right-o, it is. [Patrick smells something from inside and walks in] Thank you, sir. [realizes Patrick is gone]
Bert: And so, he was like, do you wanna buy some ice cream? Ha ha, ice cream! Can you imagine?
Bill: Ha ha, yeah. Ah, I love that story!
Patrick: Uh, hey guys. Have you seen SpongeBob around?
Bert: Eh... is that guy talking to us?
Bill: Just don't move. Or breathe. He might go away.
Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob!
Nat Peterson: Hey, pal, watch it. I can buy and sell you!
SpongeBob: And I said, go ahead, let's do it right now! I got too much hair, anyways.
Crowd: [laughs]
Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: That's my name, don't wear it out.
Patrick: SpongeBob, I gotta tell you something I think you should know: your house is full of strangers!
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, these aren't strangers. These are 497 of my closest friends. Right, everybody? [crowd cheers] That's right!
[SpongeBob throws cash in the air and the crowd cheers and grabs for it.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, do you hear that? That is the sound of love.
Patrick: SpongeBob, if you keep throwing your money away like that, you won't have any left, and then--
Mr. Krabs: Excuse me sir, is this man giving you trouble?
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Like I was saying...
Patrick: But--
Mr. Krabs: We don't want any trouble, now just keep moving.
Teenage fish: Dude, how did you get in there?
SpongeBob: And I told him, it's not that I mind the macaroni, what I mind is...
Mr. Krabs: Sorry about that, SpongeBob. Won't happen again.
SpongeBob: No matter, he's simply jealous of my glamorous new lifestyle.
Mr. Krabs: Say, that reminds me... can I have some money?
SpongeBob: Why, certainly. I always remember to... [pulls out empty pocket. Crowd gasps] Oh, I forgot. I keep it in this other pocket. [empty pocket. Crowd gasps] Uh, will you excuse me for a moment?
[SpongeBob checks his safe, then his piggy bank, and his golden toilet, but doesn't find any money. He turns around with a grotesque look of horror on his face. SpongeBob continues searching through his cabinet, jar, bed, plant, and Gary's shell. His search ends with him looking into a drawer, realizing that much to his horror, he has no money left. He cries out in sadness and returns to the party.]
SpongeBob: Well, everyone, I hope this doesn't put a damper on things, but I just checked and, well it's just that all my money is... [everyone is gone] gone. [falls flat on his face as Mr. Krabs passes by, angry over SpongeBob running out of money]
Mr. Krabs: Don't be late for work tomorrow, boy.
[Cut to Patrick's rock, where Patrick is relaxing.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh, hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Whatcha doing?
Patrick: Oh, the same thing us sea stars are usually doing, I guess. Laying up against a rock.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I was wrong.
Patrick: About what?
SpongeBob: The money, and about those people being my friends.
Patrick: There is no right or wrong when it comes to that stuff, SpongeBob. There just either 'is' or there 'isn't.'
SpongeBob: Patrick, if having a bunch of money makes me forget that you're my best friend, then I don't want any more money, ever again.
Patrick: Well, why didn't you say so, buddy? I've been waiting for someone to go break in my new volleyball with!
SpongeBob: You got another new volleyball?
Patrick: Yup, I found it!
SpongeBob: Found it? Where?

As this happens, SpongeBob, driving with Mrs. Puff, crashes a boat into the nursery. Not being able to see his surroundings, SpongeBob almost drives into the fish while doing this, but the baby saves them and carries them out of the nursery. SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff drive into multiple buildings, until their boat drives into the ribbon of the opening of the Dynamite Factory. They are launched into the air and then crash into Mrs. Puff's house. After SpongeBob leaves, Mrs. Puff, now in bed, questions if he is unteachable, but immediately urges herself to seek guidance.Mrs. Puff calls a guru to alert him of the trouble that SpongeBob is causing her. He recommends Mrs. Puff to figure out how she can be with SpongeBob, without actually being in his presence. At Boating School, she questions how she can follow the guru's advice, as music plays from a submarine above her. She disguises herself using a mask, and jumps onto the window of the submarine, which is boarded by the French Narrator. Mrs. Puff notices that the French Narrator is cutting potatoes, and uses a glass cutter to sneak in. She steals one and leaves through the hole she created in the window, flooding the submarine.At Boating School, Mrs. Puff puts the potato in a boat and disguises it as her, using lipstick and her hair. She attaches a walkie-talkie to the potato as SpongeBob approaches, then hides in the lighthouse. SpongeBob, unaware of the situation, assumes the potato is Mrs. Puff, as the real Puff speaks through the walkie-talkie. SpongeBob proceeds to drive on the test course, and circles a roundabout repeatedly. As Mrs. Puff is watching a soap opera, Headlocks & Heartbreaks, on her TV, SpongeBob drives off the boating course and onto a highway, which is in the direction of downtown Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob proceeds to drive the boat through a playground and the Bikini Bottom Jail while attempting to follow Mrs. Puff's instructions.Mrs. Puff chokes on popcorn while using her walkie-talkie, and SpongeBob's walkie-talkie is bumped, resulting in the signal switching to the one used for alerts about traffic violations. SpongeBob sees a child drive past a stop sign and sets off his siren, and chases him downtown while the bikers from earlier are on his tail. While on his chase, SpongeBob takes a detour; the kid and the bikers are unable to make the turn, and end up driving into the Dynamite Factory (which explodes on impact). A Bikini Bottom News Flash interrupts Headlocks & Heartbreaks, alerting Mrs. Puff about SpongeBob's reckless driving. Mrs. Puff looks out her window, and realizes that Bikini Bottom is in a state of disaster. She attempts to get SpongeBob's attention through her walkie-talkie, but is unable to, so she sets off her lighthouse cannon and blasts herself towards downtown.Mrs. Puff takes control of a fish's motorcycle and goes ahead of SpongeBob, urging him to turn around. SpongeBob successfully does this, but soon crashes into the bikers, resulting in Potato Puff being mashed. SpongeBob cries, still assuming that Mrs. Puff is the potato, but the actual Mrs. Puff soon shows up in front of him. SpongeBob is glad that Mrs. Puff is still alive, as she reassures him of her duty. The bikers approach SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff, asking her for an autograph due to her heroics. However, the police soon show up; the bikers bail, while Mrs. Puff is arrested. The episode ends with Mrs. Puff in jail, peeling potatoes next to the disguised one she used earlier in the episode.",Potato Puff,"[The episode begins with a baby walking around a crib in a nursery, being filmed by Incidentals 6 and 47, who cheer it on. SpongeBob crashes the boat through a wall in the nursery. The boat goes around in a circle around the crib.]
SpongeBob: I can't see! I can't see! [Incidentals 6 and 47 both scream as the boat is about to drive into them]
Baby: [spits out pacifier] Mama! Papa! No!
[The baby grows muscular legs as it takes its parents with it as it leaps through the roof of the building, and takes them with it, running. SpongeBob drives the boat out of the building and drives into the distance, toppling down a building. It cuts to the Dynamite Factory, where the mayor is about to cut the red ribbon to the entrance. A large growd has gathered around it.]
Ms. Mayor: Bikini Bottom's long-awaited Dynamite Factory is now open!
Mrs. Puff: [off-screen] Look out!
Ms. Mayor: Huh?
[The boat drives into the ribbon, flinging it into the air.]
SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff: Whoa! [the boat stops mid-air] Phew. [scream as the boat falls down]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mrs. Puff, I can see your house from up here. [the boat crashes into Mrs. Puff's house. Mrs. Puff inflates and floats to her bed]
Mrs. Puff: [sighs] Look at that, you saved me a commute. Just let yourself out.
SpongeBob: Well, if you're sure. [his face pops out, and his bike appears] [riding the bike out of the house] See you tomorrow, Mrs. Puff! La-la-la-la-la! [door shuts, and a picture frame falls off]
Mrs. Puff: Maybe he really is unteachable. [deflates] I give up. No, Puff, not yet. You're a driving instructor! Instructing that boy is your duty. You just need a little guidance. [grabs the phone]
[On top of a cliff, a guru is meditating. His phone rings, and picks it up.]
Guru: The universe greets you. Allow me to guide your celestial vessel.
Mrs. Puff: [yelling] SpongeBob... driving... [inflates] me... [shouting] crazy!
Guru: [gets pushed off the cliff, but hangs onto the edge] Oh, Mrs. Puff. Perhaps it would help if you find a way to be with SpongeBob without being with SpongeBob, hmm? Okay, feel free to annoy me for money again soon. Goodbye. [throws his phone into the distance, and it explodes] Ah, less stress.
[Bubble transition to Mrs. Puff's Boating School, where Mrs. Puff walks to.]
Mrs. Puff: Being with SpongeBob without being with SpongeBob. But how? [inflates and deflates, calming herself. She then hears music] Huh? Where is that music coming from? [she looks above to see a submarine] A submarine? [looking at camera] That gives me an idea.
[Mrs. Puff hops behind a rock and comes out with a ski mask. She uses a grappling hook to bring herself to one of the submarine's windows. She sees the French Narrator peeling potatoes.]
French Narrator: [singing while peeling] La da dee, la da doo, la da dum...
Mrs. Puff: I knew it! Where there are sailors, there are always potatoes.
[The French Narrator changes the radio to stealth music.]
[Mrs. Puff looks left and right, then pulls out a cutter that says ""Lil' Sharpy Glass Cutter."" She uses it to cut a circular hole in the glass and jumps through it. Hanging on via a grappling hook, she grabs a potato and makes her way out of the submarine. This causes water to spew out, confusing the French Narrator.]
French Narrator: Huh? Qu'est-ce que c'est?
[Bubble transition to Mrs. Puff with a potato seatbelt fastened in her boat. She puts lipstick on the potato and puts her hair and hat on top of it.]
Mrs. Puff: There. That should do it.
SpongeBob: La-la-la-la-la!
Mrs. Puff: [notices SpongeBob] Huh? Gah! [runs into the lighthouse and shuts the door]
SpongeBob: [hops into the driver's seat] Oh, Mrs. Puff! It's been so [hugs the potato] long! Did you miss me?
Mrs. Puff: [via pager] Oh, yes, SpongeBob. I missed you so much. It's so good [cut to her at the lighthouse holding the pager] to see you. From here.
SpongeBob: Ooh, did you get a new hat? It really brings out all your eyes. [cut to a closeup of the potato eyes. SpongeBob laughs. The camera pans back to the lighthouse]
Mrs. Puff: Alright, time to focus on the road, my excellent little noodle.
SpongeBob: Ooh, [saluting] I must live up to your noodle-pectations! [backs up the boat and drives away. He passes the start line] How was that?
Mrs. Puff: That was very good.
[SpongeBob approaches a roundabout and circles around the rock in a clockwise direction.]
Mrs. Puff: [from pager] Okay, take a right here. [SpongeBob continues to drive in circles] Now, keep going right.
SpongeBob: [elbow bumps the potato twice] Feels right to me! [laughs]
Mrs. Puff: [at her house wearing a wig] Ah, yes it does. [going to her chair with popcorn] Now I can catch up with my stories. [turns on the TV]
Sardina Sardiña: Oh, Dwayne. The only thing I've ever loved... [bell rings to reveal a wrestling ring as she lifts Dwayne up] is a skull-cracking smackdown! [slams Dwayne to the floor, and jumps on him]
Mrs. Puff: [pumped up] That's right!
SpongeBob: [on pager] Keep going right? [cut back to him still going right] All right.
Mrs. Puff: [on pager] Um, yeah. Sure, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Boy, I really feel like I'm getting the hang of this turning-right thing. Hey, this is the longest I've ever driven without crashing.
Mrs. Puff: [cuts back to her reaching for more popcorn, but realizing she's out] Huh? Oh. There's none left.
[Cutting back to SpongeBob, the word ""left"" echoes in his mind as he looks around.]
SpongeBob: Left? But I'm still working on right. [looking at the traffic ahead] Do you really think I'm ready?
Mrs. Puff: [cuts back to her headbanging the TV] Yeah!
SpongeBob: [cuts back to him] Oh, okay, if you think so.
[SpongeBob turns the steering wheel left, and the boat breaks through the barbed fence, and breaking both the signs. He gets onto the road, and the potato's wig falls off.]
SpongeBob: Oh! [chuckles as he puts the potato's wig back on] Sorry about that. [screams as he runs into a biker]
Biker: Huh, some people will do anything to use the carpool lane. [goes up an elevated road] Huh? Uh oh. [breaks through a barrier at the end of the road, and gets launched into the air, crashing into the ground and causing an explosion]
[A popcorn bag pops in Mrs. Puff's microwave, which beeps. She pours the popcorn into a bowl, reclines her chair, and goes back to watching TV. She starts eating her popcorn, and has a realization.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, uh, [taking into pager] SpongeBob? Your driving is immaculate. Just keep turning right.
SpongeBob: [on pager] Oh, I'm great at that.
[Children are playing on a playground at the park, when SpongeBob drives through, catching the boat on the swing. The children all run away, screaming. SpongeBob is released from the swing and spins in the roundabout. Then, he ramps up the slide and lands behind Bikini Bottom Jail.]
Mrs. Puff: [on pager] Keep that righty nice and tight-y.
SpongeBob: Tightening my rightening. [turns right, breaking into the jail, causing an alarm to go off]
[Some prisoners hang onto SpongeBob's boat as he drives out, and SpongeBob laughs. Several jail wardens and prisoners come out of each hole. The prisoner cheers as SpongeBob keeps driving.]
Mrs. Puff: [eating popcorn] This is the most fulfilling day I've ever had as a teacher. Mmm. [chokes on popcorn]
[SpongeBob stops driving at a red light. He hears Mrs. Puff choking]
SpongeBob: Uh oh. Swallowed a bug, huh? [pats the potato]
Pager: [changing to a different channel] Attention all units, major traffic violations in progress. [SpongeBob gasps] Please pursue as fast as possible.
[A kid on a bicycle slaps the stop sign as he drives past it.]
SpongeBob: [gasps, and puts on a determined face as he puts on a student driver siren on the boat] This must be an advanced lesson. [accelerates, pursuing the child]
Child: Huh? [pedals past a saloon, where several bikers are]
Biker: [in a full body cast] Hey, [pointing] that's him, the jerk with the spud! [accelerates his wheelchair as the others follow] Let's get him, boys!
Child: [scared] Ooh! [siren wails as SpongeBob chases him, who is being chased by the bikers]
[The child pedals his way down a road, and SpongeBob soon follows, swerving past a pedestrian and two others. The bikers follow. Rube is then seen as a tour guide at the Dynamite Factory. The baby (along with its two parents) are observing.]
Rube: This historic dynamite factory has been open for one entire day with no accidents. Isn't that amazing?
Mother: [notices the siren wailing] Huh?
[The three parties are all on the road, and SpongeBob hits a hole in the road.]
Pager: Breaker, breaker, Cabin Boy. Hard to port.
SpongeBob: Oh, a 10-4, Mrs. Puff! [turns left, while the others do not]
[The bikers head towards the Dynamite Factory, and scream, along with the tourists and Rube. The baby spits out its pacifier.]
Baby: I'm gettin' too old for this. [carries the tourists and Rube and runs away]
[Off-screen, the bikers crash into the dynamite factory, causing a massive explosion behind SpongeBob, who puts on a pair of sunglasses. Cut back to Mrs. Puff watching TV, when it is interrupted by a news flash.]
Reporter: We interrupt Headlocks and Heartbreaks with an emergency news bulletin. [Mrs. Puff looks at the TV, the popcorn bowl popping off her head] [footage of SpongeBob driving from earlier is shown] High-speed sponge terrorizes Bikini Bottom with potato prisoner, last seen pursued by band of bandit bikers along Kraken Avenue. Who knows where he may strike next? [SpongeBob drives into the camera, and the TV goes to static]
Mrs. Puff: [gasps, and looks out her window to see the town on fire, exploding]
Fred: My leg! [a helicopter then explodes]
Mrs. Puff: [using pager] Uh, SpongeBob? Gah! [panicking] Hello? Hello? Oh, Neptune. [takes off her wig] Enough of this leisure wig. Time for [puts on a lime green mohawk] the pursuit wig! [rips off her clothes to reveal a wrestling outfit, and pulls a lever]
[The lighthouse turns into a cannon and shoots Mrs. Puff into downtown Bikini Bottom. Cut to a first-person perspective of a biker, where SpongeBob is still driving. Mrs. Puff lands on top of the bike.]
Mrs. Puff: I'm a driving instructor, and I'm commandeering this vehicle!
Biker: I can dig it, mohawk mama. [gets crushed by Mrs. Puff as she accelerates on the bike]
[Mrs. Puff stops in front of SpongeBob, who is oblivious.]
Mrs. Puff: [screams then uses pager] Turn around!
SpongeBob: Ooh, whatever you say! [turns the boat around, and just barely misses Mrs. Puff as he starts driving in the other direction, laughing]
Mrs. Puff: [wiping off sweat] Phew. [notices that SpongeBob is running directly into the bikers] Oh, dear.
[A crash occurs, and the potato flies into the air, its accessories falling off. It gets peeled by a wheel, cooked by the flames, sliced into pieces by tire spokes, and turns into mashed potatoes when it hits a building. It slides down and lands on the ground. A gravy truck falls down, and gravy spews out, covering the mashed potatoes in gravy. Mrs. Puff's wig and hat land on top of it.]
SpongeBob: [face planted from the crash, gets up, and sees the mashed potatoes, gasps and screams] Mrs. Puff! You've been mashed! [cries, and uses his eyes as tissues to blow his nose then puts his eyes back in, which turn into geysers of tears]
Mrs. Puff: [returns, taking back her hat and wig] Ahem.
SpongeBob: Huh? [hugs Mrs. Puff] She's alive! Oh, you sure are resilient, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: From now on, SpongeBob, I'll uphold my duty as your driving instructor [hugging SpongeBob] to keep you safe on the road.
[The bikers from earlier, now all injured, approach them, growling. A tooth breaks off of the main biker's mouth.]
Biker: [gasps] Wait a minute! You're Puff the Tuff! Will you sign my cast?
Another biker: Aww.
Other biker: I love you!
Squid biker: What a legend!
Mrs. Puff: [blushing] Oh, hi, boys.
[Several cop cars surround them all, sirens wailing.]
Biker: [panicked] Looks like you got things under control her. Let's scram! [the bikers all run away]
Mrs. Puff: [hands held out] [sighs] I know the drill. [a police officer puts handcuffs on her]
[Bubble transition to Mrs. Puff in her jail cell in a prisoner outfit, peeling potatoes. The potato from earlier is seen next to her, also in a prisoner outfit and with a bandage.]
Mrs. Puff: So, what are you in for? [sighs]",0.44,Danny Giovannini

An announcer introduces the Goofy Scoopers, and SpongeBob and Patrick cheer for their appearance. They play the Goober Rag, with all the kids falling asleep and plugging their ears. The manager then tells SpongeBob and Patrick to leave. They get kicked out and want to go backstage for an autograph, with Patrick showing off his autographs on the back of his head.The next morning, the manager tells SpongeBob and Patrick that the Goofy Scoopers are over, and they are replaced by DJ 2 Sc00pz.

[The ice cream falls on the manager. Patrick eats the ice cream off the manager's head.]
SpongeBob: [laughs and cheers]
Patrick: I'll take another one, this time with less manager.
[The manager shudders in anger.]
Goofy Goober VA: Attention, children of all ages!
[Cue a close-up of a stage, as the spotlight moves around. SpongeBob and Patrick rock back and forth in excitement, while the other kids look bored.]
SpongeBob: Hello, hi!
Patrick: Hey, that's me!
SpongeBob: I love you, I love you!
Patrick: [laughs] All ages, yay!
[The curtains open to reveal three limp-looking robots: a green octopus at a piano, a bear at a set of drums with a ""GS"" logo, and a bipedal clam wearing sunglasses.]
Goofy Goober VA: Put your fins together for the cool cat on the drum kit, Bongos Bear!
[Bongos beats the drums, then a cymbal, then hits himself on the head.]
Goofy Goober VA: On trumpet, this bivalve really swings. Clem Clam!
[Clem plays the trumpet, then takes off his sunglasses and winks.]
Goofy Goober VA: You know him, you love him. Eight tentacles on eighty-eight keys. It's Rock T. Puss!
[Rock plays the 88-key piano, sometimes stopping and spinning his head rapidly.]
Goofy Goober VA: That's our combo! Give it up for The Goofy Scoopers!
[The curtains in back part, revealing a ""Goofy Scoopers"" logo. Rock begins singing as Bongos and Clem play their instruments.
Rock: [singing] ♪A one and two and three and four, I need more scoops, ice cream galore, or I'll banana split right out that door. Don't you know, I'm doing the Goober Rag!♪
[SpongeBob and Patrick cheer for Rock. SpongeBob wears ""GG""-shaped glasses and sticks his tongue out, and Patrick wears a ""GG"" shirt. The rest of the kids look bored.]
SpongeBob: [ululating] I love you!
Patrick: [throws his pants at Rock's face] I love you, Rock T. Puss!
Rock: [singing] ♪Oh, five and six and seven and eight, finish my ice cream, licking my plate!♪
[Two kids are seen sitting at a table, looking bored. One falls over sideways, and the other collapses into her ice cream.]
Rock: [singing] ♪Another fudge sundae sure sounds great!♪
[A girl is seen reading a book called Taxes 4 Kids! , while a boy watches an hourglass.]
Rock: [singing] ♪And that is how I do that Goober Rag!♪
[Another girl has a sleep mask on and has fallen asleep, while another boy relaxes with headphones on. A fat kid fish shoves ice cream bowls into his ears. SpongeBob and Patrick stomp their feet as the rest of the kids get annoyed and leave the restaurant.]
Rock: [singing] ♪Nine and ten and eleven and twelve, get the rum raisin off that shelf! I'll eat the whole tub all on my own, and I don't even need a cone! Don't you know, that's how? Can't you see, I'm doing it now? I'm coming, I'm going, I'm doing the Goober Rag!♪
[The robots short-circuit with a burst of smoke, and shut down. The lights go off and the curtains close.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [cheering] Alright! / Woo! / Yeah, yeah!
[The Goofy Manager walks up to them.]
Goofy Manager: All right, boys, time to go.
Patrick: You can't kick us out. We've been coming here since we were [throws table] kids!
SpongeBob: Yeah, we're the Goofy Scoopers' biggest fans!
Goofy Manager: [throws his hands up] Well, that's your problem. [points to his watch] Closing time!
[SpongeBob and Patrick begin crying and grab onto the manager's feet.]
Goofy Manager: You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are kicked out of the restaurant.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa!
Patrick: This stinks. I wanted to go backstage for an autograph.
[Patrick turns around, revealing some text written on the back of his head: signatures from SpongeBob and Sandy, blue writing that says ""Mom xoxo,"" small green text that says ""Plankton wuz here,"" and a parking ticket with a $30.00 charge.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick. We'll just come back and see the Goofy Scoopers tomorrow!
[Close-up of Patrick's face, where ""Zee French Narrator"" is written on his head and eyelids. A rooster crows as a time card is shown.]
French Narrator: Zee next morning...
[The Goofy Manager is in front of Goofy Goober's, looking through some keys on a ring.]
SpongeBob: [leaning in] Good morning!
Goofy Manager: [screams, scared] I don't carry cash! [freezes, then opens his eyes] Huh?
[SpongeBob and Patrick are wearing peanut sleeping bags, in front of a tent and burnt-out campfire.]
Goofy Manager: [disappointed] It's you two.
Patrick: We camped out all night to see the Gooey Sneakers.
SpongeBob: Goofy Scoopers. [steps out of sleeping bag]
Patrick: Yeah, them! [pokes head, making a hollow sound] They're gonna write on my head!
Goofy Manager: [sneaky] Well... about that...
[SpongeBob and the manager go inside. Patrick doesn't move, and SpongeBob drags him and his sleeping bag inside.]
Goofy Manager: The Goofy Scoopers are over. Too old fashioned. The kids want a new sound.
SpongeBob and Patrick: A new sound !?
Goofy Manager: [gestures to stage] That's right, I brought in an act you're going to flip over!
[The curtains open, revealing a robot of an ice cream cone wearing sunglasses, headphones, and a backwards cap. He stands at a stereo with a laptop on it and an insignia with two ice cream cones, labeled ""2"" and ""S"", on the side.]
Goofy Manager: Say hello to... DJ 2 Sc00pz!
[DJ 2 Sc00pz presses a button on his laptop. The background behind the stage shows a techno tunnel as EDM music plays. Kids run up and start dancing.]
SpongeBob: [covering his ears] Sorry, but the Goofy Scoopers are the only ice cream themed musical robot act [folds his arms] we'll ever love.
[SpongeBob opens his eyes to see Patrick dancing to DJ 2 Sc00pz's music.
Patrick: [rhythmic grunting]
SpongeBob: Patrick, don't give in to its seductive [imitates a robot] womp-womps and wub-wubs. Please, Mr. Manager, you have to tell us where the Scoopers are! [a thought bubble appears, growing and changing with each location listed] Are they playing at a coffee house? Are they playing the Bikini Bottom Bowl? Or on a world tour?
Goofy Manager: No! [waves the thought bubble away] Oh, my, no. [points behind him] I threw those old robots in the garbage. They're never playing anywhere again.
[SpongeBob and Patrick cry, and the kids dance next to them instead. A kid slides on his stomach through a puddle of their tears.]
Goofy Manager: [grabs a broom] All right, you're killing the atmosphere in here. Please do all your crying outside.
[The manager pushes the crying SpongeBob and Patrick through the back door, next to the dumpsters.]
SpongeBob: [stops crying] Wait a minute, Patrick. I have a plan! We can stop crying.
Patrick: Well, I wasn't crying. I was just... [his head has a handle on it, which he flushes] flushing my eyes.
[Patrick's tears drain out of his eyes and pour into his mouth.]
Patrick: You were saying?
SpongeBob: We are gonna get the Goofy Scoopers back together for a reunion show. [paces around] Then everyone will remember how great they were.
[SpongeBob starts pacing around the edges of the screen. Patrick elongates his neck to follow him.]
Patrick: But we don't know where they are.
SpongeBob: True, but we do know how they got to where they were... [steps to garbage] before they went wherever they are!
[Patrick's stretched neck snaps back to his body. SpongeBob gestures to the dumpster and two bags of trash outside.]
SpongeBob: Hmm? Hmm? [grins at Patrick] Ah!
Patrick: I'm confused, but I appreciate your confidence. Count me in! [head slides backwards and falls off] Ow!
[Cut to a time card.]
French Narrator: Later...
[A garbage truck pulls up to a box and a trash bag with a cone on it. The garbage fish shrugs and picks up the box, but the truck drives off.]
Garbage man: Huh?
SpongeBob: [driving away] Sorry about borrowing your truck!
[Patrick sticks his head out through the window, with his tongue out.]
SpongeBob: We have to save some robots from the trash so our favorite band can get back together! I'm sure you understand!
Garbage man: [shrugs] Eh, that sounds reasonable.
[Bubble transition to the Dump. The garbage truck is crashed outside. SpongeBob and Patrick are searching through a pile of junk.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [grunting]
[A man runs up to them and yells.]
Dump worker: Hey, what you boys doing to my precious junk?
SpongeBob: Sorry, sir. I was just looking for some robot musicians!
Patrick: And I was looking for food. [pulls out an old boot in a diaper] You gonna eat this hot dog? [gets pushed away by trash]
Dump worker: Well, I don't know nothing about music-men, but I do remember one [points] robot fella coming through here. Nice guy. [points behind him] Sold him to the circus for about $3.50.
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's our first clue! We gotta get to the circus! [steps off-screen]
[Patrick emerges from a pile of trash, holding the diaper and some glue.]
Patrick: Great, 'cause I just found the mayo!
[He pours the glue on the diaper and eats it, then runs off. Filthy Muck walks by, but gets scared away by the dump worker, who chases him.]
Dump worker: Hey, what are you doing in my precious junkyard?
[SpongeBob and Patrick run to the circus, look around a bit, and SpongeBob points at Clem.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's Clem Clam!
Patrick: [pounds his fists] Let's get him!
SpongeBob: W-w-wait, Patrick. We're here to make friends with him, don't you remember?
Patrick: Obviously, I do not.
SpongeBob: [rubbing his chin] How are we gonna get him to play the show? [gets an idea] I got it! We'll appeal to his intellect with sound reasoning and convincing arguments!
'[SpongeBob and Patrick grovel and beg in front of Clem, who is inflating balloons.]
SpongeBob: [crying] Please!
Patrick: [crying] We need you!
SpongeBob: [crying] You gotta come back, you just gotta!
Clem: [ties balloon] You can cool it, cats. Whatever your scheme is, I'm in. [gives balloon to SpongeBob] Just get me out of this crazy circus. I'm terrified of clowns, man.
[A circus tent opens, revealing a clown with a yellow eyes and an evil smile, as honking and evil laughter is heard. Clem shudders.]
SpongeBob: Well, that's great, Mr. Clem Clam, because tomorrow night, [puts his hand around Patrick] we're getting the band back together. Reunion show tomorrow night at Goofy Goober's. So far, you're the only one we've found, though.
Clem: You know, the circus's least flexible contortionist saw Bongos Bear [points right] at that massage place downtown, man.
[A fish with an arched back walks past.]
Contortionist: It's true -- ow...
SpongeBob: Great! Come on, Patrick. I feel another plan forming.
[They skip off together, laughing.]
Clem: Wait, take me with you, man!
[The clown appears behind an oxygen tank and pops a balloon, causing Clem to jump.]
Clown: [evil laughter]
Clem: Aah!
[The clown leaves, accompanied by honking.]
Clem: [dismayed] Ugh...
[Cut to the outside of a massage parlor. Inside, Bongos stands at two tables. SpongeBob enters, dressed like a man with a mustache, hair, and green suit. Patrick accompanies him, wearing a blouse, pearls, and lipstick.]
SpongeBob: [disguising voice] Uh, yes, my wife and I are here for the [raises eyebrows] couples massage.
Patrick: [womanly giggling]
SpongeBob: [disguising voice] Say... aren't you Bongos Bear from the Goofy Scoopers?
Bongos: Son, you got the wrong robot bear. I don't even like music. I just give massages.
Patrick: [womanly voice] Don't forget to work my glutes!
[Bongos shudders. SpongeBob and Patrick jump onto the tables. Bongos hits them, creating a rhythm, as SpongeBob and Patrick begin grunting. A bongo rhythm plays.]
Bongos: All right, all right, you win! [takes out xylophone mallets and keeps playing] I am Bongos Bear. And I got music in my cold, robotic heart.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [disguises rip off] Yay!
SpongeBob: Well, you're in luck, 'cause Patrick and I are getting your band back together.
Patrick: Yeah, but we still gotta find the piano octopus.
Bongos: [shrugs] Oh, that's easy. A construction worker with [points to his back] lumbago told me Rock is working on the bridge to Shell City now.
[A construction worker, leaned over and holding his back, walks past.]
Construction worker: It's true -- ow...
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick walking on a green, mechanical bridge. Drivers swerve to avoid them.]
Patrick: [calling] Rock?
SpongeBob: [calling] Rock T. Puss?
Patrick: [calling] Rock T. Puss?
SpongeBob: [calling] Rock T. Puss? Rock T. Puuuss?
Patrick: [calling] Where are you?
[Patrick kicks a rock, dodging a scared Fred, who drives past.]
Patrick: This stinks. Bongos lied. I don't see him anywhere!
[Patrick sulks. A green hand holding the bridge comes loose and slaps him.]
Patrick: Hey!
[An upwards shot reveals that the hand belongs to Rock, who is part of the bridge.]
Rock: Get out of here. I'm on the job.
SpongeBob: [excited] Rock T. Puss! [puts his hand around Patrick] We're SpongeBob and Patrick! [shakes himself and Patrick] We're your biggest fans!
Rock: Yeah, right. No one remembers my music.
Patrick: That's okay. I don't remember anything! [his pupils drift apart]
Rock: Look, kids, I'm a working robot now. The only bands I care about are the boats on this bridge. Their honking horns are the only applause I'll ever need again!
[A strange noise is heard.]
SpongeBob: Umm...
[Patrick rubs his stomach.]
Patrick: Oh, that was me. Sorry, I blame the hot dog.
SpongeBob: Oh, please, Mr. Puss. We're getting the Goofy Scoopers back together for a reunion show. We need you.
Rock: The answer is no! I'm a bridge now. [points left] Get out of here!
[SpongeBob and Patrick sadly whimper and walk away. Cut to the outside of Goofy Goober's, where many people have gathered outside. The camera zooms into an elevated stage at the front of the restaurant, where Patrick adjusts a microphone and SpongeBob plugs in a speaker. Clem and Bongos walk in.]
Clem: Hey, guys. Where's Rock?
Patrick: Oh, he's not coming.
Bongos: [bolts and screws fly out of him] Wha? Oh, I don't know if we can do this without Rock T. Puss.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, we'll be playing with ya! It'll be fun!
[Patrick takes some sheet music out of his pants.]
Patrick: Here's the new piece I wrote. We're gonna come in hot off the intro, so try to keep up.
[Clem takes the music, him and Bongos looking worried.]
Bongos: Huh...
[The lights go on. SpongeBob is seen strumming an electric guitar as loud feedback plays. Bongos gets ready at his drum set and plays rapidly. SpongeBob and Patrick come in, dressed like KISS members, as Patrick takes the microphone. Heavy rock music plays.]
Patrick: [singing rapidly] Ice cream, so tasty, freezing in my mouth!
[Rapid shots show the Goofy Scoopers struggling to keep up, Patrick singing intensely, and SpongeBob licking his guitar in front of a fire backdrop.]
Patrick: [singing rapidly] Icy pain inside my brain, won't you help me out!? I have a brain freeze, I have a brain freeze, I have a brain freeze, help me with my brain freeze!
[The song stops abruptly.]
Patrick: [calmly] Can I have another sundae, please?
[The audience boos and throws tomatoes.]
Clem: They are not digging it, man.
Patrick: We told you guys to keep up!
[Something catches their attention. They walk to the stage and look down, as the crowd parts. Rock walks through the crowd, and extends his body to reach the stage.]
Bongos: [laughs] Rock T. Puss, you came!
Rock: Sorry I left you hanging, guys. I did like being a bridge, but I was built to make music!
SpongeBob: Say, how is the bridge?
Rock: [shrugs] Eh, I'm sure its fine.
[Cut to the bridge, which has a big hole in the middle. Drivers scream and fall in, and then the bridge collapses, leading to a large explosion.]
Rock: Now, let's rock!
Bongos, Clem, SpongeBob, and Patrick: Yeah!
[Rock plays the piano, Bongos beats some drums, and Clem plays the trumpet. Rock slides his hand across the piano. The band plays ""Goober Rag"" as SpongeBob and Patrick dance and laugh.]
[The crowd boos and throws tomatoes again.]
SpongeBob: The kids still don't like it! What do we [squeezes himself] do?
[A hand grabs a tomato. It belongs to DJ 2 Sc00pz.]
SpongeBob: Huh?
DJ 2 Sc00pz: Maybe I can help with that. I'm DJ 2 Sc00pz, and I'm a huge Goofy Scoopers fan. [lowers his sunglasses] Care to jam?
[Rock slides his hand across the piano, leaving the keys he presses rainbow-colored. SpongeBob and Patrick stare in awe as DJ 2 Sc00pz plays an EDM remix of ""Goober Rag"" with the Goofy Scoopers. The characters are flat-colored, and the backgrounds change color.]
[Sequential close-ups show DJ 2 Sc00pz playing, SpongeBob and Patrick dancing, Bongos playing the drums, Clem on the trumpet, and Rock playing piano.]
[A zoom-out shows the Goofy Goober building with multicolored lights shining from it. The audience cheers loudly. The clown, construction worker, dump worker, contortionist, and Goofy Manager are seen dancing along. SpongeBob and Patrick crawl into the crowd and jump into the air.]
[Sequential close-ups show SpongeBob and Patrick jumping, smiling at each other, and dancing up and down. The Goofy Manager, sucking on a pacifier, waves his finger to the music. SpongeBob and Patrick press against him, to his surprise.]
[SpongeBob and Patrick dance in the audience, as Goofy Goober spins past, waving glowsticks.]
[The restaurant itself begins moving and drives off into the distance, as fireworks explode in the air.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Best Goofy Scoopers show ever!
[They jump into the air and high-five, as the rest of the crowd walks away. The camera zooms in on Patrick's head, which has ""The End"" written on it. The screen cuts to this same text written in white against a black background.]",0.42,Andrew Goodman

Karen cherishes this date as one to remember. To continue to impress Karen, Plankton dresses up as Ray Ray. Just as Plankton and Karen are about to kiss, Plankton notices Mr. Krabs driving away in his boat, leaving the Krabby Patty formula behind. Plankton interrupts his kiss with Karen as he drops down to steal the formula. However, his hands go right through the formula, unable to touch it. The formula soon disappears, as it is revealed that he was under a simulation at the Chum Bucket run by Karen.Karen gets angry at Plankton for always interrupting their dates. Plankton tries to explain himself, attempting to get the formula for both of them, but Karen places the Chum Bucket on lockdown unless Plankton can prove his romance towards her without interruptions. On the next date, Plankton cooks up stew for Karen. He soon peeks at the Krusty Krab, seeing Mr. Krabs drive away without the formula again. Plankton tries to unscrew a window to go after the formula, but Karen soon notices him, with Plankton explaining that he was finishing up the stew and throws the screw into the pot.Looking outside, Plankton notices Patrick running by the Krusty Krab. Plankton uses a microphone to get his attention, attempting to make him grab the formula. Patrick eventually does grab the formula, but Plankton soon notices he is gone. Patrick ends up randomly appearing in the Chum Bucket, having brought in the wrong bottle. Plankton, again looking outside, notices the formula roll towards the Chum Bucket while Larry, SpongeBob, and a few others exercise. Karen asks Plankton about her dinner, as he replies that it is almost ready. Plankton then gets the idea of disguising Patrick as Ray Ray, sawing Patrick to his size and shape and placing a microphone in his tooth.Patrick, as Ray Ray, gives Karen her dinner. Meanwhile, Plankton uses a lighter to reveal a way out the Chum Bucket. Patrick bites Karen's wheels, while Plankton gets him to massage them. Soon after, Mr. Krabs notices the formula is gone, so he makes his way towards the Krusty Krab. He goes crazy at the Krusty Krab trying to look for it, before realizing it might be with Plankton. He tries to enter the Chum Bucket, as Plankton continues to light his way out. Karen notices the noise, but Plankton manages to distract her again. Plankton finally lights his way out as he tries to get the formula into the Chum Bucket, but he can't fit the bottle through the hole. Mr. Krabs notices Plankton, attempting to grab it from him.Karen compliments Plankton, saying that she was so impressed with the date that she has uploaded the formula inside her. Plankton decides to let go of the formula as he goes towards Karen. Just as Karen is about to reveal the formula, Plankton anxiously asks for it, angering her. Plankton and Patrick argue over them both being Ray Ray as Karen deletes her copy of the formula. Plankton and Karen go on another date on a hot-air balloon, with Plankton chained to his seat and the table and Patrick horribly playing the violin. Plankton groans as the episode ends.",Lockdown for Love,"[The episode starts at the Chum Bucket, of which the bucket's handle falls to the ground, and Plankton and Karen are come out of it with a hot air balloon shaped like a heart for a date.]
Karen: Ah, I'm floating on air! A balloon ride, a candle-light dinner, and our wedding song is playing! This day is perfect.
Plankton: No, you're perfect, Karen. You're the best computer wife a copepod could ever have! [types on keyboard] Bon-bon? [he presses a button on the keyboard]
Karen: Oh, I shouldn't. [her computer screen turns into a woman eating a bon-bon]
Plankton: Indulge yourself, my darling.
Karen: Thank you, Plankton. This is truly a date to remember.
Plankton: Well, my love, you haven't seen anything yet. [comes back dressed as Ray Ray] For you, my love! [passes a rose to Karen using his tongue]
Karen: Oh, Ray Ray! [laughs and sniffs rose] Aah.
Plankton: [combs hair] That's right, baby. Ray Ray is at your service. [shines teeth]
Karen: Ray Ray, you've got my cooling fans running on high. [grabs Plankton and knocks down table] Ha, ha. Get over here and give me some sugar! [as Plankton and Karen are about to kiss, Plankton sees Mr. Krabs down from above.]
Plankton: Huh?
Mr. Krabs: ♪Do do do do do♪ [places the formula on top of his boat, and yawns and stretches] What a long day. [he gets in his boat as he leaves the formula behind]
Plankton: [looks down at the formula] [angelic singing] Uh... eh... ehh! Ahhh! I can't take it!
Karen: What is it, Plankton?
Plankton: Hold that thought, baby. I uh- I forgot something down here. I'll be right back! [jumps off from the balloon and his clothes fall off] Can't believe this is really happening. [falls to the ground] The Krabby Patty secret formula is finally mine! Huh? [He goes through the formula; every time he touches it, his hand goes through the formula] Huh? Eh... [The formula disappears] Ehh! [looks for the formula] Hm, eh, ah, eh, eh! Is this some kind of horrible nightmare? What? [the scene cuts to inside the Chum Bucket to reveal that Plankton was on top of a green screen] A projector? You tricked me with a simulation?!
Karen: It was a test, Plankton! And you failed! You fail every time when it comes to our romance.
Plankton: Right, so I goof up one time and now I'm the bad guy?
Karen: One time? Failed one time? [Numbers show up on her screen] How about 4,700,000 and- [glitching] Error, er-er-error.
Plankton: But baby cakes, I left to go get the Krabby Patty secret formula. For me... and you... You know... for us! [puts on a cute face] Ehhh?
Karen: Listen, Sheldon. You need to show me an interruption-free romantic date night because until that happens, no one is leaving the Chum Bucket. [presses an alarm that makes the Chum Bucket go on lockdown]
Plankton: Aah! [a brick wall crushes the front doors as the Chum Bucket's glove grabs some tinfoil as it places it on top of the roof and puts a rubber band on it.] [Karen grabs Plankton, and his Ray Ray clothes get put on] Oof!
Karen: You better not mess this one up, Ray Ray. [flicks Plankton off her hand]
Plankton: Ah! [bubble transition cuts to the next scene, where he is making a stew] ♪Da da da da doo doo♪ I think Karen's favorite ""scrap electronics stew"" ought to do the trick. [laughing] Yep. Huh? [notices that there is a window] I guess it wouldn't hurt to have just a little peek at the Krusy Krab. [climbs on the window] Hmm. [puts on a binocular]
Mr. Krabs: ♪Dee dee doo dee♪ What a long day. [yawns and stretches again; he gets in his boat and leaves the formula behind again.]
Plankton: [gasps] It's really out there! And this time it's not a hologram! [scratching the window and whimpering] [gets a screwdriver to untwist one of the nails attached to the window.] Uh, uh..
Karen: [clears throat] Plankton! What are you doing?
Plankton: Oh, hey, baby! Just adding the finishing touches to tonight's main course!
Karen: Aww, you are so sweet! I can't wait to try it! [Plankton kisses her screen]
Plankton: Whew! Good one, Plankton. The formula! [puts the binocular back on] Now how am I gonna get you? [breeze blows as the formula rolls to the Chum Bucket.] Yes, yes, yes! [boat runs over the formula] No, no, no! Slow it down, you maniac! [panting] Who's that?
Patrick: Krabby Patty! Krabby Patty!
Plankton: Eesh. It's that numbskull, Patrick. [gets a microphone] Hey, doofus! I mean, star friend.
Patrick: Krabby Patty. [he stops]
Plankton: Over here.
Patrick: Hmm?
Plankton: No, over here! Come on. [Patrick finally looks at the Chum Bucket] Yes, that's it. You've got it. Now who's a good boy? [Patrick starts panting] Okay, now grab that bottle by your feet there. [Patrick grabs a drink container] No. [sighs] The other drink container by your feet.
Patrick: Hmmm.
Plankton: Pick that one up instead.
Patrick: [looks at the Krusty Krab] Uh?
Plankton: By your feet.
Patrick: Huh? Uh?
Plankton: Now look right!
Patrick: Oh, huh! [drops his head into the ground]
Plankton: You have got to be kidding me. Right, Patrick!
Patrick: Uh?
Plankton: Your other right!
Patrick: Oh! [looks at formula]
Plankton: Yes! [laughs] That's it, huh!
Patrick: Ah! [picks up formula]
Plankton: Good boy. Now bring it over here to me. Yes, that's it! Huh? [he notices that Patrick is gone.] Oh, where did he go?! [sees Patrick in the Chum Bucket out of nowhere]
Patrick: Excuse me, are you the window cleaner?
Plankton: How in barnacles did you get in here?
Patrick: I don't know.
Plankton: Well, who cares? Did you bring that bottle I told you to bring?
Patrick: Uh-huh. [shows Plankton drink bottle] Tastes kind of funny, though. [drinks the bottle]
Plankton: No, I said the other one, you moron! [looks at the window as Larry is exercising with people]
Larry: Hey, you guys are doing great! [rolls the formula] Two, there, four! [the formula hits the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: A thin piece of glass is all that stands between me and what I want most in the world. Why is life so unfair?
Karen: Oh, honey? Is dinner almost ready? I'm famished!
Plankton: [he gets nervous] Uh, it's almost finished, my sweetheart! What am I gonna do? Think, Plankton, think! Oh? [pulls off his hair] Idea! [Plankton shows his hair at Patrick] That's it! Karen will never know the difference! Now I think I got what I need right here. [grabs a saw] Patrick, you may feel a slight tickle.
Patrick: Oh, I like tickles. [Plankton saws Patrick into his own shape]
Plankton: Okay, let's get a look at this.
Patrick: Ha, ha! That was intense!
Plankton: Oop! Almost forgot. [he tears off Patrick's right eye.]
Patrick: Ha, ha. Ow!
Plankton: [puts his Ray Ray clothes onto Patrick] You're going on a date with my wife Karen, Ray Ray.
Patrick: Oh, but I sound like Patrick.
Plankton: Oh, no. You keep your mouth shut. I will take care of that. [he puts a microphone in his tooth] [high-pitched feedback] [chuckles, and places Patrick with the soup onto the table] Oh, Karen? Dinner is served, my little love nugget!
Karen: Oh, my gosh. This looks amazing! I loves my Ray Ray. [growls and giggles]
Plankton: And I love my Karen. Now let's dig in! [Ray Ray known as Patrick puts the spoon in his mouth and chews it.]
Karen: [giggling] [bubble transition to the next scene.]
Plankton: [lights a lighter] Krabby Patty secret formula, here I come! [cuts the lighter into the wall]
Karen: Ow! That's a little rough, Ray Ray. [Patrick biting one of Karen's wheels] Ow, Plankton! What are you doing? [Plankton grabs Patrick's hands and has him massage Karen] Ohh. Oh, that feels nice. Ahh, okay. [lies back down] Goodnight.

As he launches towards the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob washes the restaurant while singing the ""F.U.N. Song."" The water from SpongeBob's hose sends Plankton falling into a sewer, landing on Bubble Bass's toothbrush after coming out of a faucet. Bubble Bass brushes his teeth, with Plankton still on his brush, before he spits into the sink, resulting in Plankton falling down the drain.Plankton lands at the bottom of the sewer as he attempts to make his way out, but shaking occurs soon after, revealing a sea gator. While Plankton whimpers, a large batch of chum scares the gator away. The chum reveals a group of C.H.U.M. (Collective Hive Under Master), who bow down and proclaim Plankton as their master. The C.H.U.M. leader says that they are created when Plankton flushes chum into the sewer, and the flushed chum mixes with sewer gases. The leader takes Plankton to their village, where he gets the idea of using the C.H.U.M. to help him steal the formula.Plankton trains the C.H.U.M. for infiltrating the Krusty Krab. He asks the C.H.U.M. to batter down doors in their first exercise, function as weaponry in the second, and utilize karate against cardboard cutouts of SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward in the third. Although being harmed in every exercise, Plankton exclaims the C.H.U.M. as ready, before the Mr. Krabs cardboard cutout falls on him.At the Krusty Krab, Plankton faces Mr. Krabs, as the C.H.U.M. army come out of the bathroom stalls. As the C.H.U.M. destroy the bathroom, they form a tank. The tank launches chum at Mr. Krabs, launching him towards the front window of the restaurant. He tries to ask SpongeBob for help, but he is too busy singing and playing with the hose to notice him. Mr. Krabs tries to hide from the C.H.U.M., as Plankton comes towards him on the tank, which soon forms a monster. Mr. Krabs continues trying to avoid them, but is soon caught.As the C.H.U.M. attacks him, Mr. Krabs pledges to give up the formula, but he soon notices SpongeBob and makes a run around the outside of the Krusty Krab. While the C.H.U.M. chases him down, SpongeBob notices a penny, spraying the hose behind him, which sends Plankton and the C.H.U.M. down the sewer. SpongeBob soon notices Mr. Krabs, who praises him for saving him. At the Chum Bucket, Plankton asks to hang out with the C.H.U.M., but they prefer living in the sewer, as they flush themselves down and the episode ends.",C.H.U.M.S,"[The episode begins with the camera panning on the Chum Bucket.]
Plankton: [chuckling while going inside the Chum Bucket glove. He puts on an analyzing helmet and analyzes The Krusty Krab] Very sloppy, Eugene, leaving an unprotected vent that leads right into your office! [chuckles and launches a plunger under the vent] Perfect! The secret formula is as good as mine! [chuckles and the plunger drags him] Yaaaaaaah! [crashes into the vent] Oof! I made it! Yes! [starts unscrewing a bolt]
SpongeBob: [the F.U.N. song starts playing on his headphones and splashes the windows with soap. He grabs the hose and it spins him around] Whoa, whoa! [Spraying the water to the soap in the letters] F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me! [Sprays water inside him and he inflates to the third window and sprays out water to make an N] N is for anywhere and anytime at all! [point the hose up]
Plankton: Eh? [the hose water splashes him and turns into a hand and slaps him.]
SpongeBob: Down here in the deep blue sea!
Plankton: [falls and tries to swim back up from the hose water but he falls into the sewer] Aah! [Plankton comes out of a faucet and lands on Bubble Bass' toothbrush] Ooh!
Bubble Bass' mom: Bubble Bass! Are you brushing your teeth?
Bubble Bass: Yes, mother! Ugh.
Plankton: [smells Bubble Bass' breath and gags, and Bubble Bass starts to brush his teeth] Oh, no.
[While Bubble Bass brushes his teeth, Plankton is grunting inside. Bubble Bass brushes his tongue, and his teeth and spits out. His teeth are then shiny.]
Plankton: [falls down the drain until he ends up in a sewer] Yuck! This place is filthier than the bathroom in my own fraternity house. Time to get outta here! [the sewer starts shaking] Aaah! Terrified, mind blank, possible wetting pants! Wait, I don't wear pants. Oh, lucky me! [an alligator appears behind him and Plankton whimpers until a group of chum scare it away] That's right, you better run! [looks behind him] Huh? [the C.H.U.M.S appear] Terror double!

Plankton: Me?
C.H.U.M. Leader: Yes! We are C.H.U.M.: Collective Hive Under Master! [bows down] You are master! You create us when you flush chum into sewer from your upside domain.
Plankton: You mean the Chum Bucket?
C.H.U.M. Leader: Yes! Chum mixes with gases in sewer... [a C.H.U.M. burps into a bucket of chum] ...to form we!
C.H.U.M. Baby: Goo, goo!
Plankton: Hmm. Makes sense! [Some C.H.U.M. surround him] In a stupid sort of way. [the C.H.U.M. form into a boat] Yee! Whoa! What's happening?
C.H.U.M. Leader: Master must come to village! [rows boat with a spork] So we may worship him!
Plankton: Well, I do love to be worshiped. [blinks twice] Hold on, how did you recognize me?
C.H.U.M Leader: From sacred scrapbook! [the scrapbook appears out of the C.H.U.M.'s body]
Plankton: Yah!
[A pipe decapitates the C.H.U.M. Leader's head. The neck grabs the head and puts it back on.]
C.H.U.M. Leader: We save all articles about master that float down here. Here review of Chum Bucket! You get one negative toilet. That must be highest rating possible.
Plankton: [chuckles nervously] Yep! That's the highest, alright! Let's just close that.
C.H.U.M.: [carries Plankton onto a chum throne]
Plankton: [removes the chum on him until the C.H.U.M.S carry him to the village. They lower him down and he slides into the C.H.U.M. Leader]
C.H.U.M. Leader: The master is pleased with our village?
Plankton: Uh, sure. Why not?
C.H.U.M. Leader: Oh, thank you, master! Thank you! [shakes Plankton's hands]
Plankton: That's enough of that! Do you have a napkin or something I can use to wipe my hands off?
C.H.U.M. Leader: A napkin for master!
Plankton: [while C.H.U.M.S offer him a napkin, he takes one] Thanks, but try to be a little faster next time. So you C.H.U.M. would really do anything for me?
C.H.U.M. Leader: Yes, yes! Whatever the master wishes! [squeezes Plankton until he launches up in the air]
Plankton: Hm, this gives me an idea! I don't need to steal the secret Krabby Patty formula by stealth! With you C.H.U.M. by my side, I can take it by force!
C.H.U.M Leader: Yes, yes! Whatever the master wishes!
Plankton: Ew. [pushes C.H.U.M. Leader] Alright, then! Line up for assault training! [laughs evilly, then bubble wipe to the next scene]
C.H.U.M.: [plays a fanfare]
Plankton: In order to successfully infiltrate The Krusty Krab, you'll need to batter some doors down! Now get to battering! [the C.H.U.M. form into a battering ram and batters the door] You call that battering? batter harder! [falls down the door] Wait, no, stop! [the C.H.U.M. runs over him and fully batters the door]
C.H.U.M. Leader: How was that, master?
Plankton: Heh.
[Bubble wipe to next scene.]
Plankton: In order for my plan to succeed, you will need to be experts marksmen. [clapping] Line up and form up! [the C.H.U.M. form into weaponry] Hold on, hold on, let me just put up this target before you fire.
C.H.U.M. Leader: Master say fire! [the C.H.U.M. start launching]
Plankton: Uh-oh! [Avoids every shot except for the third. He falls out]
C.H.U.M. Leader: How was our aim, master?
Plankton: [muffled] Eh, impeccable. [bubble wipe to the next scene] When we finally enter The Krusty Krab, you will face an enemy more evil than any of you can imagine! [The C.H.U.M.S. gasp when they see cardboard cut outs of SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward.]
Plankton: To get past Krabs and his vile cronies, and make it to the secret formula, you will need to be experts at the deadly art of Kah-Rah-Tay! [does karate at the cutouts] Now show master what you've got! [the C.H.U.M. form into a hand and smash the cutouts and Plankton] A+, you're ready. [Mr. Krabs cutout falls on Plankton. Bubble wipe to the next scene with Mr. Krabs washing his hands] Hello, Eugene.
Mr. Krabs: Plankton? Ah, get out of here before I flush you!
Plankton: The only thing getting flushed around here are your hopes of the Krabby Patty formula not being stolen by me!
Mr. Krabs: Ha! You and what army?
Plankton: Me and my C.H.U.M. army! [the C.H.U.M. starts coming out of the stalls]
Mr. Krabs: Plankton, what insanity is this?
Plankton: The insanity of genius!
Mr. Krabs: What's that chum doing?
Plankton: Anything I want it to do! [The C.H.U.M. form into a tank, then he chuckles] Oh, Krabs, you look a little hungry! Give him a taste, boys! [The tank launches chum at Mr. Krabs. He dodges them two times and holds himself upside down until the third chum hits the door and spins him. Another chum is fired and launches him to the window]
Mr. Krabs: [sees SpongeBob playing with the hose] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [falls over]
Mr. Krabs: [C.H.U.M. grabs his eyes and he pulls it out. He runs to hide in the cash register] You'll never get me formuler!

Mr. Krabs: [attacks the chum with a bag of flour, swings on the Order Here sign, and climbs to the top of wood]
Plankton: Sorry, Krabs, your aging acrobatics are no match for my C.H.U.M. monster!
Mr. Krabs: [swings on a rope] So long, sucker! [C.H.U.M. monster pulls on the rope] Oh, shrimp! [lands on a table which breaks and runs]
Plankton: Attack, my putrescent platoon!
Mr. Krabs: Eat splinters, ugly! [throws barrels at the monster then trips]
C.H.U.M. monster: [takes off its head to dodge the barrel and crushes the second and eat it then roars]
SpongeBob: [watering the ground until the hose stops spraying water. He peeks inside and it sprays water at him]
Plankton: This is your last chance Eugene! Give up the formula or else!
Mr. Krabs: Or else what?
Plankton: Or else this! [C.H.U.M. monster crushes the table]
Mr. Krabs: Alright, alright! I'll give you what you want! Just please don't hurt me. SpongeBob, help! [runs out of the Krusty Krab] SpongeBob! [puts a garbage bin behind the C.H.U.M. monster]

Squidward trips on his clarinet, rolling on it, and soon trips, sending him forward. He hits the door, making it flip rapidly, and throws him back the way he came from. He then falls down the stairs, lands on a chair, and bounces off. He grabs onto a chandelier and swings back and forth, hitting the ceiling multiple times. He gets injured and falls down, and puts his back against the wall. The fleas land on his head, disguised as a beret.]

Squidward: Why is this happening to me?
[The hand snaps its fingers, and points to the package Squidward left in the trash bin]
Squidward: Oh yeah. Karma. [the hand comes back to spray him with water] Ow! [he gets knocked into the oven]
[The sea fleas turn into an evil man]
Squidward: Hey, what are you-? [the man pours gravy onto him from a ladle, initially scaring him] Oh, that feels nice, and warm.
[The man turns a knob on the oven to the ""crisp"" setting, making Squidward sweat]
Squidward: It's actually getting kinda hot now. [vegetables are thrown into the oven] Hey, you're trying to cook me! Let me out of here! [his head bumps into the oven a few times before a hand shoves a parsnip into his mouth] Parsnip? [spits out the parsnip and gets out of the oven] Are you crazy?! You don't serve a prime piece of meat like me with parsnip. [gets out lemons] You need lemons to brighten my flavors, and some pepper [sprinkles pepper onto him] for spice. [jumps back into the oven. He then sips gravy from a spoon inside the oven] Ah, much better. Now let me out of here! [the oven door opens and Squidward pops out, screaming. The man turns back into a swarm of sea fleas, and follows Squidward. Squidward runs in circles.]

SpongeBob: Huh? [his buttons are dirty] Oh no, my buttons are tarnished. No circus flea is gonna wanna perform for a guy with tarnished buttons. [takes off the suit and shoves it through himself to clean it. He puts it back on, laughing. The sounds of a circus are heard] Circus music? [puts his hand up to his ear and sees that the noise is coming from Squidward's house] Hmm.
[SpongeBob runs over to Squidward's house and rings the doorbell. An injured Squidward opens the door. SpongeBob gasps.]
SpongeBob: Oh. [waves] Hey, Squidward. Uh, just checking. You haven't seen a package addressed to me, have you? [he gets a surprised look as he looks inside Squidward's house] Ooh? [he sees the package that is addressed to him in the trash bin and gasps] My circus fleas! [he runs inside, knocking over Squidward] They came! [picks up the package] They came! Hey, this box is empty. Where did the fleas go?
[Squidward pulls up his shirt to reveal that all of the sea fleas are under it]
SpongeBob: Hello, fleas! I hope you fed 'em, Squidward. They get pretty hungry.
Squidward: [the fleas start spreading around his body] Oh, I fed them alright. Please take them away now.
SpongeBob: You got it! [pulls out a whip] Ho! Alley-oop, [uses the whip] wah!
[The sea fleas turn into a clown juggling balls. SpongeBob uses the whip again and the fleas drop the balls into itself. They transform into a big man on a diving board with a bucket on the ground. The big man dives into the bucket, and the fleas turn into a circus.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Now let's take this circus to my place! [a miniature train shows up, and he and the fleas enter it] All aboard! [plays the theme song ending on his nose and makes a train whistle noise. They then head off] May all your days be sea flea circus days! Best day ever! [they enter his house] Woo!
[Squidward is in his now destroyed bedroom.]
Squidward: Huh. Stupid circus fleas. Just look at the mess they've left. [notices a whistle] Hm? What's this? Hmm. [blows into the whistle, causing the sea fleas to come swarming back to him.]

Realizing that it was because of his pet allergy, he discovers that Lady Upturn snuck her pet worm Fifi into the Krusty Krab. He tells her that pets are not allowed, and Mr. Krabs confirms his statement. However, when she says that Krabby Patties are all that Fifi will eat, and that she would gladly pay double for them, Mr. Krabs changes his mind and declares that pets would be allowed to enter the restaurant from then on, much to Squidward's dismay.Mr. Krabs gladly starts making more money than ever he has before. Just then, the health inspector comes in and tells him that he cannot serve both people and pets in the same restaurant, as it is unsanitary. He makes him decide on only one, and Mr. Krabs decides to pick pets, seeing them as more profitable than their owners. He kicks all of the people out, and says that they will still be paying for whatever their pets eat.Due to the new rule established at the Krusty Krab, customers have no choice but to visit the Chum Bucket, upset that they do not have access to the first restaurant mentioned. Suddenly, Larry suggests that everyone should dress up as pets to enter the Krusty Krab and trick Mr. Krabs, and everyone reacts positively to the suggestion. Back at the aforementioned restaurant, Mr. Krabs continues to earn immense amounts of money, to his surprise, some new ""pets"" arrive. Mr. Krabs does not notice anything strange, so he considers them as customers. The real pets and the fake ones do not manage to interact well, so the Krusty Krab turns into chaos. In an attempt to defuse the situation, SpongeBob unmasks the health inspector, who is also in disguise, much to everyone's surprise. With a song, he explains that pets and people deserve to eat side by side, so he decides to make some changes to the rules, which makes everyone happy.As a celebration, customers eat Krabby Patties with their pets, to which the fire marshal (disguised as Incidental 160) reacts by saying that the restaurant is over capacity for fire hazards. Due to that, he shuts down the restaurant and orders customers to leave the restaurant, leaving Mr. Krabs devastated. SpongeBob then tells him that he can make extra charges to him, cheering Mr. Krabs up a bit. The episode ends with an injured and infected Squidward falling down on the floor towards the ground, sneezing for the last time and causing a closing iris to catch his nose.",A Place for Pets,"[The episode opens up to a shot of the Krusty Krab zooming in towards the front entrance with Fred walking into the restaurant. It then transitions to inside the restaurant where we see customers eating and Squidward delivering food to tables.]
Squidward: Order for...
[Incidentals 41 and 42 show looks of excitement as they quickly snatch their food from the plate Squidward is holding. It then shows them eating their food like a bunch of slobs and getting soda all over Squidward.]
Squidward: Eugh, oh. Disgusting. You people eat like animal... animal... anim... Achoo!
[Squidward sneezes and it causes him to slam his head into the plate, getting the two soda cups getting stuck in his eyes. He then pushes his eyes through the bottom of the soda cups and uses them as binoculars as he looks at the table next to him.]
Lady Upturn: Oh, there's my baby. Oh, my little baby!
[Lady Upturn feeds her pet worm who is coming out of her purse a small Krabby Patty. Squidward then pulls the soda cups off of his eyes which results in his eyeballs becoming small. He then walks over to Lady Upturn's table.]
Squidward: Oh no. You cannot bring a worm in here. It's unclean! And some of us are allergi... Achoo!
[Squidward sneezes then hits his head on the table as Lady Upturn and her worm look at him very surprised. Mr. Krabs then rushes onscreen.]
Mr. Krabs: What's with all the sniffy fits out here, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: It's not my fault, Mr. Krabs! She snuck a pet into the restaurant!
Lady Upturn: Oh! I didn't know my sweet little Fifi wasn't allowed. [picks up Fifi and brings her over to Mr. Krabs]
[Fifi then whines at Mr. Krabs with a sad face and then Squidward sneezes all over both Mr. Krabs and Fifi, resulting in her hair flying onto Mr. Krabs' eyestalks. Fifi then strains and makes her hair to grow back instantly.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, your sweet little Foo-Foo's gotta go, we got a strict policy, [gestures toward the sign] no pets allowed.
Lady Upturn: What a shame, Krabby Patties are all my Fee-Fee will eat these days. I would have gladly paid double the price, if it only meant she could have her favorite food...
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [changes the sign] There, all fixed! [shows Lady Upturn the sign] See? Now: Pets Allowed!
Lady Upturn: Oh! How delightful!
Squidward: Of course. [sneezes]
[The scene bubble transitions to several customers eating alongside their pets; Mr. Krabs is literally raking in a pile of cash, and the cash spits out from a machine into his office.]
Mr. Krabs: Hee hee! I tell ya, Mr. Squidward, I'm making more money than Neptune! Hee hee hee! [Squidward sneezes, and his head hits the cash register, leaving an indent]
Health Inspector: Hold it right there, Krabs! [he takes off his little girl disguise]
Mr. Krabs: Oh no, the health inspector!
Health Inspector: Oh yes, the health inspector! And I'm afraid you can't run a restaurant and a feed lot out of the same building! [the scene changes to Bubble Bass eating food on the floor along with two other pets] It's unsanitary. I'm shutting you down! Unless... you pick one. People or pets.
Mr. Krabs: Ohh. Eh... [he looks at a customer with a dollar bill frame] Ooh! [he then looks at multiple pets with dollar bill frames appearing] Oh! Oh, yeah! I choose pets!
Squidward: [chuckles] What?! No!
Mr. Krabs: [pushing the customers out of his restaurant] Alright, you heard the man. If you ain't a pet, you're trespassing. Time to go! Get a move on.
Fred: Wait a minute. What about our pets?
Mr. Krabs: Ooh! Well, don't worry. I'll still be billin' ya for whatever they eat.
Sandy: Whoa! [moves with everyone else out of the way]
[Suddenly, a domesticated variant of an Alaskan Bull Worm emerges from the front entrance and rests by the road. Several boats, including a bus, crash into its behind, causing it to vomit out all of its contents off-screen.]
Sandy and Fred: Eww.
Mr. Krabs: Hoo hoo, Sandy. Your Alaskan Bull Worm certainly was hungry. [puts on glasses and starts punching numbers]
Sandy: [gasps] Sweet jawbone of San Antone, I'm broke! Looks like I'm eatin' [she pulls out a can of nuts] canned nuts for the rest of the year. [she eats some nuts]
[Bubble wipe to the next scene with a customer wanting to go inside the Krusty Krab, while a worm goes inside.]
SpongeBob: Welcome, little worm! Here at the Krusty Krab, it's a pet paradise. [snails, a sea bunny, and a worm are eating some Krabby Patties] Enjoy yourself! And don't forget to order something to eat.
Worm: [barks, then starts licking its tail]
SpongeBob: Oh uh, maybe I'll order for ya. [chuckles]
Incidental 31: [bringing his pet clam to the Krusty Krab. Squidward, now wearing a gas mask, opens the doors and carries it.] Hey man. Could I like, get a Krabby Patty to go?
Squidward: Sorry. Pets only. You can try your luck across the street.
Incidental 31: Aww, I don't wanna eat chum. [starts walking to the Chum Bucket]
Squidward: [laughs until the clam bites his head]
[The scene cuts to the Chum Bucket, where Incidental 31 enters.]
Plankton: [laughs] The house special! [sets a bucket of chum onto the table]
Larry: Ugh. It's great that my pets are eating and all, but I'm still hungry...
Patrick: [Watching the Krusty Krab by a window where a customer's worm notices Patrick and eats Krabby Patties of the floor, and the worm taunts him.] I wish I was a pet, so I could eat off the floor.
Bubble Bass: You are eating off the floor.
Patrick: [with a chum bucket on the floor] Yeah, but, I want to eat Krabby Patties off the floor!
Larry: The pink dude might have the right idea, guys. If we dress up like pets...
Fred: We could trick Krabs into serving us, of course!
Plankton: If you wanna make costumes, I have a craft corner.
[Everyone runs to the craft corner to make animal costumes, making Plankton spin and fall off the table.]
Old Man Walker: [with a blue bottle on his head] Anyone seen the glue?
Plankton: [evil laugh, he gets inside Spot's body] Now's my chance to sneak into the Krusty Krab in my pet, Spot. [Spot barks, then he starts digesting Plankton; Plankton laughs] Hey... what's happening?! [Plankton is being digested by Spot] No, Spot! Stop digesting me, Spot! Bad Spot! [screams, and Spot excretes his eye, then he wanders away.] Barnacles...
[Meanwhile back at the Krusty Krab, everyone is eating Krabby Patty meat while Mr. Krabs puts money away.]
Mr. Krabs: Into the wall you go! [puts the last money stack away and closes the door] [shocked] What the?
[Several costumers walk into the Krusty Krab in animal costumes.]
Fred: Oh boy, I mean arf arf! I'm hungry!
Tom: [laughs] Woof woof!
Mr. Krabs: Hmm... Squidward!
[A clam eats the Krabby Patties Squidward gave him, along with the table.]
Squidward: Yes, Mr.- achoo! Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Why don't all these new pets have patties in front of them? I'm running a business, not a shelter! [He compresses Squidward into his helmet, then kicks him, sending him rolling along the floor]
Bubble Bass: [sliding onto the table where a sea bunny is eating a Krabby Patty] Greetings, fellow lagomorph. Perhaps you might consider sharing a slither of your b- [the sea bunny points and screams at him; six other angry sea bunnies are now behind him] Ooh! I'll just be- [jumps off of the table, and the sea bunnies follow him]
[One of the sea bunnies bites onto Bubble Bass' butt, and rips part of his pants off, making him scream. While running, Bubble Bass bumps a worm's table, startling it, and the patties fall off of the table. The other customers start eating the patties on the floor, and three angry worms appear, which attack the customers.]
Patrick: [in a rock costume] Pet fight! [throws his pet rock into the fight cloud, and joins in as well]
[Mr. Krabs is scared, and an entire fish bone drops in front of him. Fred backs away from four snails that are surrounding him, and he closes his clam costume, to which one of the snails bites his leg.]
Fred: My leg!
Squidward: [hides in the cash register to evade the scallops, which attack him anyway] No no no, bad scallops, [four of the scallops carry him upwards] no, aah! [he breaks through the ceiling; Bubble Bass is still running away from the sea bunnies]
SpongeBob: [opens the kitchen door with a plate of Krabby Patties] Who's ready for... a violent brawl? Stop, please! [gets in between a snail and a customer] The Krusty Krab is a place of peace! [pushes away both of them; he also pulls away another customer and two more pets; finally, he pulls the bear head off of a customer in a bear costume; the health inspector's head pops out, and SpongeBob gasps] The health inspector?
All of the customers: The health inspector?
Health Inspector: Uh... roar?
SpongeBob: [confused] But, I thought you said people and pets can't eat together.
Bubble Bass: [angrily] Yeah, what are you doing here?
Mr. Krabs: [angrily] This whole mess is your fault.
[The angry crowds starts cornering the Health Inspector.]
Customers: Yeah! Yeah yeah yeah!
Health Inspector: [slowly walking back to the wall] Um, I was just hungry for a Krabby Patty. We've all been there, right? Plus, I, uh... I've learned something today. SpongeBob, give me a bouncy ""C,"" would ya?
SpongeBob: [grabs a stool and starts playing a piano] Ooh, gladly!

Mr. Krabs: Yes! And a round of patties for everyone, not on the house! [everyone cheers, bubble wipe to the next scene with pets and people eating together]
Incidental 160: Gosh, mister! You've got more customers here than I've ever seen!
Mr. Krabs: 'Course I do! Didn't you hear the song? ♪Pets are people too!♪
Incidental 160: Well, if they count as people... [rips his disguise and a fire marshal comes out]
Fire marshal: ...Then they count as fire hazards! I'm the fire marshal, and you're over capacity, Krabs! Shut 'er down! Everyone out!
Mr. Krabs: What? No! [everyone grumbles and leaves as the fire marshal hold the door] Wait, come back, come back! Me pet profits! [starts crying] I'm ruined!
SpongeBob: Hey, uh, Mr. Krabs? I was planning on taking a Krabby Patty home to my Gare-Bear. You could overcharge me for it if you want.
Mr. Krabs: Really? Thanks, boyo! [him and SpongeBob hug] You're a good minimum wage employee! [Squidward falls from the roof]

Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs wants the two to sell Krabby Patties, while he puts a sign at the back of the stage.While SpongeBob sells patties using different methods with a vacuum, Squidward sees the backstage door and fantasizes of what would happen if he went in there, which includes playing the clarinet with Claire St. Claire. To ensure SpongeBob does not come inside with him, Squidward tells him to serve one side of the crowd. SpongeBob is disappointed, as he was looking forward to spending time with Squidward, but goes with it anyway. Then, he proceeds to enter the studio. However, along the way, he encounters a guard who tries to beat him up. He gathers fans to distract him, and finds Patrick's room, only to be beaten up by the same guard.Meanwhile, SpongeBob has already served his entire section, and when he sees Squidward's side of the crowd still starving, he decides to sell patties over there for their sake. Squidward sneaks backstage, and hides in a violin case, only to be mistaken for an actual violin when The Low Tides begin to play on stage. Mr. Krabs tries to put the sign in the back of the stage, but gets caught up in the curtains. SpongeBob realizes that The Low Tides have not received Krabby Patties, so he tries to send them patties, but accidentally causes them to leave the stage. Mr. Krabs shows the wrinkled sign up on the stage, but the way it is folded from Mr. Krabs being tangled causes the crowd to think the Krabby Patties were not good as they start booing. Mr. Krabs does the Peg Leg Waltz to win the crowd back as a result, with SpongeBob and Squidward joining in, the latter scaring away the whole crowd as a result. The Low Tides hear this, and Claire St. Claire is impressed by Squidward, thus prompting Squidward to, literally, die happy. But Mr. Krabs revives him to collect cash, and he is still happy, as the episode ends.",Krusty Koncessionaires,"[The episode begins at The Low Tides concert. SpongeBob blows bubbles in the shape of the words ""The Low Tides.""]
Squidward: Wow, I never thought the Low Tides would come to a backwater town like Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: Squidward! I didn't know you like the Low Tides! [hugs Squidward]
[Squidward frowns and pushes SpongeBob away.]
Squidward: Yeah, They're fine. But that Claire St. Claire is the real talent, they say his clarinet is so fancy it doesn't play any wrong notes!
Mr. Krabs: Alright, enough nonsense, listen up. This year the biggest concert to come to Bikini Bottom in decades. Smell that boys?
SpongeBob: You smell like corn chips, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: I just smell the toilets.
[Grubby Grouper comes out of the bathroom with toilet paper in his butt.]
Grubby Grouper: Phew.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah. All that's in the air too. Along with the smell of money! The show is sold out, which means there's 30,000 fans in there. And you are going to sell a Krabby Patty to every single one of them!
SpongeBob: What a great way to make 30,000 new friends! Don't you think, Squidward? Don't you?
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh great, and what are you going to do while we work all day?
Mr. Krabs: Glad you asked Mr. Squidward, I will be taking the toughest job of all, I'll be sneaking on stage to unfurl this here banner that I made meself. [as he reveals the banner] Da-da-da-daaa!

SpongeBob: [suddenly very blue] Mmm, well, I was looking forward to spending the whole day with you...
Squidward: [with faux sadness] I know, I'm so disappointed.

Female Announcer: [through the microphone and speaker] Ladies and gentlefish, mollusks and fries. Here's the band you've all been waiting for. You know them, you love them, It's The Low Tides!
[crowd cheers and the curtains rise while Squidward tries to hide in the cello case as the band comes on stage. A blind cello player thinks Squidward is the cello and plays him as the band starts a song]
Squidward: Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. [the crowd continues cheering and applauding]
Guitarist: I was a lonely, lonely lad, a Solitary Soul! Didn't have the rock, and I didn't know how to roll. Joined me a band, singing on a stage, they was swooning and a-screaming, and now I'm all the rage! Feeding Frenzy, everyone wants a piece of me. It's a feeding frenzy, I can't get me no privacy. How am I gonna shake 'em?
Two people in the audience: Is it really him?
Guitarist: The freaky fans found me. Man, they'll tear me limb from limb! They claw at my clothes, steal my shoes, tear out my hair, I got nothing left to lose. Oh, it's a feeding frenzy, the kids can't get enough. Oh, it's a feeding frenzy, this rock-n-roll is getting kinda rough!
Patrick: Buddy, could you put down your phone? [Patrick has a projector and microphone] You're blocking my shot! [SpongeBob looks through his telescope to see people eating Krabby Patties]
SpongeBob: Ah. Looks like everyone has a patty. [sees the Low Tides on stage] Everyone but the band! [can't get pass the crowd and gets an idea to go up the speakers] Aha! Must...sell...patties! [takes his Krabby patty Vacuum, presses the button to extreme but many patties shoot out of the vacuum but he manages to get on the speaker. Meanwhile, two people carry a chest with the sneaky Mr. Krabs inside]
Mr. Krabs: There's no stopping me this time. Here we go. A 1, a 2. [buzzer sounds] Huh? Hey! What's going on?! [a big inflatable pirate comes out of the chest with Mr. Krabs on it. Mr. Krabs then sees SpongeBob on the speaker]
SpongeBob: Special delivery for the Low Tides!
[SpongeBob shoots patties from the vacuum to the Low Tides and Squidward gets some patties into his mouth. Mr. Krabs accidentally pops the inflatable and the band runs off the stage as one band member drags the blind cello player saying ""Come on!"" The inflatable pirate lands on Squidward and Mr. Krabs lifts up the banner]
Mr. Krabs: Don't forget! Brought to you by the Krusty Krab!
Man in crowd: [reading the banner that is crumpled up] ""The Krusty Krab. A Krummy Place to Eat?"" [not reading] I didn't know they were selling us crummy food.
Mr. Krabs: [sees the crumbled up banner and tries to fix it] Oh, come on! [chuckles nervously]
Man in crowd: Boo! Boo, I say! [the crowd throws patties at Mr. Krabs, but most land on the wall]
Mr. Krabs}Hey, no, no, no! You don't understand! It's not crummy, it's yummy. [as the crowd continue to jeer and boo him, Mr. Krabs does the Peg Leg Waltz.]
SpongeBob: Oh, that's a hot beat, Mr. Krabs. [plays his nose like a flute]
Man in crowd: That's pretty good.
Incidental 37B: Yeah, let's give 'em a chance. [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs continue doing the Peg Leg Waltz, then Squidward comes out of the inflatable pirate, holding Claire St. Claire's clarinet.]
Squidward: [twirls Claire St. Claire's clarinet] Alright. Time for a little licorice stick. [inhales deeply]
Incidental 37B: Squidward's got a clarinet! Run! [the crowd runs out of the concert, just before Squidward plays wonderful music from Claire St. Claire's clarinet and SpongeBob and Krabs join in, and they finish doing the Peg Leg Waltz]
Squidward: I can't believe it! This really is the greatest clarinet ever made! And you're the greatest audience I've ever--huh? [sees that the crowd is gone and is disappointed]
Claire St. Claire: [walks on stage with the Low Tides] Nice jam, baby.
Squidward: Validation? Oh, thank you, Claire St. Claire! Oh, this is the best day of my life! I can die happy! [happily faints on the ground with a smile as his smiling soul leaves his body, meaning that Squidward had literally died happy]
Mr. Krabs: Oh no, you don't! [grabs Squidward's soul and pushes it back in his body] You're working tonight, and corpses can't collect cash!
Squidward: [still happy] Well, still the best day of my life.",0.66,Andrew Goodman

After that, they go to the Glove World theater to see a presentation by Hieronymus Glove. When the presentation is done, SpongeBob and Patrick stay to meet Hieronymus Glove himself. However, Patrick accidentally destroys Hieronymus Glove and causes a scene at the theater.The officers come to deal with the situation, and they tell SpongeBob and Patrick that the Hieronymus Glove they destroyed was a robot. However, they still send SpongeBob and Patrick down to Glove World! Jail due to their act of destroying Glove World! property. The two are excited to go to jail and when they reach their cell, they meet a couple of kids who were also sent to Glove World! jail.Later, the toddler goes out of the cell, prompting SpongeBob and Patrick to get out of the cell to get him back, while the other kids think they are doing a jailbreak. Meanwhile, two repairmen carry the robot Hieronymus Glove to repair him. When they go on break, he creates a plan to get revenge on Patrick for breaking his head as the first act ends.As the second act begins, SpongeBob and Patrick catch the toddler, but get intrigued by a group of testers testing several things for Glove World! After going through several tests, they see a prototype for Sock World. At the same time, the toddler escapes again and ends up putting himself in the body of the animatronic Hieronymus Glove.When SpongeBob and Patrick see that the toddler is in the animatronic body, they chase him through several areas until they eventually end up in Sock World. When Patrick turns off the stench of the place, the toddler escapes again.SpongeBob and Patrick find the toddler on the water ride at Sock World and continue chasing him, while the animatronic Hieronymus Glove follows them. When they reach the end of the ride, the animatronic Hieronymus Glove gets back into his body and wants to take Patrick's head, but when he takes his head off willingly, Hieronymus Glove says he wanted to take it off.This leads to his head and Patrick's head getting into a battle until the real Hieronymus Glove, who is trapped in ice, comes and gets his servants to reboot the animatronic version of himself so he can cause no more harm.The real Hieronymus Glove releases SpongeBob and Patrick and they sing another song about gloves while the three go back up to the surface of Glove World! on a stage, as the episode ends.",Escape from Beneath Glove World,"[The episode begins with a speakerphone shown up close.]
Man on speaker: What a beautiful day for a ball game, eh, sports fans? [a butterfly flies to the speaker] Play ball! [the butterfly flies away] Here's the pitch! [A robotic arm is shown with a baseball. The arm throws the ball. The camera turns around, revealing SpongeBob and Patrick. They are on a ride of Glove World! An invisible person with gloves swings the bat and hits the ball which sends SpongeBob and Patrick away.] They're going, they're going!
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're gone!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are pressed into the seats as the ride accelerates. The ball lands on a glove and an animatronic coach comes to the scene.]
Animatronic Coach: You're outta there!
[SpongeBob and Patrick exit out of the baseball and leave the ride. The scene cuts to outside the ride, which is called ""Catch Me!"", as SpongeBob and Patrick exit the ride.]
SpongeBob: Boy, do I love the two-fisted fun at Glove World! [laughs]
Patrick: [hands out a fist on a stick] And the Ham Fists aren't bad either! [starts chewing on it]
SpongeBob: Wow, that ride was so fun! I could do it a million, zillion, jillion, dillion, cotillion times! [breathes]
Patrick: [nudges SpongeBob with his elbow] I got you covered!
[Patrick squeezes out a bunch of tickets out of his belly button and they pile up on him and SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh, yeah!
[They run back inside the ride with the tickets around them.]
French Narrator: One million, zillion, jillion, dillion, cotillion times later...

Animatronic Coach: You're outta there! Eh, whatever.
[SpongeBob and Patrick exit the ride with their faces frozen after riding it a lot of times. They walk up to a woman. Her baby screams in terror at SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Woman Fish: Oh, my baby's eyes! [runs away]
SpongeBob: [face frozen] Patrick?
Patrick: [face frozen] Yes?
SpongeBob: [face frozen] I think we overdid it. [he and Patrick lean back up. A child approaches them, carrying popcorn. Upon seeing them, he starts screaming, throws his popcorn at them and runs away.]
Patrick: [face frozen] Hmm, debatable.
SpongeBob: [face frozen] Oh, I have an idea! [French accent] Let us take a break in the theater. [cut to the outside of Glove World Theater.]
[Cut back to SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob takes out a glove and slaps Patrick to get his face back to normal. Patrick takes the glove, adjusts it and slaps SpongeBob to get his face back to normal. They merrily walk into the theater.]
Patrick: Snack bar break!
[Cut to inside the theater, where SpongeBob and Patrick are eating fries out of their hats. After finishing their fries, they put their hats back on and use their eyes to rip out eye holes in the hats. The curtains open, revealing an animatronic. The audience begins to cheer.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: It's him! It's really him! [their hats point at the animatronic]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Right! It's me, Hieronymus Glove! I'm the bloomin' creator and spokes-mate of Glove World!
[An animatronic glove appears.]
Animatronic Glove: Glove World is a subsidiary of Finger Fun Industries. All rights reserved. [SpongeBob and Patrick cheer and headbutt each other as the show begins.]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Welcome to the wonderfully whimsical and wickedly woven world of the glove! [Music begins playing and a giant glove-shaped screen appears. The screen powers on and displays two floating gloves and the words ""Glove World Presents."" SpongeBob and Patrick's pupils turn into gloves as Animatronic Hieronymus begins singing.] ♪If you want where something on your hand or fist, there's really nothing quite like gloves!♪
[The screen shows a mountain-climbing fish with frostbitten hands. Two gloves pass the screen, and he is now wearing them, displaying them to the screen and smiling.]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: [singing] ♪And if you don't want to leave fingerprints, I've got a pair that you're just gonna love!♪
[A burglar steals a diamond off a pillow, then leans out the window and gives a thumbs up to the camera.]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: [singing] ♪If you want complete knuckle protection when you stick your hand inside a block of cheese!♪

Animatronic Gloves: [singing] ♪Gloves!♪
[The show ends and the audience starts cheering. SpongeBob and Patrick headbutt each other again. The audience begins leaving.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] That song reminds me of putting on a glove for the very first time. It was warm, and cozy... and sweaty.
Patrick: I wanna meet the glove guy!
SpongeBob: Ooh! [pulls out a bunch of gloves wadded into a ball] Maybe he'll sign my gloves.
[Patrick makes his way to the stage, hopping over the seats. SpongeBob follows him and accidentally drops his gloves on the floor. While SpongeBob picks up his gloves, Patrick peeks through the curtains and sees the animatronic. He runs towards it and gives it a handshake.]
Patrick: [giggles excitedly] Oh, Mr. Glove, Mr. Glove! Oh, I'm your biggest fan! I've been all your rides, ask anyone! I-I'm here every weekend! And throwing up! [Patrick breaks the animatronic's hand.] I just-- Huh?
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: [eyes flash red] I need repair! I need repair!
Patrick: Oh! I'm sorry! It was an accident! [shushes the robot and puts his hand in his mouth] Please be quiet or I'll get in trouble!
[Animatronic Hieronymus Glove keeps saying ""I need repair!"" The hand drops from the robot's mouth and rolls away. Patrick grabs Animatronic Hieronymus in a headlock and shushes him again.] Stupid! [shushes the animatronic once more] Shut up, shut up, shut up! [rips off Animatronic Hieronymus's head]
[SpongeBob comes in and sees Patrick destroying the animatronic.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing with our childhood hero? [accidentally press a button labeled ""Run.""]
Patrick: He wouldn't be quiet.
[Suddenly, the robot starts moving to the stage, pushing Patrick along with him. The curtains open to reveal Patrick holding Animatronic Hieronymus's head. As Patrick fumbles with the head, he notices everyone looking at him in shock. An old fish's glasses crack, and everyone screams. Patrick tries to put the head back on, but drops it. The audience members run out of the theater. Patrick trips over himself and brings down the curtains, and three Glove World officers enter from backstage.]
Officer #1: Freeze, vandals!
Patrick: [comes out of the curtains and uses the head to fight the officers off] Keep away! Keep away, no! No! Get away!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, just calm down a second. Take a deep breath and hand me the head. [walks towards Patrick]
Officer #1: Better do what your friend says, son.
[Patrick calmly gives SpongeBob the head and starts crying]
SpongeBob: Oh, officers, he didn't mean to kill Hieronymus Glove! He just doesn't know his own strength. Or his own reflection. I don't know how he shaves!
[Close-up on Patrick's chin with rips, a bandage, stitches, and little hairs. SpongeBob begins to cry and blows his nose on the animatronic's head.]
Officer #1: He didn't kill anyone, kid. This is not a real head; it's an animatronomical dummy head.
Patrick: [angrily] Hey, who are calling a dummy head?! [confused] Wait, what did you say?
Officer #1: The real Hieronymus Glove has been frozen in ice for decades now. [shows SpongeBob and Patrick his hat which shows a picture of Hieronymus Glove frozen in an ice cube]
SpongeBob: [realizing] Oh, Patrick, it was only a robot head. Phew, for a minute there, I thought we were in trouble!
[SpongeBob and Patrick try to leave, but Officer #1 grabs them]
Officer #1: You are in trouble! And you're going to Glove World Jail!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [gasps, excitedly] Glove World Jail?
SpongeBob: I thought that was an urban myth!
Patrick: You mean an urban truth.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Glove me! [The officer puts SpongeBob and Patrick in handcuffs. An elevator emerges from beneath the stage. SpongeBob, Patrick, and the three officers enter the elevator.] Jailtime jackpot! [they high-five]
Officer #1: Please don't do that.
[SpongeBob and Patrick giggle as the elevator closes and descends into an underground jail. The elevator door opens to reveal that SpongeBob and Patrick have tangled Officer #1 in their handcuffs.]
SpongeBob: Sorry.
Patrick: Yeah, he's sorry.
[The officer takes SpongeBob and Patrick into Glove World Jail and throws them in a cell. They hit the wall, breaking their handcuffs, and fall into a ball pit filled with gloves.]
Officer #1: Alright, close number five!
[A small opening appears in the wall and three little gloves come out. SpongeBob and Patrick emerge from the ball pit to watch as the gloves do a little dance, then hop on top of each other and close the cell door. SpongeBob and Patrick cheer for them.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is exactly how I always thought Glove Jail would look!
Patrick: [pointing] Look!
[SpongeBob and Patrick lean against the bars and see three animatronic prisoners a nearby cell trying to get a key from an animatronic worm. They then look in the other direction and see two animatronic glove guards pacing back and forth, greeting each other repeatedly. Then they look behind them and see a barrel in the corner. They walk to the barrel and an animatronic old man pops out.]
Animatronic Old Man: Breaking the rules, eh? [laughs] Good for you, matey!
Patrick: Well, I didn't break the rules. I broke a dummy head.
Animatronic Old Man: Breaking the rules, eh? [laughs] Good for you, matey!
Patrick: I just told you! [leans into the barrel] Stop saying that!
Animatronic Old Man: [rams into Patrick as he pops back up] Breaking the rules, eh? [laughs]
Patrick: [grabs the animatronic old man in a choke hold] Shut up, shut up, shut up!
SpongeBob: Oh, not again, Patrick. He's just a robot! They're all robots. We're the only ones here. [A toddler pops out of the ball pit. While SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing, the toddler climbs up onto SpongeBob's head and pulls on his eyelashes.] Aww, hello there! What's a little guy like you doing in jail?
Patrick: Pooping without a license? [he and SpongeBob start laughing] You heard that, right?
SpongeBob: Pooping! License!
[As SpongeBob and Patrick continue to laugh, some other kids rise up from the ball pit. SpongeBob and Patrick notice them and scream in surprise.]
Patrick: Uh, hello?
SpongeBob: Oh, eh... Hello.
Prison Kid #1: Hey, man, what you in for?
SpongeBob: Defacing Glove World property.
Patrick: [making air quotes] Allegedly!
SpongeBob: What are you all in for?
Prison Kid #2: [without any arms or legs] I didn't keep my arms and legs inside the ride at all times. [grows back his limbs]
Prison Kid #3: [with a ""Don't Stand Up"" sign stuck on his head] I stood up at the top of the roller coaster.
Helen: [breaks the leg off of a doll she's holding] Murder one! [bites the doll's leg and growls. The other kids take a step back] I'm kidding, I'm just here 'cause I bit the lemonade guy.
Prison Kid #3: That guy hates kids!
Helen: That's why I bit him. High-five! [they high-five.]
[A kid comes up with cotton candy shaped like rats.]
Prison Kid #4: Let's celebrate! Cotton candy rats for everyone!
[The kids start cheering along with SpongeBob and Patrick as the cotton candy falls into Patrick's mouth. Patrick becomes hyper after eating the cotton candy. He jumps into the air.]
SpongeBob: Oh-oh, I think I smell a...
Patrick: Cannonball!
[Patrick jumps into the ball pit as the kids cheer and SpongeBob laughs. He then notices the toddler escaping through the bars and stops laughing.]
SpongeBob: Uh, hey, little guy, come back! You're too little to be on your own! [the toddler walks past an animatronic glove guard] Hey, Patrick, we've gotta...
[SpongeBob looks back and notices the kids playing with Patrick by spinning him around. SpongeBob then stretches his arm to try and grab the key from the animatronic worm, but winds up squeezing through the bars.]
Helen: [notices SpongeBob out of the cell.] Hey, you mugs, it's a jail break! Let's amscray!
[All the kids escape through the bars, and one of them jumps on SpongeBob's head as he leaves. Patrick, still spinning, runs into the bars and gets tangled in them. He then frees himself and SpongeBob stops him from spinning.]
Patrick: I think I stood up too quick.
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, we have to go after that escaped little boy!
Patrick: Looks like we all escaped.
SpongeBob: [walks towards a lever] I'll pull the escape alarm. We don't wanna break the law twice. [SpongeBob pulls the lever and the alarm goes off.] Huh?
Patrick: Hey! Is that the kid?
SpongeBob: Ah! That's him! Little boy, come back! [holding cotton candy rat] I saved you a rat!
[Two repairmen walk by, carrying the pieces of Animatronic Hieronymus.]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: I need repair! I need repair! [The repairmen enter a robotics lab. They place Animatronic Hieronymus's body on a chair and set his head down on a table.] I need repair! I need repair! I need repair! I need repair! [One of the repairmen browses his toolbox, pulls out a wrench, and whacks Animatronic Hieronymus's head with it.] Reboot, reboot. [closes his eyes, then opens them and looks around angrily]
Repairman #1: Alright, break time! [tosses his wrench aside]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Hey, you grease monkeys! No tea breaks! Put my head back on my body this bloomin' instant!
Repairman #2: Yeah, we'll get right on that... [mockingly] Gov'nor!
[both repairmen laugh and walk away while Animatronic Hieronymus growls at them. After they leave, the door slams and Animatronic Hieronymus's head falls into a bucket of nuts and bolts.]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Whoa! [Animatronic Hieronymus Glove shines a beam of light from his eye, projecting a memory of Patrick ripping off his head.] If I ever see that pink dimwitted doughboy again, I'll take his bloomin' head off! [turns himself around] Hmph! [Act 1 ends.]
[The episode continues with the toddler climbing a ladder. SpongeBob follows the toddler, stretches his arms, and grabs the toddler.]
SpongeBob: Gotcha! [SpongeBob jumps down and lands on the ground as Patrick runs to the ladder.] Better hold his hand. That way he won't wonder off. [They both hold the toddler's hand and continue down the hall. They enter a section with many doors.] Hmm, so many doors. [shifts his eyes around his body, twists himself, and spins] Which way should we go? [Two construction workers drive past them and four glove testers walk by. The glove testers step onto a conveyor belt, and Patrick follows closely behind.]
Glove testers: [muttering indistinctly] Research, research, research...
Patrick: I wanna ride the slide walk! [steps onto the conveyor belt, yanking SpongeBob and the toddler along with him.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! [his legs wobble as he tries to keep balance.]
Patrick: [lifts his arms up] This is crazy!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [reading a sign] ""Danger? Glove Testing""? [excited] Ooooooooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! [Robotic arms descend from the ceiling and strap goggles on SpongeBob and Patrick. Another arm tries to put a pair of goggles on the toddler, but they're too big so the arm places the goggles around his shoulders like an oversized necklace. The group is brought to a window looking in on a room with a guy chained to two poles by his wrists. A ray gun and a flamethrower appear; the guy chuckles and gives a thumbs-up, and they zap him. SpongeBob covers the toddler's eyes. After the machines are done zapping the guy, robotic arms remove the gloves he was wearing, revealing that his hands are completely unscathed. The entire group claps and cheers.]
Patrick: A success. [The conveyor belt starts moving again. Two robotic arms flatten the glove testers, covering them in metal armor. They do the same to SpongeBob, Patrick, and the toddler. They approach a room labeled ""Guard Glove Training.""]
SpongeBob and Patrick: ""Guard Glove Training""? [The group is brought into the room and the conveyor belt stops moving.]
Man on Speaker: Release the gloves. [A bell rings and some doors open, letting several guard gloves, glove-like dogs, run up to the group. Three of them run up to SpongeBob, Patrick, and the toddler, trying to bite through the armor.]
SpongeBob: Aww, they must smell Gary. [The camera zooms out, revealing two other guard gloves attacking the four glove testers. One of the glove testers has been knocked over and gets dragged off as a bell rings, signaling for the guard gloves to return to their kennels.]
Glove Tester: Help! Tell Mom I love her! [The armor on SpongeBob, Patrick, and the toddler crumbles and breaks off. The conveyor belt starts moving again and they approach a room labeled ""Sock World Prototype.""]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh-oh-oh! ""Sock World Prototype""? [They enter the room and see a sign that reads ""Sock World.""]
Man on Speaker: Yes, Sock World! The eighth wonder of the seven seas! The experimental prototype smelly city... of the future! Please keep your nose pins on at all times [Two robot arms put nose pins on SpongeBob and Patrick. Another one puts a nose pin on the toddler.] 'Cause seriously, the stink is like... wow!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Stinky sock coasters are like... wow!
SpongeBob: Don't you love it, little guy? [SpongeBob and Patrick notice the little kid is gone.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Little guy!? [they look behind them, and then back at each other.]
Patrick: Oh! Maybe he's hiding in my mouth! [opens his mouth] Is he in there?
SpongeBob: [hears the toddler laughing and points in the distance] There he is!
Patrick: Ahhh, get him out of there! Ah! I'm not hungry yet! [The toddler pops up from a pile of gloves near some barrels, and runs off.]
SpongeBob: Let's go! [grabs Patrick's hand and runs after the toddler, pulling Patrick along.] [The toddler enters the robotic lab. He hops into Animatronic Hieronymus Glove's body, then grabs his broken hand. He tries to put the hand back in place, but gives up and tosses it aside. Animatronic Hieronymus Glove pops out of the bucket and gets hit by his own hand. The little kid stands up with the body and tries to keep his balance, crashing into many things. He then gains his balance with the body and walks out of the lab. Animatronic Hieronymus Glove pops out of the bucket and notices the kid with his body.]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Gah, thief! That's Glove World's bloomin' property! [falls back into the bucket] [SpongeBob and Patrick enter the lab and run into the toddler but don't recognize him.]
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, after you, sir. [the toddler leaves the lab.] Oh, I don't see the kid, Patrick.
Patrick: Pardon me, gents. Did anyone seen a little kid come through? [They look around the room and see robot parts everywhere.]
SpongeBob: Oh!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Robot morgue? Cool! [SpongeBob and Patrick pretend to be robots.]
SpongeBob: Beep boop! Beep beep boop! Beep! Beep! Beep! Boop!
Patrick: Errr, eeeh! Beeeep, beep! Beep, boop, beep! [They walk over to some hanging robots and shake hands with them, but they get electrocuted.] Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [Water is sprayed on them, and they turn around.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Huh? [They see the toddler holding a bucket. The toddler giggles and runs off.]
Patrick: Hey, did that kid eat a robot? Or did that robot eat a kid?
SpongeBob: Either way, it's probably against the rules. Let's get him! [They run after the kid as Animatronic Hieronymus Glove pops out of the bucket.]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: It's the blinking bloke that broke off me melon! Whoaaa! [the bucket falls over and he picks himself up. He notices his hand on the floor and jumps on it to attach it to the bottom of his head] Aha! Nobody breaks off my bloomin' head and gets away with it! [wires come out of his mouth] I'M HIERONYMUS GLOVE! [An animatronic glove appears and speaks to the viewers.]
Animatronic Glove: This robot head does not reflect the views of Finger Fun Industries. [The animatronic glove disappears and Animatronic Hieronymus exits the lab, chuckling evilly. Back down the hall, SpongeBob and Patrick are chasing after the toddler.]
Patrick: Ahhhhhhh!
SpongeBob: Come here, little guy! That's a good boy! [the toddler opens a door and runs inside, with SpongeBob and Patrick following closely behind him. Animatronic Hieronymus arrives, headbutts a panel, and uses his wires to tamper with some circuitry, setting off an alarm.] D'ah! Wait up, little guy! [The floor tilts downward and they all fall, landing on a slide that takes them to a giant dryer-themed ride.] D'oh... gotcha! [he and Patrick grab the toddler's hands]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Let's see if these bloomin' bozos like this blinking blimey ride! [hits himself with his own hand, turns himself into a coin, and puts himself in the ride's giant coin slot. The ride starts, spinning SpongeBob, Patrick, and the toddler so fast they get pinned to the wall.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ahhh! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoaaaaaaaaa! Whoa-whoa-whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [the ride stops and they all fall to the floor, landing in a pile of clean socks.] [tired] Woo-hoo! [the floor bottoms out, dropping them all down, Animatronic Hieronymus goes down after them.] Aaaaaaaaaah!
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Hahaha!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Aaah-- huh? Woo-hoo!
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Hahahahahahahahahahahaha! [they all land in a much larger pile of clean socks.]
SpongeBob: Mmmm, warm socks just out of the dryer... [they all sink into the socks, and then SpongeBob and Patrick resurface.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oooh! [Patrick, wearing a sock over his head, uses his eyes to rip out eye holes in the sock. The scene cuts to a view of Sock World.] Huhhhhhhhh? Ahhhhhhhh! There really is a Sock World! [they grin excitedly, but then a strong stench approaches and they shrivel up.] And it really does stink! Oooh-hoo-hoo! [the toddler comes out from the sock pile and is disgusted by the smell. SpongeBob walks up and grabs his hand.]
SpongeBob: Ewww! This place is the greatest, but I wish I could turn the smell down a scotch.
Patrick: Hey, I found the stink switch! [he pulls a nose-shaped lever and the stench goes away.]
SpongeBob: Yay, Patrick! See, little guy? Everything is gonna be just... [he notices that the toddler is gone, and he is only holding a disembodied animatronic hand] Fine! [he tosses the hand aside and frantically looks for the toddler. Upbeat banjo music plays as the toddler runs playfully around Sock World, with the handless arms of Animatronic Hieronymus's body flailing behind him. The sparks coming out of the arms set fire to three animatronic socks, and the banjo music dies down as the animatronics melt. SpongeBob whistles.] Patrick! [Patrick runs up and SpongeBob jumps on his back.] Follow that kid!
Patrick: Vroom-oom-oom-oom! [runs off with SpongeBob on his back. Animatronic Hieronymus pops out of the sock pile. His two disembodied hands fist-bump each other and attach themselves to the bottom of his head, and he chases after SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Hoohahaha!
[the toddler runs up to a water ride and boards one of the cars.]
SpongeBob: He's headed for the Soggy Sock Flume!
Patrick: The first time you called me your best friend... was on the Glove Flume!
SpongeBob: Awww! [hugs Patrick.] Awww! Stop, best friend! Stop! [Patrick tries to stop running but rams into the side of the Soggy Sock Flume, sending them both flying. They land upside-down in one of the cars.]
SpongeBob: Ah! Whoa!
Patrick: whoa! whoa?! Huh? Wahoo!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [they adjust themselves and notice that the toddler is in the car in front of them.] There he is!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, kid, we're right behind you! [the toddler looks back at them and giggles. Animatronic Hieronymus appears in the water and swims up to SpongeBob and Patrick's car.] Stay right there! We're coming!
Patrick: Don't stand up or they'll put you in Sock Jail!
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Baaaaaaaaaah! [bites off the back of the car]
Patrick: Do you feel a draft, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I was gonna ask you the same thing... [Animatronic Hieronymus bites Patrick's butt]
Patrick: Aaaaaaaaah! Do you feel a pain in your butt?
SpongeBob: No. [Animatronic Hieronymus bites SpongeBob's butt] Ayyyyyye! Now I do! Gaaaaaah!
Patrick: Oooo-ooow!
[the cars reach the top of the ride and start sliding down. SpongeBob and Patrick scream while the toddler squeals in delight. The toddler gets sucked out of Animatronic Hieronymus's body due to the sheer speed, but pulls himself back in. The cars reach the bottom of the ride and the toddler uses it to hop out of the water and jump around Sock World with it. SpongeBob and Patrick follow suit and try to catch him.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, no more playing footsies! We gotta save that kid! [they take a huge jump and land in front of the toddler.] Now we gotcha!
Toddler: Huh?
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: [reattaches his hand to his body] Come here, you little whippersnapper! [grabs the toddler and reattaches his head and other hand to his body] Now I've got you !
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hieronymus Glove's robot!
SpongeBob: Hey, you found the kid! Thanks, we'll take him off your hands now!
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Sure, you can have him. [points at Patrick] Right after I take off his bloomin' head!
SpongeBob: [gasps and steps in front of Patrick] Nooooo! [Patrick brushes him aside and pulls his own head off.]
Patrick: [offering his head to the surprised Animatronic Hieronymus] Here you go, I did it for you.
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: [Disappointed and angry] Awww, I wanted to do it! That's the whole point, you pink plonker! [slaps Patrick's head away]
SpongeBob: [catches Patrick's head] Hot potato! [tosses it to Patrick]
Patrick: [fumbles with his head] Huh? Ha! Huh? Whoa! [tosses it back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [fumbles with the head] Heads up! [tosses it to Animatronic Hieronymus. He catches it and throws the toddler to SpongeBob. SpongeBob makes a kid-sized pouch with his body and puts the toddler in it.] I should've done this hours ago! Oh, that's a good boy! [pats the toddler's head]
Patrick: I don't know what a pink plonker is, but I don't like it! [punches Animatronic Hieronymus with his tongue, knocking his head off.]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Aaaaaaaaah!
Patrick: [attaches himself to Animatronic Hieronymus's body] Ooh! Hey! I like this body better than mine... it comes with pockets!
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: I like my new body too! [walks up using Patrick's body which he struggles to control ] But I still want that head! [tries to fight Patrick]
Patrick: I said I was sorry, you weirdo! [they continue fighting, and knock each other's heads off. The heads keep fighting on the ground and SpongeBob jumps to avoid them while the toddler laughs and claps.]
Hieronymus Glove: Enough! [the heads stop fighting, and the real Hieronymus Glove, stuck in a block of ice, rolls up to them while a pair of servants sweep the ground in front of him.] No, no, this won't do at all! Put those heads back on their bodies post-haste! [the servants toss their brooms aside and walk towards the group] Splendid!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow! [the servants put Patrick's head back on his body] Are you the real Hieronymus Glove?
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: [the servants put Animatronic Hieronymus's head back on his body] No, he's not, I'm the real Hieronymus Glove!
Hieronymus Glove: Hahahaha, splendid! Do wipe that one's memory bank before he does more damage to my park. Thank you! [one of the servants whacks Patrick's head with a giant wrench] Not him, the other one!
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Hmm? [the servant whacks Animatronic Hieronymus's head with the wrench] Ow! Re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-- and that's why we wear gloves on our hands and not our knees! Haha... [he powers down and falls over. The servants catch him and carry him away.]
Hieronymus Glove: Splendid! I'm afraid I'm the real Hieronymus Glove, and I'm at your service.
SpongeBob and Patrick: We love your gloves!
Hieronymus Glove: Splendid! And since being terrorized by our robots has never been Glove World policy, you are all hereby released from Glove Jail!
SpongeBob and Patrick: We've been pardoned! Splendid!
Hieronymus Glove: Splendid! And for proving yourselves to be unselfish and kind, I'm going to give all of Glove World to the both of you!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ahhhhhh! [the servants weld crowns to SpongeBob and Patrick's heads] Really?
Hieronymus Glove: Of course not! Hahahahaha! I may be cryogenically frozen, but I'm not a loony! [they all laugh, and the floor rises up to take them back to Glove World as Hieronymus begins singing]
Hieronymus Glove: [singing] ♪Well, that concludes our show and as you can see, there still is nothing quite like gloves!♪ ♪Until we meet again for a shopping spree, where I hope you buy all kinds of gloves to love!♪ ♪With the handy help of SpongeBob and Patrick, we defeated my crazy robot head! ♪ ♪Now that the twit is gone...♪
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: [singing] ♪Glove World can carry on!♪
Hieronymus Glove: [singing] ♪And the toddler can go to bed. Goodnight!♪
[SpongeBob and Patrick fall asleep as the curtains go down. The toddler jumps out of their arms and runs off, waking them up.]
Patrick: Hey! [they go running after him]
SpongeBob: Come back here, little guy!

He uses a dinner roll in an attempt to make the waiter slip and spill soup on him so he can get his meal for free, but the waiter lands the soups successfully.

Mrs. Puff: [giggles] I don't know. What do you think, Krabsy-Wabsy?
Mr. Krabs: The water looks delicious, Puffcake.

Mr. Krabs: [gulps] Start?
Mrs. Puff: Followed by the Sargasso Salad, [Mr. Krabs' menu gets set on fire] and the Sweet and Sour Algae.

Mrs. Puff: Oh, yes! We must try that, Eugene. We'll take two.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs nervously] Yeah, sure. [chuckles] Of course.

Mr. Krabs: [pulls coupons out of his suit] Do you take Krusty Krab coupons? [the waiter kicks him out of the restaurant, and Mr. Krabs sees Mrs. Puff walking away. He grabs onto Mrs. Puff's dress as she walks] Oh! Oh, no, don't go sweetie Puff! Your little Krabsy is so sorry!
Mrs. Puff: [slaps Mr. Krabs] Once again, you ruined our whole evening by being cheap! I thought you cared about me!
Mr. Krabs: I do. I'll make it up to you, honey biscuit. Tomorrow night at my house, we'll have the most romantic and fancy type meal you ever tasted!

SpongeBob: [ringing Mr. Krabs' doorbell repeatedly] I love working free overtime!
Squidward: Like I love the sweet embrace of death.
Mr. Krabs: [opens the door] Get inside, you two, before Puff sees ya! [drags SpongeBob and Squidward into his kitchen] SpongeBob, you're cooking a fancy pants dinner for me and Mrs. Puff.
SpongeBob: I came prepared, Mr. Krabs. [he rips off his clothes, revealing a tuxedo and shiny black pants] Fancy pants for a fancy meal.
Squidward: Ha! SpongeBob can't cook anything but grease trap muck! He's not a gourmet like moi!
SpongeBob: Not true! I can cook fancy food! [whispering into Mr. Krabs' ear] I once made a Krabby Patty with three buns.
Mr. Krabs: You make a good point, Squidward. That's why you're gonna use your hyperlutin' knowledge to supervise him.
Squidward: Of course.
Mr. Krabs: [whistles] Pearl! You're serving the food. [holds out a small dress suit]
Pearl: [walks in] But Daddy, I was planning on staring at my phone tonight! [sighs and attempts putting on fancy dress as SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs walk into the kitchen. Pearl crashes into a wall behind her]
[in the kitchen]
Squidward: This place is ancient! How are we supposed to cook anything with this junk?
Mr. Krabs: What are you talking about? [banging on the oven] This is high quality Navy surplus here! [the oven opens, revealing a group of old pirates cooking with a campfire who run out quickly] Heh heh heh.  So, maybe it's a little outdated. Now just get cooking! And that dinner better be fantastic, or else! [hears doorbell ringing] Ooh! Me lady fair is here! [dashes out of the kitchen to get the door]
SpongeBob: [climbs onto kitchen counter] Ooh! What does this do? [he pulls on the string of a small cannon located on the counter, launching out two pieces of buttered bread that land on Squidward's face]
Squidward: [moans in anger]
Mr. Krabs: [opens the door for Mrs. Puff who walks into his house] Good evening, my dear. May I say you look lovelier than a stack of twenties.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, Eugene! [Mr. Krabs kisses her arm] You know how I love it when you compare me to folding money.
[in the dining room]
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs takes Mrs. Puff to her seat] Me daughter Pearl will be our server tonight.
Mrs. Puff: [slight gasp] How sweet.
[Mr. Krabs snaps his claws as a signal for Pearl to pour the drink, to which she sighs in irritation. She takes Mr. Krabs' claw and snaps the bottle off with his claws and proceeds to pour it. Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff laugh while Pearl stomps to the kitchen, while continuing to sigh in irritation. Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff drink. Mrs. Puff gets hearts in her eyes, showing her affection for Mr. Krabs.]
Mrs. Puff: [bubbles appear in her eyes as they turn into hearts] [as she burps] Oh, the sparkling sutler is extra fizzy tonight.
Mr. Krabs: Now you just relax, Puffkins, while I consult with me very expensive private chefs. [he walks off to the kitchen nervously]
Mr. Krabs: Alright, hurry up, you cheap slob slingers! Get the dinner on the table! [walks away]
[Squidward goes to the fridge and grabs the vegetables]
Squidward: [as he puts the vegetables on the table for SpongeBob to cook] Here. Even a simpleton like you could make a sal-ad. And it better be fancy. [he throws a spatula at SpongeBob, and he catches it]
SpongeBob: [sweating] Oh, I hope I can make it fancy enough. [smacks the ingredients with a spatula. He then uses a beater to hit the vegetables. He smacks himself with a tomato, and gathers up the ingredients to finish the salads] How's this?
[close-up of the salads is shown, while a heavenly sound effect plays; Pearl groans as she takes the plates]
SpongeBob: Oops! Can't forget the salad dressing. [pours dish soap onto the salads; Pearl walks away]
[Pearl groans as she sets the salads onto the table]
Mr. Krabs: Ah! [licks lips]
Mrs. Puff: Mmm, it looks wonderful.
Mr. Krabs: Huh. It kinda does, doesn't it? [he takes a bite into his salad] Hey, not bad. [he then burps out a soap bubble, and takes away Mrs. Puff's food before she can eat it] But it's not good enough for my Puffykins! [chuckles]
Mrs. Puff: Why, Eugene, how galosh.
Mr. Krabs: I'll just go check on the course. [walks away with the plates]
Mrs. Puff: [stomach rumbling] Oh, my!
[In the kitchen, Mr. Krabs pushes out a bubble from his mouth, which pops and leaves a message in his voice]
Mr. Krabs: [from bubble] What in the name of all that's greasy are you doing in here?! [spoken] Salads ain't supposed to have bubbles! Squidward, you're supposed to be watching him! Don't ruin this dinner for me! [gives SpongeBob and Squidward their salads back and walks away]
Squidward: Just what did you [grabs soap bottle] put on that salad? [squeezes bottle] Oh, good grief, this is dish soap!
SpongeBob: [sniffs salad] I thought those salads had a fresh lemony scent.
Squidward: Go back to cooking, you numbskull!
[scene bubble transitions to Squidward pouring soup into two bowls that Pearl is holding. She takes them back to the table and groans again]
Mr. Krabs: [tries to eat the soup, but his spoon burns up] Huh? [he gasps as he takes Mrs. Puff's bowl away before she can take a bite] Not fancy enough for you! [chuckles]
[a nearby painting's ship burns down from the soup, leaving one fish on a much smaller boat. Pearl then brings two plates of sizzling food]
Mrs. Puff: Ooh. It looks beautiful!
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs' food starts creating smoke] Uh oh. [he shoves both trays of food into his mouth, which soon explode] Still not fancy enough for ya.
[Pearl brings another tray of food. Mrs. Puff picks some of it up with her fork, and the food starts eating the fork]
Mr. Krabs: [hooks the food away from the fork] Uh, still not fancy enough for me fancy lady! [chuckles]
Mrs. Puff: [grabbing onto Mr. Krabs
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, okay, I'll just go check on the main course then. [walks back to the kitchen]
Mrs. Puff: [sighs] Huh? [shrugs and eats the candle on the table]
[back in the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: You two had better come up with something tasty, or you're both double fired!
Squidward: So, we're fired from being fired? Does that mean we're hired?
SpongeBob: Yes!
Mr. Krabs: [growls] Then you're triple fired!
SpongeBob: No.
Mr. Krabs: Just make something edible! [sighs and walks away]
[SpongeBob opens the oven to pick up a new tray of food]
Squidward: [sniffs] Hey, that actually smells tasty.
SpongeBob: [lifting the food up in the air] Hooray! [he tries to catch the food, but it lands on Squidward's head]
Squidward: [wipes away the food, and throws a bunch of oatmeal onto SpongeBob, knocking him down]
[SpongeBob throws spaghetti onto Squidward's head, who growls as he keeps as it on his head. He throws several vegetables at SpongeBob, who gasps and goes up to the cannon]
SpongeBob: Food fight! [uses the cannon to launch lettuce at Squidward, along with several other vegetables]
[Squidward, now on the oven which he uses as a makeshift ship, squirts mustard at SpongeBob. SpongeBob throws flour at Squidward, and then slips off of the cannon from the mustard. He slides into a barrel full of batter, and slides straight into the oven which Squidward had opened]
Squidward: Ah! SpongeBob! [he opens the oven door and pulls SpongeBob out, who has been cooked] Ooh, ooh! Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot! [puts SpongeBob on the plate, and the platter closes on top of him]
[Pearl, on her phone, takes the platter while Squidward cools off his tentacles]
Squidward: Whew. Huh?
[Pearl sets down the giant platter, and groans as she walks away]
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles, hand on platter] Just let me check the quality, my dear.
Mrs. Puff: [violently grabbing Mr. Krabs' claw] Let go of my grub, bub!
Mr. Krabs: [is thrown onto the ground] Whoa!
Mrs. Puff: [throws off the platter to reveal a cooked SpongeBob] Mmm, I'm famished!
Squidward: [whispering to the others] Psst! That's not food! That's SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs: Argh!
[Mrs. Puff tries to stab SpongeBob, who keeps dodging]
Mr. Krabs: We've gotta stop her! [lunges at the table to grab SpongeBob]
Mrs. Puff: Where are you going with my dinner?!
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, go long! [throws SpongeBob to him]
Squidward: I don't want him! [throws SpongeBob to Pearl]
Pearl: Gross!
[Mrs. Puff attacks Pearl, which sends SpongeBob onto the floor. Like a rabid animal, Mrs. Puff dives onto SpongeBob. Close-ups of Mr. Krabs and Pearl screaming are shown, and Squidward just shrugs. Mr. Krabs and Pearl jump onto Pearl, and Squidward reluctantly climbs on top of Pearl. Mrs. Puff inflates, sending everyone else back, and eats SpongeBob whole. She burps, and reverts to her original size]
Mrs. Puff: Ooh. [slurps] That was delicious.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, Puffykins. I don't know how to say this, but...
Mr. Krabs, Squidward, and Pearl: You ate SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob laughs in Mrs. Puff's stomach]
SpongeBob: [inside Mrs. Puff's stomach] Hey, a candle!
Mrs. Puff: Oh, my.
Mr. Krabs: I'm afraid you'll finally have to pass SpongeBob.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, just take me to the doctor.
French Narrator: One operation later...
[at the Krusty Krab. Mrs. Puff is now in a wheelchair, and her stomach is bandaged]
SpongeBob: [singy-songy, lifting the food platter] Dinner is served! [close-up of the large Krabby Patty is shown as a heavenly sound plays] [whispering to Mr. Krabs] Three buns.
Mrs. Puff: [eats the patty] It's perfect.
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: Phew.
Mrs. Puff: [stomach rumbles] But I'm still hungry. [her eyes turn into swirls as she hallucinates SpongeBob turning into the food from earlier, making her lick her lips. In her wheelchair, she heads towards SpongeBob, who runs away screaming. She chases her outside of the Krusty Krab] I just want a taste!
French Narrator: Bon appétit.

Then Mr. Krabs tells Bubble Bass that he will not get any more food until he pays his tab. Bubble Bass tosses a coin, which Mr. Krabs takes. Bubble Bass tries to negotiate another way and invites Mr. Krabs to a friendly game of three deadly challenges of a tabulation game (of castles). SpongeBob is thrilled with the idea, but Mr. Krabs rejects the board game, causing Bubble Bass to run away. Squidward says Bubble Bass is gone because in his own words, they would never see that game geek again. A voice is heard through the drive-thru speaker saying he wants 50 Krabby Patties with extra pickles. This voice is from Bubble Bass, and SpongeBob is about to give him the Krabby Patties, but Mr. Krabs finds out. Bubble Bass provokes Mr. Krabs by dancing at the drive-thru window until a car honks at him. Mr. Krabs sends Squidward and SpongeBob to Bubble Bass's house to collect his tab.Squidward opens a door to Bubble Bass's house, which SpongeBob is surprised by and praises by saying that he is very strong. SpongeBob and Squidward decide to look for Bubble Bass, but they cannot find him, so they decide to sell the furniture in the house. Bubble Bass tells them to stop destroying his mother's furniture, and they can work it out in the basement. Bubble Bass tells them that if they want him to pay, they need to play the 3 deadly challenges. SpongeBob looks for the game and, upon finding it, tells Bubble Bass that they will play his game. The two enter through the hatch and realize that there is a real version of the 3 Deadly Challenges (made of boxes). The first challenge begins: they both attack Bubble Bass and try to tap him out. Squidward tries to land a blow and hits Bubble Bass, but his belly blocks the attack. The boxes collapse and SpongeBob and Squidward fall, decapitating Bubble Bass, revealing that the Bubble Bass that Squidward tried to attack was not the real Bubble Bass, but a doll (made with Bubble Bass' mom's sofa cushions and sleeping bag). Bubble Bass starts insulting them after SpongeBob does the same, then the second challenge begins: fighting a bull. They both go to the Duel Arena, find a box and a red scarf, and the box starts making bull noises. Bubble Bass' mother comes out of the box and rages like a bull (because Bubble Bass told his mother that the furniture in the house was chipped by SpongeBob and Squidward), so the two try to hide behind the cloth, but Bubble Bass' mother still attacks them. In the middle of the fight, Mama Bass and Squidward begin to dance the tango, while SpongeBob is fond of it, but suddenly Mama Bass's watch beeps and she tells Squidward that she has to go to a bake sale and to call her. Bubble Bass, when he sees that his mother left, yells ""Why?!"" as the cardboard stage collapses.Then follows the third and final challenge: the joust. Bubble Bass prepares to fight Squidward. When SpongeBob is about to give Squidward his shield, Squidward tells him that he does not need it, while SpongeBob says ""My hero!."" Bubble Bass and Squidward charge to attack each other. Squidward uses his spear and uses so much force that he thrusts it into Bubble Bass's belly button, defeating him. Squidward and SpongeBob approach Bubble Bass and tell him that now he must pay his bill, but Bubble Bass tells them that he spent all his money on the cardboard boxes, so Squidward tells him that Sir Krabs (Mr. Krabs) will know how to fix this.In the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs puts Bubble Bass to work to pay his bill, but Bubble Bass keeps complaining about work, annoying customers in different ways. The clients, angered by Bubble Bass, go directly to Mr. Krabs' office to pay him everything that Bubble Bass owes so that he can leave immediately. Mr. Krabs, already with the Bubble Bass account paid, goes to Bubble Bass, who was washing the dishes in the toilet, and tells him that his bill is already paid and that he can leave, Bubble Bass comes out of the bathroom happily. To Mr. Krabs' surprise and dismay, Bubble Bass does not leave, but instead orders a bunch more food and tells Mr. Krabs that he just opened a new account and goes on top of his cardboard horse, so Mr. Krabs furiously chases after Bubble Bass. Suddenly, SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen with a rose in his mouth and dances the tango with Squidward, but suddenly Mama Bass asks him if she can dance too, to which Squidward says yes. The episode ends with Mama Bass and Squidward dancing the tango and leaving the Krusty Krab.",Bubble Bass's Tab,"[The episode starts at the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: One large Flatsom fries. Extra jetsam. [drops it on the tray] Four orders of duckweed. [drops it on the tray]
Bubble Bass: Hmm. Methinks thou forgot my gravy, thou lumpish clay-brained flap dragon.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Flap dragon. [giggles]
Squidward: [sighs] Oh, and finally, one Deep Sea Donut. [drops it on the tray] That comes to a total of-
Bubble Bass: Whatever the measure, squire, put it on my account.
Mr. Krabs: [peeks in from tray] Oh, no, you don't. No more food for you until you pay your tab. [rolls out a long check]
Bubble Bass: P-p-p-ay t-t-t-t-tab? [reaches into his pocket and grabs a coin] I'll flip you for it. [flips the coin]
Mr. Krabs: [grabs the coin] I'll take that.
Bubble Bass: [pulls a game from his pants] How about a friendly game of Three Deadly Challenges?
SpongeBob: Oh, castle! Pick castle!
Mr. Krabs: Oh... [slaps the game out of Bubble Bass' hands]
Bubble Bass: [runs out of building]
Squidward: [laughs] I bet we'll never see that game geek again.
Bubble Bass: [through the drive thru speaker] 50 Krabby Patties, please. Extra pickles. [at the drive thru window] Put it on my tab.
SpongeBob: [walks up to the drive thru window to deliver food to Bubble Bass] Coming right up!
Mr. Krabs: [yelling] Bubble Bass! You...
Bubble Bass: [singing/taunting] Hey, nonny nonny! You look pretty funny! You won't get my money! [starts rubbing his butt on drive thru window] Nah nah nah nah nah!
[A dad in his car honks his horn, causing Bubble Bass to run away.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward! I want you and SpongeBob to go after Bubble Bass, and collect his tab! [gives the tab to Squidward]
SpongeBob: [squeals]
Squidward: Blech.
[Bubble transition to Bubble Bass' house, where SpongeBob and Squidward are about to arrive at.]
SpongeBob: [singing] Hey, nonny nonny! You look pretty funny! You won't get my money! [stops singing] I can't help it. It's catchy.
Squidward: Look, I just want to collect the money as soon as possible and go. Bubble Bass, we're here to collect your tab! [kicks down the door]
SpongeBob: Squidward, that was so masculine.
Squidward: Heh. Well, I... Let's go. [he and SpongeBob walk into Bubble Bass' house] I know you're in here. Come out!
SpongeBob: [sniffs] Hmm. Smells funny in here.
[Bubble Bass appears as a moose head on the wall before popping back into the wall.]
Squidward: Smells like deadbeat. Hmm. [shouting] If you don't pay up, we'll... sell this furniture. [holds up a nearby chair and drops it, damaging the corner; SpongeBob gasps] Whoops. How much do you think this is worth? I just chipped it.
SpongeBob: Oh, it was the chip that sold me! [holds out a dollar bill] I'll give you ten bucks.
Bubble Bass: [from basement] Hey! Don't touch mother's things! I'll pay the tab! Come downstairs, and we'll work it out. [he pulls the carpet, causing SpongeBob and Squidward to painfully fall down the stairs into the basement]
SpongeBob: [lands in Squidward's lap] My savior.
Squidward: [rolls SpongeBob off his lap] Alright, where is he?
Bubble Bass: [from underground room; hatch opens] If you want me to pay, you'll have to play the Three Deadly Challenges!
SpongeBob: [jumps into the air] Oh! The Three Deadly Challenges! I got this game! [opens up his body, revealing a shelf of board games] Where is it? Game of Strife, Chutes and Bladders... Oh, here it is! [pulls out Three Deadly Challenges and closes his body] Ah! The Three Deadly Challenges!
Squidward: A board game. Whoopee.
SpongeBob: [shouting] Okay, Bubble Bass! We accept the challenge!
Squidward: Why are you giving him the upper hand? He owes us money!
SpongeBob: Oh. But I wanna pway the Thwee Deadwy Chawenges.
Squidward: Oh, all wight al- [clears throat] -alright already! Let's get this over with!
SpongeBob: Oh yeah! [Squidward kicks him into underground cellar as SpongeBob laughs]
Squidward: Oh, boy. [climbs ladder into cellar]
[in the cellar]
SpongeBob: Wow. A life-size version of the Three Deadly Challenges. Beautiful.
Squidward: Looks like a hobo campground.
SpongeBob: No, Squidward. You have to look with your imagination. [waves his hand across the screen, revealing a more fantasy-like landscape]
Squidward: What the? No! [ruins the fantasy landscape with his tentacles] It's a dump!
Bubble Bass: Thou art two oozing cysts on the hind side of a plague dog's nose.
Squidward: What did he say?
SpongeBob: The colorful insults are the best part of the game.
Squidward: That figures. Hmm. [walks to where Bubble Bass is along with SpongeBob] So how do you win this goofball game, anyway?
SpongeBob: Since Bubble Bass challenged us, all we have to do is get close enough to tag him out. We get three chances, or should I say three challenges.
Squidward: Oh. [grunts]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! [he and Squidward grab a sword] Look, Squidward! [slashes with a cardboard sword a few times]
Squidward: Oh, this feels stupid. [sighs]
SpongeBob and Squidward: Charge!
[SpongeBob and Squidward charge up the cardboard mountain. Squidward yells as he hit Bubble Bass' belly with the sword.]
Squidward: Hmm? [the mountain starts shaking] Uh oh.
[SpongeBob grabs onto Squidward as the structure falls down. They both scream as they crash to the ground. A crowd cheering sound effect plays from a speaker.]
Squidward: [tags what he assumes to be Bubble Bass] Tag, you lose! [laughs along with SpongeBob, but accidentally rips apart the decoy. SpongeBob screams]
SpongeBob: We decapitated him!
Squidward: Oh, calm down. It's just a dummy he made from his mother's couch cushions and a sleeping bag. [sighs] All of this for a tab?
SpongeBob: Oh! But you were magnificent, Squidward. So strong and courageous.
Squidward: [pushing SpongeBob back] As always.
Bubble Bass: Thy canker sore bottoms curdle seaweed and sour the ocean.
Squidward: Oh, you-
SpongeBob: [getting up] I got this one, Squidward. Oh, yeah? Well, your pillows are filled with urchins, [pulling on Squidward's shirt and letting go] and your shirts are inside out!
Squidward: [rubbing his nose] Adding injury to insult.
[Trumpet fanfare plays as SpongeBob and Squidward enter a cardboard arena.]
Squidward: Oh... [the speaker plays a cheering sound effect again] Oh, look at all this junk.
SpongeBob: [excitedly] I know. Isn't it great?
Squidward: [pulls on his nose] Let's finish this. [grabs a red cloth] He's obviously in that bullpen.
[The box makes huffing and growling noises. Mama Bass hops out like a bull, and roars at SpongeBob and Squidward, launching spit at their faces.]
SpongeBob and Squidward: Bubble Bass' mom!
Mama Bass: You! You chipped my furniture! [she growls as she gets ready to charge at them]
Squidward: He tricked us. What do we do?
SpongeBob: Hide! [he pulls the cloth over him and Squidward, both whimpering]
Mama Bass: [close-up of her eyes turning into tablecloths] And that's my good tablecloth! [tire squealing is heard as she charges towards SpongeBob and Squidward, attacking them in a fighting cloud]
[Mama Bass repeatedly jumps on top of the two of them, then starts crushing them with her individual buttocks. They get into another fighting cloud, and Mama Bass slams SpongeBob and Squidward together. The fighting cloud reappears, and she bites on Squidward's legs, making him scream. The fighting cloud reappears again, and this time she does a tango dance with Squidward. Mama Bass shoves a rose into Squidward's mouth.]
SpongeBob: Aww!
[Eventually, an alarm on Mama Bass' watch goes off.]
Mama Bass: Huh? [lets go of Squidward] Sorry, sweetie. Gotta run. [walks off] I'm late for the bake sale. Call me!
[Squidward pulls the collar of his shirt, sweating, and gulps.]
Bubble Bass: [in the crowd] Mother! Why?!
[Bubble Bass' screaming causes the cardboard crowd to fall down. Medieval fanfare plays from the speaker. Squidwars is reeled downward by SpongeBob by a crank. SpongeBob gets tired, and accidentally lets go of the crank causing Squidward to fall down onto a cardboard seahorse. SpongeBob slides over to give him a lance.]
SpongeBob: Sir Squidward, you look magnificent upon your mighty steed. [he waves his hand across the screen again, recreating the fantasy landscape]
Squidward: [gasps] Yes. Yes, I see it now!
Bubble Bass: [lands on the ground] Any last words, Squid-wuss?
Squidward: May thy fat head be set upon by sea spiders and torn asunder, leaving only thine eyes to witness the humiliation!
Bubble Bass: Ooh, pretty good last words.
SpongeBob: [handing Squidward a shield] Sir Squidward, thy shield.
Squidward: Ha! Shield, shmield. [knocks the shield away with his lance]
SpongeBob: My hero.
[The speaker plays the cheering sound again, and Squidward and Bubble Bass look at each other, grunting as each of them get a cinematic close-up. SpongeBob blows into the giant horn and falls off the boxes. Squidward and Bubble Bass charge at each other, and SpongeBob covers his face with his costume.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I can't look! [his eyes rip out of the costume]
[Squidward and Bubble Bass continue charging at each other.]
Bubble Bass: Mommy!
[Squidward's lance deeply penetrates Bubble Bass' belly, sending him back and causing him to fall to the floor.]
Squidward: [punches Bubble Bass' face with his lance] Alright, Bubble Bass. You're tagged. Pay your tab.
[SpongeBob mocks Bubble Bass with the tab.]
Bubble Bass: You bested me at Three Deadly Challenges. But I am broke! Verily, I spent all of my money on cardboard. [a piece of cardboard falls down] What are you going to do to me?
Squidward: Nothing, but I am sure Mr. Krabs has some Deadly Challenges of his own for you.
[The scene bubble transitions to the Krusty Krab, where Bubble Bass is mopping the floor.]
Bubble Bass: This is torture! My arms are killing me. I can't feel my fingers. [letting go of the mop and clenching his right arm] I feel a cramp! I'm cramped! [leaps up, and his butt touches a customer's Krabby Patty] My back is breaking. [the patty's ketchup squirts into a child's face, making him cry, and the customer takes him away angrily. Bubble Bass faceplants into the mop bucket] Oh...
[Several customers are complaining to Mr. Krabs.]
Customers: That guy is terrible! [more overlapping dialogue]
Mr. Krabs: Look, I sympathize. He's gotta work here until he pays off his tab.
Fred: I've got some money. [lays money on Mr. Krabs' desk]
Woman: I'll contribute to that.
[The child from earlier grabs a hammer and breaks his piggy bank on the desk.]
Mr. Krabs: What? That's not- I didn't really- oh- oh. [gasps as he sees several customers giving him money to pay off the tab]
Old man: Just get that menace out of here!
[Mr. Krabs walks over to the restroom with the money, humming. Bubble Bass is cleaning the restroom toilet, mumbling to himself as he flushes the toilet.]
Bubble Bass: Hmm?
Mr. Krabs: Alright, Bubble Bass. Your tab's been wiped clean. [rips apart the tab] You can go. [Bubble Bass stares at him] Well? Go already!
Bubble Bass: [running past Mr. Krabs, making him spin] Verily, I am free-ith! [giggles]
Mr. Krabs: [gets dizzy, and gets up. He giggles as he counts the money. He then hears the cash register ding] Huh? [walks out]
[Mr. Krabs' jaw literally drops as he sees Squidward giving Bubble Bass four bags of Krusty Krab food.]
Bubble Bass: [imitates a horse] Krabs! I thank thee, clapper-clawed barnacle, for forgiving my debt. And FYI, I just opened up a [close-up of his face] new tab. [squeals and laughs as he walks away] Hi-ya!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Bubble Bass! [runs toward Bubble Bass, who is laughing while running away]
[Squidward laughs. SpongeBob exits the kitchen with a rose in his mouth.]
SpongeBob: [takes the rose out of his mouth] Ole, Señor Squidward?
[Squidward jumps out the boat, and holds his arm out to SpongeBob.]
Squidward: Ole, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob puts the rose back into his mouth, twirls, and then starts dancing with Squidward.]
Squidward: I'll lead.
Mama Bass: [pokes Squidward's arm] May I?
[Mama Bass giggles whilst looking at Squidward.]
Squidward: Eh, but of course. [he and Mama Bass dance. SpongeBob eats the rose, and the episode ends with Squidward and Mama Bass dancing out of the Krusty Krab]",0.48,Kaz

She tells Plankton she put up fliers for an intern, which leads many people to apply, but they leave after they hear about the sub-minimum wage portion. Patrick applies and tells Plankton that he wants to handle the science equipment, and proceeds to enter Plankton's Duplo Maker. Plankton instructs Patrick to place a coin inside the machine, but he walks inside the machine and creates countless clones of himself. Plankton kicks Patrick and his clones out of the Chum Bucket, and gets upset because no applicants are left.Suddenly, Pearl shows up at the Chum Bucket and applies for an internship. Plankton is initially frightened by Pearl, but he grants her the internship after he realizes that she wants to help. After she accepts the job, Plankton decides to show off his new inventions. Unfortunately, all of his inventions fail and create gigantic messes. Plankton forces Pearl to clean the restaurant each time his inventions fail, which annoys her a lot.At home, Mr. Krabs asks Pearl about her day. When Pearl complains and says that Plankton doesn't let her do any of the ""fun stuff,"" Mr. Krabs tells her that a good employee always follows the boss' orders. She takes her father's advice and decides to continue working for Plankton.The next day, Pearl visits the Chum Bucket and wishes Plankton a good morning. When Pearl asks Plankton if she can help with Plankton's science experiments, he asks her if she can materialize a Krabby Patty. Pearl says she can't do that, but proceeds to tell Plankton that she can give him the Krabby Patty secret formula because Mr. Krabs is her father. Plankton is very surprised by Pearl's statement and he decides to give her a promotion. He proceeds to ask Pearl if she is free to attend a conference later that night, and she says ""Oh yes."" Pearl goes home and prepares for her extra shift.Later that night, Pearl thanks Mr. Krabs for the advice and leaves her home to begin her extra shift. Pearl and Plankton proceed to sneak into the Krusty Krab, and they encounter SpongeBob ""sleep cooking."" When Plankton jumps on top of SpongeBob repeatedly, he hits Plankton with a spatula and places him inside a Krabby Patty.

When he questions his daughter about the situation, she explains that she was simply following her dad's advice. Mr. Krabs becomes annoyed at himself due to his ""big mouth,"" so he tries to coerce Pearl into giving him back the formula. Pearl agrees to give her dad the formula back under one condition... Mr. Krabs has to triple her allowance. He reluctantly agrees, and Pearl gives Plankton a good old fashioned launch back to the Chum Bucket via her blowhole.

Plankton: Karen, can you give me a hand with my new Dodanatron?
Karen: Sorry Sheldon, I'm off to visit my Motherboard. [she leaves the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: [gasps, runs after Karen] Wait! How am I supposed to get anything done without you?
Karen: Don't worry, I put up Help Wanted flyers for an intern. See? [Karen throws intern flyer, and it flies until it hits Plankton's eye]
Plankton: [sees flyer] Ooh. ""INTERN WANTED."" Apply today at Chum Bucket Labs? [crumbles flyer] I'm a mad scientist! If getting help was that easy, I wouldn't have built a computer wife!
Person: Is this where I apply for the intern job?

Plankton: Ahem. Hello and welcome to Chum Bucket Labs. As an intern, you will gain valuable work experience and a sub-minimum wage. [the crowd sighs and leaves, leaving only Patrick] Well that narrowed it down.
Patrick: I wanna do the science!
Plankton: [quietly] Oh boy.

Plankton: Okay, let's see how ya handle scientific equipment. This is my Duplo Maker! It's very, very simple.
Patrick: Oh, like me!
Plankton: [takes out a coin] Just put this coin in the chamber-
Patrick: Gotcha! [grabs the coin and squishes Plankton]
Plankton: Ow! No! Just the coin, you idiot! [he gasps as Patrick steps inside the machine]

Plankton: Oh.
Patrick clones: Do we get the job?
Plankton: I'll tell ya what ya get. [takes out a remote] You get out! [pushes the button on the remote, and a robot hand with a glove smacks the Patrick clones out of the Chum Bucket]

Patrick clone #2: No, I'm Patrick.
Patrick clone #3: Who's Patrick?
Plankton: Well, great. Not a single applicant left.
Pearl: Hello? I'm still here.

Pearl: I don't eat Plankton. That's baby food. I'm just here for the job.
Plankton: Really? You're not gonna eat me?
Pearl: Eww, no! I just need money, but my dad's such a skinflint with my allowance.
Plankton: Alright, you're hired. Whatever.
[Bubble transition to next scene at the Chum Bucket.]
Plankton: As the junior intern of Chum Bucket Labs, you're responsible for extremely important tasks.
Pearl: Oh wow! Like what? [Plankton is then seen standing on Pearl to reach for a high-up object] Ugh.
Plankton: [screws a lightbulb onto a robot] You make an excellent ladder, junior intern. [he finishes screwing in the lightbulb] Yes! My evil robot is complete! [he jumps up onto it and goes inside it. The robot comes alive and starts walking shortly after] Nothing can stop me now! [he tries squeezing through a door but is too big to do so. The robot sputters and explodes. Plankton, still inside the robot's intact head, comes rolling towards Pearl. A tiny door on the head opens, revealing him]
Pearl: Except that tiny doorway.
Plankton: No one asked you, junior intern. And by the way, [he holds up something] I forgot you give you your very own lab instrument.
Pearl: [she holds the object] Ooh! What's it do? [the object unfolds, revealing it to be a broom and Pearl is launched across the room]

Plankton: Observe, my lonely intern, and tremble at the power of my mighty, uh, laser thingy. [he takes a curtain off his large invention] It'll blow the door off a safe. [he presses a red button on the invention. A tiny hand holding a laser gun comes out and shoots the gun.]

Pearl: Tentacles.
Plankton: Their tentacles, even worse! [laughs evilly]
[the monster grabs Plankton and throws him directly onto the laser machine.]

Plankton: You're gonna need a mop.
[Bubble transition to the next scene; Pearl groans as she walks over to her house]
Pearl: Oh...
Mr. Krabs: Aww, how was your day at your first summer job, sweetie?
Pearl: It's so boring. My boss doesn't let me do any of the fun stuff.
Mr. Krabs: Now, now, my little cetacean. Work ain't supposed to be fun.
Pearl: But daddy, my boss is-
Mr. Krabs: Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, it don't matter who your boss is. A good employee follows the boss' orders.
Pearl: If you say so, daddy.
[The scene cuts to the dawn of the next day at the Chum Bucket. The scene then goes to the Chum Bucket lab.]
Plankton: I'll just power up the ol' rectifier. Install the free-range poultry, [he inserts a literal chicken breast as chicken sounds play] plus a final adjustment.
[Plankton is about to turn a knob on the machine, but then Pearl arrives with her stomping.]
Pearl: Morning, Boss!
Plankton: Watch it! This instrument is very delicate!
Pearl: Can I help with a cool science stuff today, Mr. Plankton? Please?
Plankton: Can you materialize me a Krabby Patty, Junior Intern?
Pearl: No.
Plankton: Didn't think so.
Pearl: But I can give you the recipe.
Plankton: What? [smiles] You can get me Krabs' secret formula?
Pearl: Well, he is my dad.
Plankton: Eugene Krabs is your father?
Pearl: Duh. Everyone knows that.
Plankton: Are you free to attend a conference tonight, Senior Intern?
Pearl: Oh, yes! [violently shakes Plankton's hand]

Plankton: Overlord to Flunky, come in Flunky.
Pearl: Flunky here. I read you overlord. Over.
Plankton: Give me a boost up to the window. Over.
Pearl: You got it, boss. Over.
[Pearl tries jumping to the window, but accidentally launches Plankton upwards instead.]
Pearl: Oops.
[Plankton lands inside the top pipe of the Krusty Krab, and he falls straight to the ground of the kitchen. Pearl unlocks and opens the back door to the kitchen]
Plankton: Oooh! Ahem.
Pearl: I forgot I had a spare key.
Plankton: [groans] Come on.
[they both gasp as they see a shadowy figure moving from the door window]
Plankton: [whispering] Somebody's coming. Hide!
[Plankton shoves Pearl into the cabinet and they both hide. SpongeBob walks into the kitchen.]
Plankton: [opens cabinet doors] That perforated peabrain should be home in bed! Let's get outta here! [he tries to flee, but Pearl catches him by the antennae]
Pearl: Wait, I think SpongeBob's sleep cooking.
[SpongeBob is snoring, and uses his spatula as if he is flipping Krabby Patties]
Plankton: [jumps on top of SpongeBob] SpongeBoob is even more oblivious than usual. [repeatedly opening and closing SpongeBob's eyelids] Look, he has no idea what's going on.
[Plankton laughs and slides down SpongeBob's nose. He then starts bouncing on his nose.]
Plankton: [grunts] Hey, hey, hey! [cackles]
Pearl: Shh! You're gonna wake him up!
[Plankton continues to bounce on SpongeBob's nose laughing until SpongeBob grabs him.]
Plankton: Huh? [SpongeBob smacks him onto the grill] Oww!
[Muffled whimpers come from Plankton as SpongeBob hits him with his spatula. Pearl groans over the sounds.]
Plankton: Over. [SpongeBob hits him some more. Plankton whimpers as SpongeBob puts salt, pepper and cheese on him and flips him onto the bottom bun he is holding. He then squirts mayonnaise on the cheese] Mayonnaise? Eww! [SpongeBob puts on the top bun, squashing Plankton. He exits the kitchen]
SpongeBob: [snores] Order up...
[Pearl dashes out the kitchen, grabs SpongeBob and the patty, and throws SpongeBob into the trash can. SpongeBob continues snoring inside the trash can. Plankton lifts up the burger contents.]
Plankton: Huh. [throws the contents away] Why didn't I think of that? [cut to Pearl and Plankton emerging from the cashier boat]
SpongeBob: [wakes up and yawns inside the trash can] Where am I? [He pops out of the trash can and notices Plankton and Pearl, causing him to gasp.] Plankton. [he hops over to the phone and dials Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Money? I mean. Hello?
SpongeBob: [with his tongue] Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: I'm not singing anymore lullabies, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: No, I'm at the Krusty Krab! Plankton and a giant goon are trying to steal the secret formula!
Mr. Krabs: Me formuler?! I'll be right there, boy-o!
Plankton: Ooh, what's your plan to open the safe? Power drill? Explosives? The large Hadda collider?
Pearl: Nah, I'll just use the combination. [starts inputting the combination]
Plankton: Diabolical!
[Pearl opens the safe and grabs the formula]
Plankton: I can almost taste that Krabby Patty now. The formula is mine.
Mr. Krabs: [turns on the lights] You'll have to get past me first, Plankton.
Plankton: Krabs!
SpongeBob: And you'll have to get past me too. [he punches his fists together, and hurts his hand] Ow.
Mr. Krabs: Tell your giant goon to hand over me formuler, Plankton!
Pearl: Daddy, [takes off her disguise] I'm a flunky, not a goon.
Mr. Krabs: Stay out of this, Pearl. Pearl?! What are you doing with me bitter enemy?!
Pearl: Working for Plankton is my summer job. I was just doing what you said. Remember? A good employee follows their boss's orders. [teases Plankton with the formula bottle]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, but-but-but, not when your boss is- Oh, [facepalms] me and my big mouth. Honey, you don't have to work for this loser. Give Papa the formuler, and you can come work for me.
Plankton: [jabs Mr. Krabs in the stomach] You're too late, Krabs. Your daughter works for me now.
Pearl: I'll give you the formula back, daddy, on one condition. Triple my allowance, so I don't have to work for anyone this summer.
Mr. Krabs: Tri-tri-tri-triple?! [Pearl is still teasing Plankton with the formula bottle] Oh, alright...
[Pearl gives Mr. Krabs the formula bottle]
Pearl: Sorry, Mr. Plankton, but I quit! [grabs Plankton and puts him in her mouth]
Plankton: Sweet Neptune! She is gonna eat me!
[Pearl shuts her mouth, and uses her blowhole to shoot Plankton out of the same pipe he came from. Plankton screams.]
Plankton: [stops screaming momentarily] You can forget that letter of recommendation. [lands in the Chum Bucket]

He checks the bell near him, the telephone, the fireplace, and inside him, only to still hear ringing. As he is about to run out of the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs catches him and tells him that the ringing he was hearing was coming from a small bell that he uses to bring in customers.Mr. Krabs uses the bell on several customers, including Incidental 6, in which he then drools on the table in wanting another Krabby Patty. When SpongeBob asks to ring the bell, Mr. Krabs offers him to ring the big bell from the roof. The bell's ring results in people all over Bikini Bottom drooling for Krabby Patties and heading towards the Krusty Krab.As the customers are enjoying their Krabby Patties, Patrick suddenly bursts into the restaurant and throws a tantrum on the floors, causing the customers to leave. SpongeBob calms Patrick down by rubbing jelly on him. When asked what he recently remembers, Patrick gives a flashback to an experience he had as a kid, in which his parents ring a bell to get Patrick to take a bath. In the flashback, he cries out of not wanting one. After the flashback ends, SpongeBob proclaims that he will silence every bell in town, as he smashes through the Krusty Krab roof.Mr. Krabs decides to use Patrick's tantrums to his advantage by encouraging him to participate in a fighting match against Harry the Health Hazard for $1 million. While Mr. Krabs and Patrick watch on at the stadium, SpongeBob deactivates more ringing bells across Bikini Bottom. Back at the stadium, Mr. Krabs puts Patrick in the arena for the match. A bell rings to signal the start of the match, which results in Patrick going crazy. While in his rampage, Patrick, unintentionally, actually fights Harry and ends up hurting him. After Harry is defeated, Mr. Krabs uses jelly to calm Patrick down. Just when the fight is declared over, another bell rings, which results in Patrick throwing Mr. Krabs out of the stadium with another tantrum.Back at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is seen wearily walking into the restaurant, with Patrick having won a trophy for winning the fight. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is about to put the money he won into the cash register, but a ring goes off when he presses the button, which results in Patrick going crazy again. He ends up destroying the restaurant and rips up Mr. Krabs' money. Patrick's parents come in and praise him for the result of the fight. SpongeBob tells them about how ringing a bell has affected Patrick, but they say they have never used a bell. Hearing this, Patrick finally stops to question this and his father reveals he misinterpreted the sound as they actually squeezed a rubber duck to get him to take his bath. Patrick squeezing the duck causes him to have a tantrum again, as the episode ends.",Patrick's Tantrum,"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab with the kitchen's bell ringing.]
SpongeBob: [sets a Krabby Patty on the kitchen window] Okay, okay, order up. [notices that the bell is still ringing. He picks up the phone on the wall] Uh, hello, Krusty kitchen- Hmm? [the bell is still ringing. His eyes go through the telephone, then go to the fireplace] Hello? It sounds like... sleigh bells! [his body goes into the fireplace] Is that you, Santa Claus? [his head gets splatted with ink, resembling Ringo Starr of The Beatles] [speaking in a Liverpudlian accent] I can still hear the ring... go. [randomly pops an ear out from his body as his two eyes go in them] Hmm. No bells in here. Uh, this is serious. [runs to the front door]
Mr. Krabs: [whistling and grabs SpongeBob] And just where do you think you're going during business hours?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs, but I got to see an ear doctor. I've been hearing a ringing in my ears all week.
Mr. Krabs: Hold your seahorses, boy-o. You don't have tinnit-er-us.
SpongeBob: I don't?
Mr. Krabs: No. [gets a small bell] I've been ringing this bell all week, and doing it to condition the customers. Whenever they hear the bell, [rings the bell] they'll hunger for a Krabby Patty, and come straight to the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Oh! I don't get it.
Mr. Krabs: Observe. First, I'll condition them while they're eating.
[Mr. Krabs rings bell in front of Incidental 7, who is eating a Krabby Patty.]
Incidental 7: Beat it, Quasimodo.
[Mr. Krabs rings the bell in front of another family at the Krusty Krab.]
Blue fish: I'm gonna go bop that guy.
Brown fish: Now, now, honey. Think of the children.
Blue fish: Oh, you're right, dear. What was I thinking? Kids, go bop that guy.
[The two kids jump up and attack Mr. Krabs, but Mr. Krabs moves away from them. He walks up to Tom.]
Tom: [burps]
Mr. Krabs: Now this guy's heard the bell before. Watch him when I ring it.
[Mr. Krabs rings the bell in front of Tom. His brain turns into the shape of a Krabby Patty in response.]
Tom: [starts drooling all over the table] I want another Krabby Patty. [notices he's drooling] And a bucket for my saliva.
SpongeBob: [jumps around] Oh, an I ring the little bell? Can I? Can I? Can I?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you can do better than that, boy-o. You can ring the big bell.
[Mr. Krabs stomps on the ground, revealing a rope.]
SpongeBob: Oh!
[SpongeBob tries pulling on the rope, but it is too heavy. Mr. Krabs gives him an assist and he starts ringing the bell. The bell sound spreads to all of Bikini Bottom.]

Patrick: [continues to throw tantrum]
Mr. Krabs: What the halibut is wrong with you, boy?
[Patrick uses his legs to throw Mr. Krabs at Squidward and continues to throw a tantrum.]
Mr. Krabs: [emerges from Squidward's station] He's lost his mind!
Squidward: He never had a mind.
SpongeBob: Oh, I've seen this before. I know what to do! [jumps through order window and jumps onto Patrick, rubbing jellyfish jelly on him. This causes Patrick to calm down] When Patrick has a tantrum like this, jellyfish jelly on the belly is the only thing that calms him down. Then when he comes out of it, he hardly remembers a thing.
Patrick: [stands up and calms down]
SpongeBob: Hey buddy, feel better? What's the last thing you remember?
Patrick: Uh, I remember hearing a bell ring. [flashback to when Patrick was a kid] When I was a little sea star, and it was time for my bath, my parents would always ring a bell.
Herb Star: [ringing a bell] It's bath time, son!
Patrick: [narrating] I didn't want a bath. [flashback Patrick starts having a tantrum, and flashback ends] After that, the only thing I remember is nothing.
SpongeBob: Then it's time for me to be proactive and help my buddy here. I am going to silence every ding dong bell in town. Starting with... [rushes over the counter and smashes the ordering bell on the window] Yah! This one. [pulls the rope very hard, making the large bell fall on the ground, breaking it in half] And this one.
Mr. Krabs: Wait. How'd you get so strong all of a sudden?
SpongeBob: [dressed as a superhero] Through the power of friendship! [Patrick applauds him] Look out, bells of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob is about to silence every ring, chime, buzz, and jingle jangle! [leaps into the air, smashing through the Krusty Krab's roof and flies off]
Patrick: [teary eyed] There goes a dear darling dude.
Mr. Krabs: [sadly] There goes my brilliant bell business. [to Patrick] You know, Pat-o, I was studying your impressive moves during your little, um... [pauses for a moment] Acrimony.
Patrick: My little macaroni?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, that's right. And I believe that I have a way to make back all the money I'm gonna lose. [he holds up a poster of Harry the Health Hazzard] One million dollars to the challenger that can beat Harry the Health Hazzard in Supreme Fighting.
Patrick: [laughs and proceeds to take a bite of the poster, then claps]

Wrestler: No! Not the pretzel!

Patrick: [spectating, licking his lips. His stomach growls] That reminds me. I'm still hungry. Got any more posters?
Mr. Krabs: [hands Patrick a bag of posters] Knock yourself out. We're gonna be rolling in posters!
Patrick: [laughs and starts eating the posters]

SpongeBob: For my buddy Patrick! [jumps down]
[The nearby building lights on fire, and several citizens run away screaming. The scene cuts to a boy on his tricycle, ringing the bell on it. SpongeBob rips the bell off of his bike, smashes it to the ground, and replaces it with a TV of a chimpanzee. The kid gives him a thumbs up as he continues riding his tricycle.]
SpongeBob: [saluting] For my buddy Patrick! [runs in the other direction]
[The scene cuts to SpongeBob at Mrs. Puff's house, replacing her wind chimes with hot dogs, which make a mooing sound when hit.]
SpongeBob: For my buddy Patrick! [runs off]

Mr. Krabs: [walking Patrick down the stairs] Okay, Patrick. It's go time!
Patrick: [mouth full of posters] Are we changing our seats?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, I got you the best seat in the house. [throws Patrick onto a stool in the wrestling ring]
Patrick: Ooh, this is the best seat in the house! It's like 3-D. I can almost reach out and [touches the referee's butt] touch the referee!
Referee: [slaps Patrick] Hey!
Patrick: Ow!
Referee: [on the microphone] Our next victim, uh, challenger, is... [reads from a paper] Patrick Star!
Patrick: [laughing and pointing at the referee] That next victim has the same name as me.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, crazy, right? [walks away]
[The wrestling bell goes off, triggering Patrick to have another tantrum.]
Referee: Well, it looks like the challenger is doing a good job fighting with himself.
Harry the Health Hazzard: [walking up to Patrick] Hmm? [Patrick spins and hits him into the corner, giving him Patrick dizzy stars]
[Mr. Krabs laughs as he watches the fight. Patrick jumps out of his pants and starts sliding along the ground in a circle. Harry the Health Hazzard shakes his head and foams at the mouth, angry at Patrick. He attempts to tackle Patrick, but Patrick kicks him back, flinging him back into Patrick, who flings into Harry. The two continue this cycle until they collide with each other. Patrick sews a spot on Harry's tights, then twists him into a pretzel, puts salt on him, and takes a bite out of him. He throws Harry backward, and continues to have a tantrum. Mr. Krabs comes onto the ring and tackles him, spreading jellyfish jelly onto Patrick's belly, calming him down.]
Referee: Well, folks, it looks like the fight's over.
Patrick: What happened?
Mr. Krabs: I just became rich! [wrestling bell rings again, re-triggering Patrick to throw a tantrum] Uh-oh. [he gets launched out of the stadium by Patrick]
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob walking to the Krusty Krab, exhausted.]
SpongeBob: [tired] For my buddy Patrick. [Patrick is shown eating a poster, holding a winner trophy] I did it, pal. I silenced every bell in town so that you will no longer have a tantrum, buddy.
Patrick: Aww. [picks up SpongeBob] Thank you, best friend. [hugs SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: [injured, holding money] I don't care about bells ringing or conditioning customers anymore, 'cause I've got a million dollars! [laughs as he puts the money in the register. He then presses a button on the register in slow motion, causing it to ring] [in slow motion] Uh-oh.
[Patrick drops SpongeBob and starts to have another tantrum, breaking the trophy, and kicking the tables and chairs. Mr. Krabs holds SpongeBob in front of him. Patrick bangs the register open and starts ripping the money to shreds.]
Mr. Krabs: No no no no no no no!
Herb: [he and Margie appear] Hello, son. We saw you fighting today.
Margie: On the TV. We're so proud.
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Mr. and Mrs. Star. I know you are loving parents, but you really messed up your kids by ringing a bell whenever it was time for his bath.
Margie: Bell? We never rang a bell.
Herb: Yeah, never.
Patrick: [stops having a tantrum] You never rang a bell?
Herb: No, don't you remember? We would squeeze your rubber duck.
Patrick: [gasps] My rubber duck.
Herb: Yes. [holds up the rubber duck] This one.
Patrick: [takes the rubber duck and holds it]
SpongeBob: Aw, kinda gets you right in your heart's kitchen, doesn't it, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I think I can tape it all back together. [close-up of a taped-up dollar bill]
Patrick: Ducky. I wonder if it still quacks. [squeezes the duck, and it quacks, triggering another tantrum, breaking stuff off-screen]

SpongeBob sees that Mr. Krabs is eating chum and likes it, but he does not understand why. Mr. Krabs tells a story about how during one of his navy days, he barely made it back to his ship alive only to find it robbed of all their supplies (although in actuality, he had slept through the entire day while his crew ate everything) and was forced to eat chum due to being the only food left, and upon eating it, grew to love it.SpongeBob promises to keep this a secret, and afterwards, the Slop Pail closes as the owner of the restaurant, Sal, wants to become a movie star. This leaves Mr. Krabs with no chum to eat that is not from the Chum Bucket.

However, Mr. Krabs says none of them are right.Mr. Krabs tries to prevent himself from going to the Chum Bucket, but ends up searching for chum there anyway. Karen and Plankton come outside as they heard a noise, and eventually find out about Mr. Krabs' secret.

However, he gets out and attacks Plankton, causing the formula to sink into the chum. Plankton decides to swim inside the chum to obtain the formula. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that he should eat all the chum so he can reach the formula first, and he does so. He gets the formula, but gets extremely overweight, loses his decades-long appetite for chum and accidentally eats Plankton.

[Squidward happily runs away from the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, I could still— [Mr. Krabs and everyone else is gone, leaving with only a nickel] A nickel? [licks the nickel] And it's the same temperature as Mr. Krabs. [picks up the nickel] Ooh, he's gonna want this back. [runs off]
[Mr. Krabs runs all over the streets of Bikini Bottom in a frantic panic. He hides behind the building and sees a taxi pulling over for a customer. He rolls over to the taxi and hides underneath it before it drives away. SpongeBob appears and fails to stop Mr. Krabs. He waves for another taxi.]
SpongeBob: Follow that boat! [crawls under the taxi before it drives away]
[The driver stops the taxi boat at a place that's located outside of Bikini Bottom, the Slop Pail. SpongeBob comes out from under the taxi and is completely beaten up.]
Taxi driver: Sorry about all those speed bumps, kid. And the cactus patch and the demolition derby.
SpongeBob: [dizzily] ""Roast moblem, Orfficer."" [pays the taxi driver and faints]
[Mr. Krabs is sitting at a picnic table, waiting impatiently for something. He checks his watch and frantically looks around. SpongeBob appears through the wood of the picnic table.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [shrieks as SpongeBob's appearance startles him] SpongeBob, what are you doing here, boy-o?
SpongeBob: [pulls himself out of the table] I brought your nickel, silly. [pauses and looks around] What is this place? And what are you doing here?
Mr. Krabs: Nothing, [takes the nickel] I've never been here before in my life.
[Just then, a man, who is the chef of the Slop Pail, appears and gives Mr. Krabs a bowl full of chum.]
Sal: Eugene, got your usual here: one big steaming plate of chum! Enjoy.
[The chum belches slime in SpongeBob's face.]
SpongeBob: ""Usual?"" ""Chum?"" ""Enjoy?"" Oh, I don't understand, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I suppose there's no hiding it, boy-o. It all started back in me old Navy days. [a flashback of Mr. Krabs' Navy days is shown] I was a young seaman on a dangerous mission deep in enemy territory.
[The flashback shows all of Mr. Krabs' Navy friends having a fun time at the beach. Mr. Krabs is sleeping in a hammock.]
Navy chef: [rings his triangle] Meal time.
[Mr. Krabs Navy friends run over the chef and climb onto the ship to eat their meals. Mr. Krabs continues to sleep in his hammock.]
Mr. Krabs: [voiceover] Somehow, in the madness of battle, I became separated from me crew. [his past self yawns and wakes up from his nap; he goes into the ship and sees everyone sleeping after eating too much] It took hours of fighting and sneaking and scraping to get back to me ship, but by the time I got there, our supplies have been decimated. [his past self sits in a chair and the chef feeds him chum] All we had left was chum...and I hadn't eaten since noon. [his past self starts to eat chum] I was starting to feel peckish. [his past self starts to take a liking to chum] But, oh, that flavor. Sweet and gamy with a cream, chunky mouthfeel. [a chum monkey appears as his past self continuously eats chum] Oh, I've had a chum monkey on my back ever since. [his chum monkey screeches before coming back to the present day] Been eating the stuff in secret for years now. [eats some of Sal's chum] Just got a taste for it. One of them survival things, I suppose. [a piece of Sal's chum gurgles for a bit before Mr. Krabs slurps it in his mouth] Oh, uh, look, SpongeBob, I don't want this getting out, you understand? [laughs] Especially to Plankton. So what do you say, huh? Keep me shame a secret, huh? For old Mr. Krabsy?
SpongeBob: [laughs] You got it, Mr. Krabs. My lips are sealed. [zips his mouth]
Mr. Krabs: Glad to hear it. Okay, see you tomorrow. [pushes SpongeBob away] Sal, I'm feeling hungry tonight. How's about another plate of chum?
Sal: Oh, sorry, Eugene, that was my last plate of chum, ever! I'm closing the Slop Pail permanently. [closes his restaurant]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] What?! [gulps]
Sal: Yep, I'm moving to Shell City to make it big in the pictures. Just imagine this mug on a movie screen 30 feet wide! [a closeup of his face is shown while laughing] See you in the movies! [drives away]
Mr. Krabs: But where will I get me chum from?
[Mr. Krabs is now stranded in the middle of nowhere alone. The scene changes back to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is pacing back and forth about where he'll get more chum.]
SpongeBob: Gosh, Mr. Krabs, I've never tried to make chum before. I don't even know what the ingredients are.
Mr. Krabs: Ugh, well, uh, it's, uh—it's made from... [whispers in SpongeBob's ear about what the actual ingredients of chum are and from what SpongeBob hears, it is really disgusting]
SpongeBob: [gags and groans in disgust] Eww. [as Mr. Krabs is done talking, SpongeBob turns pale and his yellow color melts off; he mops up his color and washes himself with it] Um, I don't think I can make that for you, Mr. Krabs, but I can make you some chum-free chum. You won't even be able to tell the difference.
Mr. Krabs: I sure hope you're right.
French narrator: Later…
[The scene changes to SpongeBob serving three kinds of chum for Mr. Krabs to enjoy.]
SpongeBob: Behold: three takes on chum à la SpongeBob. [Mr. Krabs gives a taste on the first plate of chum] The secret ingredient in this one? Krabby Patties. Well? Huh?
Mr. Krabs: It's delicious! [suddenly gets angry] Too delicious! [swats the first plate of chum away] Next!
SpongeBob: [gives Mr. Krabs another plate full of chum and Mr. Krabs gives another taste] To capture the natural bouquet of the chum, I made this batch entirely from old snail litter.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps, spits out some snail litter and his face shrivels] A little dry. [shakes his head back to normal] Next! [swats the second plate of chum away]
SpongeBob: [gives Mr. Krabs another plate full of chum] Ooh, I think you'll like this one. [Mr. Krabs gives it a taste] I know I do. [giggles] It's made from wishes and love.
[Mr. Krabs belches out hearts and sparkles. His face turns into SpongeBob's face and laughs like SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: [rubs his face back to normal] It's too sweet. Oh, none of these are right, SpongeBob. I think this old chum chewer needs some time alone. [leaves the Krusty Krab and sulks away]
[Later that night, Mr. Krabs stops at a brick wall and wails in sadness. His stomach moans and groans in hunger, giving Mr. Krabs so much pain.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, the Chum Bucket's the only place in town still selling chum, but I can't go crawling to Plankton for help. No, I won't. I got too much pride for that. [cuts to Mr. Krabs invading Plankton's trash can, looking for some chum] Oh, come on, there's gotta be some chum in here somewhere!
Karen: [comes out with a flashlight] Uh, hello? [Mr. Krabs hides behind the trash can] Who—who's out there?
Plankton: [comes out with a bat] All right, miscreant, come over here where I can destroy you! [swings the bat around, but gets crushed by it]
[Mr. Krabs attempts to escape, but Karen catches him.]
Karen and Plankton: Krabs?
Plankton: What are you doing here? [crawls out from under his bat]
Mr. Krabs: Nothing, nothing! I, uh, [takes the shoe out of his mouth] lost my shoe! See? Found it. [laughs] Okay, bye. [his stomach growls loudly]
Plankton: [suspiciously] Hold it. What's going on with you, Krabs? Your clothes are a mess and your stomach's making strange noises.
Mr. Krabs: [wears the shoe] What are you talking—I'm... [stammers until he gives in] Oh, fine! [throws away the shoe] I'm hooked on chum, okay?!
Plankton: Say what?! [his skeleton falls out in shock]
Mr. Krabs: Look at me now! Digging through garbage for scraps! [sobs uncontrollably]
Plankton: [sucks his skeleton back in his body] You actually like chum?
Karen: How is that possible? Nobody likes chum! It tastes terrible!
Plankton: [hops on Karen's screen] Shh! Mute your speaker, Karen. This pathetic display is giving me an idea. [walks over to a sobbing Mr. Krabs] All right, Krabs, old buddy, how would you like a lifetime supply of chum?
Mr. Krabs: [stops crying] Really?
Plankton: Sure, for the low, low price of the Krabby Patty secret formula!
Mr. Krabs: [shrieks] No, no, I can't! Not me formula.
Plankton: You sure, Krabs? [holds up a bowl full of chum] Just breathe in that noxious smell. [sniffs the chum and nearly gags; lassos Mr. Krabs down with the chum fumes and holds up a chum-shaped pendulum] You know you want it. [laughs evilly as he attempts to brainwash Mr. Krabs]
[The chum monkey in Mr. Krabs' head sees and hears everything. He climbs into Mr. Krabs' brain and reactivates it with a steering wheel. Mr. Krabs crawls over towards Plankton and attempts to eat some of his chum.]
Plankton: [throws the chum out of sight] Ah-ah-ah. Not until I have the formula.
Mr. Krabs: [growls] Oh, fine! I'll be right back. [goes to his restaurant, enters his office and opens his safe, only to find SpongeBob sleeping and cuddling with the secret formula inside]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing here, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, when I can't sleep, I come here to be close to the formula. It comforts me.
Mr. Krabs: Well, comfort time's over now! [grabs the formula] I'm trading the formula to Plankton for a lifetime supply of chum.
SpongeBob: [stops Mr. Krabs in his tracks] I can't let you do that, Mr. Krabs. [tries to pull the formula out of Mr. Krabs' claws] You'll thank me for this later. [grunts as he tugs and pulls] Okay. [gets dragged on the floor by an annoyed Mr. Krabs] Gotta get a better grip. [enters the Chum Bucket while being dragged to the floor; he sighs] Okay, okay.
Mr. Krabs: Plankton, where are you? I got the formula! I'm here to collect me chum!
Plankton: [off-screen] I'm up here, Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [climbs up the ladder and sees a whole lifetime supply of chum in an enormous barrel] Whoo-hoo! Just look at all that chum! And it's all for me! [laughs maniacally]
Plankton: Oh, I'm so sorry, Krabs. You foiled too many of my plans over the years for me not to double-cross you now. [holds up a remote] This time, I have the upper hand! [pushes the button and activates a giant robot fist, which crushes Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob; the secret formula rolls over to Plankton and he picks it up. To the camera] Get it? ""Upper hand?"" [laughs like crazy] I win and you get nothing!
[Mr. Krabs lifts the robot fist up and attacks Plankton. The two get into a massive brawl over the secret formula. But their fighting causes the secret formula to fall into the chum.]
SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton: [gasps] No!
[The secret formula sinks into the chum. Mr. Krabs gasps in shock as he eyestalks become secret formula bottles before disappearing into dust.]
Plankton: [puts on some swimwear] You and SpongeBrain can see yourselves out, Krabs. Ta-ta! [laughs] Alley-oop! [jumps onto the chum to get the secret formula]
Mr. Krabs: Oh no, this is terrible! Oh, my formula's gone! I'm ruined! And hungry! [cries]
SpongeBob: Wait, Mr. Krabs! Plankton is tiny. It'll take him forever to swim through that chum. [the chum bubbles] You can get to the formula before him, but you're gonna have to eat like the wind.
Mr. Krabs: You're right, boy-o! I can do this! [jumps into the barrel of chum]
SpongeBob: Whoo! [Mr. Krabs begins gobbling down on the lifetime supply of chum] Go, Mr. Krabs, go! Whoo! [Mr. Krabs eats some bread] No, don't fill up on bread! The chum ! Eat the chum!
Mr. Krabs: [takes out a straw] Right! [slurps on the rest of the chum until he is completely obese and full]
[SpongeBob climbs down, opens the barrel's door, and enters the chum barrel. Mr. Krabs groans and belches out the secret formula.]
SpongeBob: [hugs Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs, you did it! You saved the secret formula.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, and I think I killed me taste for chum too. See? [sticks out his tongue that has tombstones on his taste buds] I'll never touch another bite of this stuff as long as I live. [groans]
SpongeBob: Hey, where'd Plankton go?
Karen: [takes out an X-ray] Hold still. [pulls the X-ray down to reveal Plankton inside Mr. Krabs' stomach] This isn't the first time this has happened. [the X-ray shows Plankton struggling inside Mr. Krabs' stomach] Hmm, could take him a while to get out.
SpongeBob: What should we do while we wait?
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, Karen, Mr. Krabs, and the chum monkey watching Sal's latest movie at the movie theater. He is the star of an action-adventure movie that features an evil mad scientist and a secret agent.]
Sal: You'll never get away with this, Dr. Kelpington!
SpongeBob: [whispers to the chum monkey] Mm, could you pass the popcorn?
[The chum monkey screeches at SpongeBob.]
Plankton: [still inside Mr. Krabs' stomach] Get me out of here!

The Gal Pals - Karen, Sandy, and Mrs. Puff - are preparing for a camping trip. They load their trailer and afterwards attach it to the boat. Pearl, the newest member, plans to prank them by having SpongeBob scare them. When Pearl arrives, Sandy puts her backpack, which has SpongeBob in it, in the trailer. The Gal Pals start driving and sing a song. They run over a pothole and the trailer disconnects from the boat, crashing in a pit of mud. SpongeBob is able to get out before the trailer sinks, and he finds a lucky peanut.At the cabin, Sandy notices that the trailer has disconnected. Pearl is sad about losing her backpack, but Karen says that they can buy a new one. The Gal Pals quickly redecorate the abandoned cabin, and Pearl leaves to call SpongeBob. She advises him to ""follow the trees"" to find the cabin, and he runs into the woods. At night, the Gal Pals are sitting around a campfire. Sandy gives Pearl a necklace, and she, Karen, and Mrs. Puff tell her a scary story about the former fourth Gal Pal to whom the necklace belongs, Flibberty Gibbet, who is still roaming around in the woods for revenge after an argument. Pearl is scared and throws away the necklace, and the other Gal Pals start laughing at her, having successfully pranked her. Pearl laughs as a hand grabs the necklace from the floor.After a noise, Mrs. Puff and Sandy explain that the story of Flibberty Gibbet was actually true. Pearl thinks the noise is SpongeBob, who is still lost. Karen plans for all four of them to jump out and scare SpongeBob. A monster then appears, and they run into the cabin and plan to escape.SpongeBob appears at the cabin and is grabbed by the monster. The Gal Pals run in to save him, only to find that the monster is actually a saleslady selling pinecones on sticks. Flibberty Gibbet appears, not intending any harm to the Gal Pals, and they get scared and run away. SpongeBob chases after them with his lucky peanut. The episode ends with a fourth wall break as the four girls crash into the screen. They slide down, and then a ""The End"" sign shows up.",A Cabin in the Kelp,"[The episode begins at Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff are getting ready for a camping trip in the kelp forest.]
Mrs. Puff: [laughs while reading a camping brochure] We are going to have so much fun! A weekend in a cabin in the woods with the Gal Pals!
Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff: Gal Pals! Yeah!
[Mrs. Puff takes out a Krabby Patty and goes to eat it.]
Karen: [takes the Krabby Patty from Mrs. Puff] Oh a Krabby Patty! [squeezes its juice in the boatmobile's engine] Perfect.
Mrs. Puff: [grossed out] Ugh.
Karen: The engine needed greasing. [closes the boatmobile's hood]
Sandy: [lassos the trailer towards her] Congratulations, Mrs. Puff! [hooks the trailer on the boatmobile] Your boat and trailer just got hitched! [puts a bride tiara and groom hot on both the boatmobile and trailer, throws some confetti and shares a good laugh with Karen and Mrs. Puff]
Mrs. Puff: [checks her watch] Hmm, I wonder what's keeping our newest Gal Pal?
[Meanwhile, the newest member of the Gal Pals, Pearl Krabs, is skipping down the road with her backpack.]
Pearl: This is gonna be so funny. The Gal Pals will obviously try to prank the newbie, but this newbie is gonna prank them right back. [laughs]
SpongeBob: [pops out of Pearl's backpack] Boo! Who likes eggs? [laughs]
Pearl: Not now, SpongeBob. [stuffs SpongeBob back in her backpack] Wait until you're around the campfire. And you're supposed to act scary, not lame.
SpongeBob: Oh scary. Got it! Wait until the fire then make with the scary. [makes goofy faces and weird noises]
Pearl: [pushes SpongeBob in her backpack] Keep working on it. [meets up with Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff]
Sandy: Here comes our newest member!
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: Gal Pals! Yeah!
[The four girls share a good laugh.]
Sandy: Here, let me get your bag. [takes Pearl's backpack and throws it in the trailer]
[The girls stuff the trailer with many camping supplies: tents, sleeping bags, sporting equipment, lanterns, pillows, extra blankets, umbrellas, food, a grill, swimwear, and suitcases with extra clothing. SpongeBob peaks his eyes out through all those camping supplies just as the trailer door closed.]
SpongeBob: Nice and cozy.
[The girls climb in the boatmobile and begin driving away to the kelp forest.]
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: ♪We're Gal Pals and, yes, we shall conquer the world one day! We're no sea bunnies, we're smart and funny and we demand equal pay! We'll shout ""Gal Pals"" right into your ear canal and bang it on a drum! We're sweet and nice, but take our advice cross us and you'll be chum!♪
[The girls' singing comes to an abrupt halt when they see a moose snail in the middle of the road. They let the moose snail cross and drive away while sharing another good laugh.]
Mrs. Puff: Ooh, this is gonna be so much fun! We're gonna have a real adventure with our newbie, aren't we, ladies?
[Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff snicker quietly together. Pearl makes a nervous laugh and share another good laugh with the others. Pearl quietly snickers to herself for the prank she planned on her own. Suddenly, the trailer hits a bump and gets unhooked by the boatmobile. The trailer skidded off the road and rolls down into a ditch filled with mud. SpongeBob, feeling sick, climbs out of the trailer, slips on the mud, and gets a bit messy. He wrings the mud off him.]
SpongeBob: Where am I? [climbs out of the mud pit and finds himself in the kelp forest] Huh? All right, I'll just sit tight and wait to hear from Pearl. I've got the trailer, so there's plenty of food and blankets. [the trailer full of camping supplies sink in the mud; he growls and kicks a pebble] Barnacles! Now what am I gonna do? [sticks his hands in his pockets and finds a peanut] Hey, a peanut! A lucky peanut! Mm, I'm not gonna go hungry out here. I'm gonna survive! [his voice echoes] Wait a minute, I can't eat this peanut. You're my lucky peanut. [giggles] I've got a lucky peanut! [his voice echoes again]
[Meanwhile, the girls made it to the cabin they rented for their camping trip.]
Mrs. Puff: Here we are.
Sandy: [notices the trailer is gone] Uh-oh, looks like we lost something.
Pearl: [gasps] Oh no, my backpack! This is the worst thing that could ever happen! [cries a river of tears]
Karen: [comforts Pearl] Aww, there, there, sweetie. It's just a backpack. We can buy you a new one. It's not like losing a friend.
Pearl: [stops crying with mascara runs down her face and whimpers; to the audience.] She must be psychic. [resumes crying]
Sandy: Aww, heck, we'll just have to rough it! [opens the door and sees the cabin a complete mess; there are bones, algae, toadstools, cobwebs, a wolfworm who steals a bone and runs off, and the floor and ceiling are decaying] All right, gals, let's not just hang here like mama's washing! Time to gussy up the place!
[The scene changes to the cabin looking good as new. It now has a radio with stereo equipment, new wallpaper, a lamp, some beanbag chairs, a sofa, a dining table with chairs, a chandelier, some new windows, and a refrigerator filled with many kinds of food.]
Karen: Good thing we have a Texas tornado among the Gal Pals. Who knew you could use a jellyfish as a recharger. [grabs a jellyfish and recharges herself with its stingers] Oh, yeah. [sighs and faints]
Sandy: Yep, nature always provides.
Mrs. Puff: [sets a cornucopia with food in it on the table] Hey, where's the newbie?
[Pearl is outside the cabin trying to contact with SpongeBob on her cellphone.]
Pearl: Oh...Oh, please, SpongeBob, be all right. [dials the number on her cellphone]
[Meanwhile, SpongeBob is exploring the kelp forest by swinging on vines like a jungle man.]
SpongeBob: [making goofy jungle noises while swinging] I'm Sponge-zan of the brine apes! [swings on several vines, crashes into a tree, and falls in a bush; then he hears ringing sounds and takes out the peanut] Oh, my lucky peanut's ringing. [pulls a human ear out of his head] Hello? [hears ringing in his other pocket, takes out a shellphone and answers it] Shell-lo? [laughs]
Pearl: SpongeBob! Oh, thank Neptune, you're still alive.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Pearl, I'm still gonna do the prank. I just have to find your cabin. Are there any landmarks I can head to?
Pearl: Uh, well, there are a lot of trees.
SpongeBob: Trees, perfect! I'll just follow the trees. [hangs up the shellphone] Are you sure you didn't ring, too, lucky peanut? Hello, hello? Ugh, bad reception. No peanut bars. [the peanut shows connection bars on it; he puts it in his pocket and goes to follow the trees] Follow the trees! Follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees...
[As time passes, day turns to nighttime. The girls are sitting together around the campfire drinking kelp cocoa.]
Mrs. Puff: [slurps some kelp cocoa] Oh, this kelp cocoa is delicious.
Karen: [scans her kelp cocoa] Yeah, my sensors indicate an agreeable flavor. [dumps her kelp cocoa on the ground]
Sandy: [grabs a flashlight] Okay, Gal Pals, [turns it on and leans it to her helmet] it's time to initiate our newest member. [turns it off and puts a Gal Pal necklace on Pearl]
Mrs. Puff: You are now a Gal Pal.
Pearl: That's it? Just this necklace? No swats or parading around in my PJ's? No tryin' to scare me with urban legends?
Sandy: Why would we do that?
Karen: Yeah, we like you.
Mrs. Puff: We haven't had a forth member since that incident with Flibberty Gibbet. I— [gets her mouth shut by Sandy]
Sandy: Puff! Shh.
Pearl: Who's ""Slippery Giveth""?
Sandy: Oh Flibberty Gibbet. She was the fourth member of our group. We had a fight with her years ago right here at this very cabin one dark and stormy night. [thunder crashes in her eyes]
Mrs. Puff: We don't even remember what the fight was about.
[While Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff explain, their shadows tell every detail of the argument they had with Flibberty Gibbet.]
Sandy: It sure was a humdinger of an argument!
Karen: She went bananas and vowed to destroy any and all the Gal Pals. [the green line on her screen turns red]
Mrs. Puff: Then she just ran off into these woods!
Sandy: Some say she's still out there, all hot-headed and waiting to get her revenge. [hides in her suit]
Karen: That's her pendant you're wearing.
Pearl: [looks at the pendant and sees Flibberty Gibbet's name on it] ""Flibberty Gibbet""?! [screams in fear, takes off the necklace and throws it away] Why did you give me that? Why did you take me here?! [Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff laugh; Pearl blushes and laughs as well] Thanks gals, you got me. But I knew you were gonna prank me.
Karen: Sure you did.
Mrs. Puff: You should have seen your face.
Sandy: We got you good!
[While the girls are talking, a creepy hand comes out and takes the pendant.]
Pearl: [laughs] Mm, Gal Pals.
[All of a sudden, the girls hear scary sounds from within the trees. Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff huddle together in fear.]
Sandy: [gasps] What was that?
Pearl: 'Kay, you can stop trying to scare me. I know Flipperty Giblets is a prank.
Karen: Flibberty Gibbet is partly true.
Mrs. Puff: She was a Gal Pal. We did have a fight with her.
Sandy: And she did run off into these woods.
Pearl: Wait, that was all the parts!
[The scary sounds are getting louder. Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff quiver in fright.]
Mrs. Puff: Quick, let's hide in the cabin!
Pearl: Wait, it—it's okay. It's only SpongeBob. I asked him to make noise and prank you. All right SpongeBob, you can come out! I'm canceling the prank!
[The bubbles transition to SpongeBob still following the trees. But it turns out that he's only walking back and forth from one tree to the other.]
SpongeBob: [laughs quietly and touches a tree] There's another tree. [skids to the tree next to it] And another tree. Wow, following the trees really works. [touches the trees between him] Tree, tree, tree, tree.
[Back at the cabin, the girls are still sitting by the campfire.]
Mrs. Puff: So SpongeBob thinks he can prank us, huh? We'll prank him right back. [begins to go insane] We can rig up the cabin with trap doors, flying ghosts, and a thousand cadavers in a zombie ballroom! [covers her mouth after realizing she's losing her composure] Ooh, what am I saying?
Sandy: Let's scale it down a smidge.
Karen: Yeah, let's hide behind this tree and scream when he shows up.
[The girls hide behind a nearby tree and giggle.]
Sandy: You coming, Pearl?
Pearl: Well I'm certainly not staying by myself in the dark. [joins the girls in hiding behind the tree to prank SpongeBob]
Sandy: Shh, he's coming. Wait for it. Now!
[The girls jump out and make a loud, scary scream. However, it turns out that it was just a scary old lady, not SpongeBob. The old lady roars angrily.]
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: Flibberty Gibbet! [scream as they run into the cabin and try to hold the door shut]
Mrs. Puff: It's her! Oh s—she looks like she's been in the woods too long!
Sandy: I have a plan. We'll run out the back door and into Puff's boat. Count of three. One, two, three!
[The girls run from the door and scream. The old lady breaks through the front door and roars. The girls run out the back door and jump into the boatmobile.]
Karen: Let's go!
[Just then, SpongeBob jumps out and makes scary noises.]
SpongeBob: Rawr! Hmm? [shrugs and skips to the cabin's front door]
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: No, no! SpongeBob, don't go in!
SpongeBob: [sees the girls] Oh, hello.
[The old lady grabs SpongeBob and drags him in the cabin. SpongeBob's screaming is heard from the inside. The girls scream in horror.]
Sandy: Gal Pals, we have to save SpongeBob!
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: [whimpering] Gal Pals.
[The girls break through the front door to rescue SpongeBob. But, to their relief and surprise, the old lady turns out to be a sales lady giving SpongeBob pinecones on a stick.]
SpongeBob: Wow! [the old lady gives SpongeBob a pinecone on a stick] Ooh, another pinecone on a stick! I love it. [takes it and gets another one from the old lady] Wow! [takes another pinecone on a stick] I'm gonna get one of these for each of the Gal Pals.
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: [confused] Huh?
Sandy: [laughs in relief] It's only a cabin-to-cabin country sales lady. Not Flibberty Gibbet at all.
Flibberty Gibbet: [off-screen] Did someone say my name? [the girls turn and see her for real this time] Hi, gals!
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: Flibberty Gibbet! [scream as they run out of the cabin and into the woods]
Flibberty Gibbet: I—I just wanted to say all's forgiven!
SpongeBob: [follows the girls] Hey wait, you'll need my lucky peanut!
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: Gal Pals! [crash onto the screen.]

SpongeBob attempts to read while driving, but does not notice that they are about to crash into a brick wall. SpongeBob takes a sharp turn to avoid the brick wall, but starts driving towards Mrs. Puff's lighthouse. SpongeBob is able to brake in time to avoid crashing into the lighthouse, but a wave of junk from inside the lighthouse ends up spilling onto them anyway. SpongeBob pulls Mrs. Puff out of the rubble, and tries to make up for the damage he caused, but nothing pleases her. Mrs. Puff exclaims that SpongeBob should clean up her lighthouse, since she has been tossing old junk in there for 20 years. She leaves SpongeBob to the task, and heads back into her classroom to listen to heavy metal music. SpongeBob heads into the lighthouse, and cleans it fairly quickly by eating all of the assorted objects and spitting them back out into boxes. He then notices that the lighthouse is extremely dusty, so he cleans the place up using a mop. As SpongeBob is about to head into the next room to shine the lighthouse's lantern, he hears moaning on the other side of the door.He assumes the lighthouse is haunted, just like his toaster. After a cutaway reveals SpongeBob's toaster really is haunted, SpongeBob slowly opens the door. Suddenly, a box drops from the ceiling, scaring SpongeBob into stumbling down the stairs, and onto a box, causing all the trash that SpongeBob just cleaned up to flood everywhere. SpongeBob is terrified as the box slowly approaches him, only to be relieved when it is revealed that a stray snail was inside. SpongeBob decides to name the snail ""Louie"" as he gets back to work cleaning. However, when SpongeBob tries to continue cleaning, he trips over Louie, prompting SpongeBob to leave Louie outside so he does not get in the way. Although when SpongeBob goes back inside, Louie is also somehow back inside, so SpongeBob decides to tie Louie to a nearby boat so he will be out of his hair. Once again though, Louie is somehow back inside the lighthouse, so SpongeBob attempts to throw him out, only to be thrown out himself. SpongeBob refuses to be outsmarted by a snail, and in the next scene, we see SpongeBob trying to trap Louie in a box by using a can of Krabby Patties as bait. However, SpongeBob is outsmarted yet again, as Louie traps him inside of a box. When SpongeBob is unable to lift up the box himself, he eats some Krabby Patty grease (in a reference to Popeye the Sailor Man) to grow buff and lift the box off of him. Soon after, SpongeBob finds Louie in the room with the lighthouse's lantern, but Louie suddenly becomes feral and attacks SpongeBob, biting him all over his face. In the scuffle, SpongeBob accidentally turns on the lighthouse's light switch, shining a very bright light into Bikini Bottom. Bubble Bass, Larry the Lobster, and a third fish notice the light, as SpongeBob and Louie's shadows are being cast onto it. Larry thinks that they are a couple of buff dudes, while Bubble Bass thinks they are giant monsters, causing the trio to panic.The ruckus eventually causes the lighthouse to tip over and start rolling around Bikini Bottom (unbeknownst to Mrs. Puff, who is still listening to her heavy metal music). Larry and the other fish run away, but Bubble Bass ends up getting flattened by the lighthouse. Afterwards, Perch Perkins is seen interviewing Fred on the news, as Fred frantically explains that a lighthouse caused all the destruction. Perch Perkins asks Fred if the lighthouse injured ""HIS LEGS,"" to which Fred sadly replies no. Mr. Krabs sees this on the news, and tells all of his customers to protect the Krusty Krab. They all run away however, and SpongeBob, not wanting to destroy the Krusty Krab, turns the lighthouse around with his feet. Although, when Louie attacks him again, the lighthouse turns back around and ends up destroying the Krusty Krab anyway, injuring Mr. Krabs in the process. The lighthouse ends up rolling back to Mrs. Puff's boating school and is thrown back into its original position. After the chaos, SpongeBob frantically wonders where Louie is, only to find out that Louie was actually a mother taking care of her babies. SpongeBob comments on how he should start calling her ""Louise"" instead. In the next scene, SpongeBob shows Mrs. Puff the clean lighthouse, to which Mrs. Puff exclaims how proud she is of SpongeBob, giving him a gold star. SpongeBob then shows Mrs. Puff ""Louise"" and her babies, telling her how they were hiding inside the lighthouse. Mrs. Puff finds the snails adorable. SpongeBob leaves boating school for the day, as Mrs. Puff is relieved that SpongeBob did not create a huge disaster. Just then, she is confronted by several Bikini Bottomites, including Mr. Krabs, Bubble Bass, and Larry the Lobster. They are furious that Mrs. Puff's lighthouse has caused so much damage in town, and demand to know what she is going to do about it. In response, Mrs. Puff puts on her headphones and (along with Louise and her babies) start jamming out to her heavy metal music, as the episode ends.",Lighthouse Louie,"[The episode starts the boating school, with SpongeBob doing a boating test.]
Mrs. Puff: [she reads off her clipboard] Now, SpongeBob, what is the proper procedure for making a right turn?
SpongeBob: [thinks] Hold on, I'll check the textbook. [gets the textbook] Ah, ""Your Mirror and You."" Hmm, proper seat belt hygiene? No. [he continues to look at the textbook as Mrs. Puff puts on a helmet]
Mrs. Puff: Assuming crash position.
[Mrs. Puff screams as the boat is about to hit a wall. SpongeBob turns the boat quick enough so it doesn't crash. The boat is still out of control, and the two continue screaming. He puts his tongue on the breaks and stops the boat before it hits the lighthouse.]
Mrs. Puff: [relieved] We didn't crash!
SpongeBob: [happy] Hooray!
[The boat inches slightly forward and hits the platform of the lighthouse, knocking it over. The two scream as everything in it falls out. SpongeBob comes out of the rubble but Mrs. Puff doesn't.]
SpongeBob: [worried and calls out] Mrs. Puff! Oh, there you are. [pulls Mrs. Puff out of the rubble but she ends up on him. He gets out from under her] I'll make it up to you, Mrs. Puff. I'll shine your shoes! [takes out his tongue and starts shining them with it] Dry your hair! [combs her hair and then becomes a hairdryer to dry her hairs, only for them to get crumpled. She gets angry] Oil your boat? [has a very worried expression as he's putting the oil. Some of it gets onto Mrs. Puff, to her dismay.]
Mrs. Puff: [as she's blocking out the oil] SpongeBob! Stop! Cease! Desist! [pants heavily and gets the oil off herself] Well, you could clean up all this junk. I've been tossing stuff in this old lighthouse for 20 years!
SpongeBob: [gets excited and hugs Mrs. Puff] I love cleaning!
Mrs. Puff: [pushes SpongeBob a little bit away from her] Uh-huh, glad to hear it. I'll be in my classroom. [goes into the boating school. She comes outside again to tell SpongeBob something] Oh, and if you need me... [her smile turns into a frown] ...don't. [shuts the door]
[Mrs. Puff is about to meditate and turns on the music. Quickly afterwards, the meditation music becomes rock music and Mrs. Puff starts rocking. Scene changes to SpongeBob in a bathing suit, diving into the pile of stuff. He makes his way through until he finally reaches the lighthouse. He makes a couple of dolphin noises after coming out and then takes out the stuff that got in his body. He takes off his bathing hat then chews it like gum and blows it so he can make several boxes out of it. He happily goes back to cleaning and eats the remainder of the stuff. After filling himself with stuff, he shoots everything into several boxes and then puts those boxes inside a small box.]
SpongeBob: [sighs in relief] That takes care of that. [leans to the side of the stairs, only to slip due to them being covered with dust. He rubs his finger on the dust, and it coughs on him] Yuck. This place needs a good scrub.
[Scene changes to SpongeBob with some cleaning supplies. He pours the water in the bucket on himself and absorbs it. He then puts his head on the floor and starts cleaning it. After cleaning the floor, he cleans the stairs in a short amount of time. He is now at the top of the stairs.]
SpongeBob: Ah, almost done. I just need to shine out that old lighthouse's lantern. [He hears some weird sounds, and gets terrified by them] The lighthouse is haunted! Just like my toaster.
[A toaster is seen swinging around SpongeBob's kitchen while making scary noises. The toast comes out of the toaster, in the shape of a ghost.]
SpongeBob: [opens the door, only for there to be nothing inside. After making a sigh of relief, a box falls down and starts moving, scaring him] That box is haunted! [He falls down the stairs and gets hurt several times as he's going down] These stairs are haunted! [SpongeBob lands on the small box, causing all the big boxes as well as all the stuff packed in them to spill all over the lighthouse again] This trash is haunted. [the box creeps towards him, and he panics while backing away]
Louie: [comes out of the box] Meow.
SpongeBob: [still scared] Ahh! Ghost snail! [he cowers and cries a little]
Louie: [goes next to SpongeBob and soothes him] Meow.
SpongeBob: [becomes happy] Oh, you're no ghost. Just a cute little stray snail. How about I call you Louie? Lighthouse Louie! [giggles]
Louie: [accepting his name to be Louie] Meow, meow!
SpongeBob: [as he's putting down Louie] Now, Louie, you'll be good while uncle SpongeBob cleans. [attempts to pick up a box]
Louie: [goes to SpongeBob] Meow, meow. [SpongeBob trips on him. After he lands on the floor, he goes over him, while covering him with slime] Meow.
SpongeBob: [gets up and takes Louie outside the lighthouse] Louie, I'm afraid you'll have to play out here, little fella. For your own safety. [goes back inside and shuts the door, while sighing in relief. Several objects get thrown from inside the box, the thrower being Louie] What! Louie? [scene changes to him tying Louie onto the boat so he won't bother him] Well, that oughta keep you out of my hair!
Louie: [seen in the lighthouse, having already escaped] Meow, meow!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Louie, you have to stay outside. [attempts to throw Louie outside, but ends up getting thrown outside himself, with the part of the car Louie was tied to being thrown onto him as well] No silly little snail is a match for my superior sponge brain! [shows his brain, doing a small dance until the wind ends up knocking it down from its position] [scene changes to him bringing out a Krabby Patty in a Can, while giggling. He opens the can with his teeth and puts it on a plate] And the bait: one can-o-patty. [SpongeBob ties a rope onto a stick holding a box above the can-o-patty, and hides behind the stuff.]
Louie: [notices the Krabby Patty] Meow! [goes under the box and licks it several times]
SpongeBob: [pulls the string] Gotcha! [the box goes down and traps Louie. He opens the box, but the snail is gone] I don't gotcha. [realizes Louie put a bigger box on top of the small box. The snail pulls the string for the larger box, causing him to get trapped] You got me. [pulls up his nose to turn on his light, and tries to get out of the box, only to break his arms] Barnacles, that's heavy. Huh? [sees the Krabby Patty in a Can is still inside and uses his feet to grab it. He eats the small portion of it that was left, allowing him to become extremely strong, enough to get outside the box with ease. He realizes Louie isn't there] Huh, where'd Louie go? [his arms let out air and become weak again. He is now at the top of the lighthouse, calling out for Louie] Louie! Louie! Louie!
Louie: [on top of lantern] Meow.
SpongeBob: [relieved to finally see Louie] Louie! So this is where you've been hiding? [Louie shrieks at him, making him gulp and become scared] Nice snail, good Louie! [backs up] No, no... [screams]
[Louie jumps on him, and they go all over the top of the lighthouse. They hit the wall, and when they come off, SpongeBob accidentally flicks the button to turn on the lighthouse's lantern. It shines on a place called Protein Fiend, where it reflects SpongeBob and Louie fighting on one of its walls.]
Larry: [amazed by the reflection] Whoa, those dudes are huge! I wonder what they lift. [hits Bubble Bass slightly with his elbow]
Bubble Bass: [notices the reflection and drops his drink in fear] Those aren't dudes. They're giant monsters! [screaming] Everybody panic! [the three start panicking and run around in circles]
[Louie is biting SpongeBob, and their ruckus causes the lighthouse to start rocking. At the same time, Mrs. Puff is still listening and rocking to the rock music, unaware of what's going on outside. The lighthouse tips over and rolls out of the boating school. Larry, Bubble Bass, and the small fish are still panicking until they see that the reflection is gone.]
Larry: [happy] Those buff monsters have vanished! [hugs the other two] We're saved! [he and the other two hear some noise, and realize the lighthouse is coming their way]
Bubble Bass: We're doomed! [he gets out his drink and starts walking across the sidewalk away from the lighthouse, while the other two runoff in a different direction. The lighthouse runs over him, causing him to get submerged into the sidewalk with his posterior sticking out] My cheeks!
[Bikini Bottom News plays, showing Perch Perkins having an interview with Fred about the lighthouse.]
Perch Perkins: Can you please tell our viewers the cause of this destruction?
Fred: [frightened] It was a lighthouse. It rolled through town, destroying everything in its path! [pants] A lighthouse! [goes on his knees and starts crying]
Perchy Perkins: [shocked] My goodness. Were you or your legs injured by this insane lighthouse?
Fred: [sad and kicks a rock] No.
[The lighthouse is now rolling towards the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [shrieks as he watches the lighthouse on TV rolling towards his restaurant] That blasted lighthouse is gonna demolish me Krusty Krab! [speaks to his customers] Attention loyal customers!
Paco: Run for our lives?
Mr. Krabs: No, throw your bodies in front of that lighthouse, and protect me restaurant! [some rumbling occurs]
[All the customers run out of the Krusty Krab, while Louie is still attempting to bite SpongeBob as they're on the lighthouse.]
SpongeBob: [realizes they're heading for the Krusty Krab] No, not the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of the restaurant, brave] Stay away from me restaurant, you dirty... er... lighthouse! [the lighthouse continues rolling his way. He hides in his shell, now scared]
SpongeBob: [having trouble speaking] Must... stop... lighthouse. [jumps and turns around, causing his shoes to burn when he lands and the lighthouse to stop before it crashes into the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of his shell] Ha-ha, and don't come back! [laughs some more as the lighthouse is moving away]
[Louie smashes onto SpongeBob, causing the lighthouse to turn back around and crash into the Krusty Krab as Mr. Krabs is going inside it.]
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of the rubble, severely damaged] Oh, you came back. [his arms and eyes fall out of his body]
[The lighthouse rolls towards the boating school and hits a rock causing it to fly into the air. It lands on a boat, which drives onto the original placement of the lighthouse before the boat gets destroyed by it. At the same time, Mrs. Puff continues to listen to her rock music, still unaware of what's going on in her surroundings. All the boxes of stuff land on the floor in towers, all organized. Meanwhile, a scared SpongeBob is on the lighthouse's lantern, and gets off of it to search for Louie.]
SpongeBob: [worried] Louie? Where's Louie? [he hears some meowing, and when he opens the lantern's door, he realizes Louie gave birth to several baby snails] Aw, Louie, you weren't trying to stop me from cleaning! [pats one of the baby snails] You were just protecting your cute little babies. [the baby snails meow in unison] I guess I should call you Louise instead! [laughs]
[SpongeBob brings Mrs. Puff inside the lighthouse.]
Mrs. Puff: [shocked and amazed] You actually did a good job, SpongeBob! You deserve a gold star! [puts a star on his forehead]
SpongeBob: [excited] Ohh, a gold star! I have a present for you, too, Mrs. Puff. [gives her a box with Louie and her baby snails] These little cuties were hiding in your lighthouse.
Mrs. Puff: [in awe, chuckles] Aren't you adorable?
SpongeBob: [blushes] Oh, Mrs. Puff, you're pretty cute, too!
[Mrs. Puff frowns at this statement. The two go outside the lighthouse towards the entrance at the school, where SpongeBob leaves the school.]
SpongeBob: [happy] See you next week, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: [relieved] Amazing. For once, SpongeBob didn't create a huge disaster! [hears the angry mob]
Mr. Krabs: [angry along with the others in the mob] Puff! Your blasted lighthouse destroyed the whole town! [becomes sad] And me restaurant!
Mrs. Puff: [shocked] My lighthouse?!
The entire mob: What are you going to do about it?!
Mrs. Puff: [puts on her headphones, turns on her radio, and starts rocking again] Talk to the fin! [The snails come out of the box, and rock with her as well.]",0.68,Luke Brookshier

He tells SpongeBob to lock the windows, always keep a weapon on his person and to not step foot into his bedroom. Mr. Krabs hands SpongeBob a baseball bat, but SpongeBob accidentally hits himself with it, making Mr. Krabs throw the bat away. Mr. Krabs further explains that Pearl is staying with friends, and that SpongeBob will be all alone. He then warns that the neighborhood has seen a spike in robberies recently, and orders SpongeBob to not answer the door for anyone. As Mr. Krabs leaves, he tests this by knocking on his own door as SpongeBob answers, but SpongeBob realizes his mistake and slams the door in Mr. Krabs' face, much to Krabs' satisfaction. In the next scene, SpongeBob is seen checking around the house, making sure there are no robbers about. He then notices Mr. Krabs' bedroom, and suspects that burglars might be hiding, but remembers that he is not allowed to set foot in there. To get around this, SpongeBob ties a balloon to his nose. While searching through Mr. Krabs' bedroom, SpongeBob finds money under his pillow, a music box with a Mrs. Puff figurine, a bottle of cologne called ""Midnight Pincer,"" and a knot collection. SpongeBob suddenly hears a doorbell, and assumes it's the pizza that he ordered earlier. SpongeBob tells the delivery boy to slide the pizza into the mail slot, since he isn't allowed to open the door.Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs arrives at the Bikini Bottom Convention Hall for the Fast Food Founding Fathers (or F.F.F.F.) convention. The doorman asks Mr. Krabs to pay 10 cents as an entrance fee, but Mr. Krabs thinks 10 cents is a ripoff and decides to go home. As Mr. Krabs is taking off, he overhears another fish winning 1,000 dollars for being the 100th person to enter the building, much to his shock. Back at Mr. Krabs' house, SpongeBob is seen watching TV, but when a horror movie comes on, he turns off the TV in fright. Just then, a knock is heard at the door, and SpongeBob approaches cautiously. It is Mr. Krabs, who cannot enter his house because he forgot his keys. SpongeBob does not believe him, however, as he thinks that Mr. Krabs is still at his convention. SpongeBob admits that the ""robber"" sounds like Mr. Krabs, but looks nothing like him (due to the door's peephole distorting Mr. Krabs' appearance thus making him look different). Mr. Krabs attempts to get in through the mail slot, but fails due to him being too big. He then notices that the top window is open, and starts climbing on the side of his house in order to reach it. In a frenzy, SpongeBob calls Patrick on the phone and asks him to come over to Krabs' house, due to thinking the ""burglar"" is trying to break in. Patrick arrives shortly, and is able to enter the house via the mail slot, due to him having no bones and being completely made out of blubber. At the same time, Mr. Krabs is able to approach his window, but is struck down by lightning. SpongeBob and Patrick decide to start setting up traps for the robber.In the next scene, Mr. Krabs' house is filled with booby traps, such as pillows being hung from the ceiling, and a bucket of warm water being set under the window. They hear glass breaking, and prepare all the traps for use. Mr. Krabs tries to break in through the window, but is sprayed in the eyes by his own perfume, and lands in a puddle of mud. Afterwards, Mr. Krabs tries to enter his house via the toilet (while still covered in mud), but SpongeBob is able to intercept him and flush him back down the toilet using a plunger. Once again, Mr. Krabs tries breaking in, this time through his pet door, but is nearly sliced up by ""sharp"" cheddar. SpongeBob and Patrick celebrate their victory over the robber by watching a tough guy action movie on TV. At the same time, though, Mr. Krabs has had enough and decides to use a giant wrecking ball to break into his own house, and SpongeBob and Patrick are unaware of this due to the sound effects in the movie. Mr. Krabs finally manages to break in, but is trapped inside of a laundry basket held down by a cinderblock. At this point, Mr. Krabs gives up and starts crying, handing SpongeBob and Patrick his ID card to prove he's the real Mr. Krabs. Realizing their mistake, SpongeBob and Patrick release Mr. Krabs from the trap and apologize for attacking him the whole night. However, Mr. Krabs isn't mad at them, due to SpongeBob actually following his orders. After the trio exchange a hug, they hear more knocking at the door. It's Pearl, who also forgot her keys, but Mr. Krabs doesn't believe her (due to, once again, the door's peephole distorting Pearl's appearance). SpongeBob and Patrick are prepared to set up more traps, and Pearl is seen still banging on the front door, as the episode ends.","Knock Knock, Who's There?","[The episode begins at Mr. Krabs' house.]
Mr. Krabs: Now remember, boy-o, I'm trusting you to take care of me house when I'm away. House-sitting is a very important responsibility! Check the windows, [shuts the windows] and make sure the security system is always on your person. [takes out a bat]
SpongeBob: Ooh! [SpongeBob picks up Mr. Krabs' bat, shakes a little bit, and then swings it around, beating himself up.]
Mr. Krabs: [takes his bat back and throws it away] Scrap that last order. And [grabs SpongeBob] do not step foot into me bedroom! [lets go of SpongeBob] I've got me private things in there. [giggles] Ahem. Now Pearl is staying with friends, so you'll be here all alone.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. Your house is in good hands with me. [notices he doesn't have hands and then sneezes which brings his hands back] See? [wiggles fingers and laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Now there's been a rash of robberies in the neighborhood, so do not [pokes SpongeBob's face three times] open the door... [leans close on SpongeBob] ...for anyone!
[Mr. Krabs leaves his house, then, SpongeBob closes the door, and sighs in relief. Then, as SpongeBob starts to walk off, he hears someone knocking at the door, and SpongeBob goes to the door again, and opens it revealing to be Mr. Krabs, who's knocking on the door.]
Mr. Krabs: I told you not to open the door... [leans too far on SpongeBob's face] ...for anyone!
SpongeBob: [as he gets up] Yes, sir! [SpongeBob slams the door shut on Mr. Krabs, and as he walks off, Mr. Krabs falls off the door onto the ground.]
Mr. Krabs: [very weakly] Ehhh...I think the boy's got it... He, he, he...
[The scene translates to a mini montage, where SpongeBob is checking all around Mr. Krabs' house, which includes a cabinet in the kitchen, inside a glass bottle, and in Mr. Krabs' toilet in the his bathroom, just to make sure there aren't any robbers, or any signs of robbery in Mr. Krabs' house.]
SpongeBob: [while checking off ""Toilet"" on the list of things he has to check around Mr. Krabs' house] I've checked everywhere, and no sign of robbery. [He then notices the door to Mr. Krabs' bedroom.] Hmm... Mr. Krabs' bedroom. I don't remember his door being ajar. There could be robbers in there. [he remembers one of the advices Mr. Krabs said to him in a thought bubble.]
Thought Mr. Krabs: [while poking SpongeBob's nose five times] Do not step foot into me bedroom! [the thought bubble disappears]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I won't [while showing his bare feet and wiggling his toes] step foot in your bedroom. [laughs]
[SpongeBob floats in to Mr. Krabs' bedroom using a red balloon tied to his nose, without stepping foot into Mr. Krabs' bedroom.]
SpongeBob: Seems pretty clear of robbers. [SpongeBob floats to Mr. Krabs' hammock, grabs Mr. Krabs' pillow, and smells it.] Hmm, smells like Mr. Krabs. [takes some money out of the pillow] Ohhh, no wonder. [laughs] [SpongeBob puts the money back in Mr. Krabs' pillow, notices a music box next to Mr. Krabs' hammock, and floats to it.] Better check in here, too. [SpongeBob pushes a button on the music box, that automatically opens up, to discover a Mrs. Puff figurine twirling very slowly to the music that plays in the box.] Awww, so puffy! [SpongeBob then notices, and takes out a bottle of Midnight Pincer perfume.] Ohhh... Midnight Pincer. [SpongeBob sprays himself with the Midnight Pincer perfume, making him imitate Mr. Krabs, and puts the bottle right next to the music box.] It's a very romantically raving, Mrs. Puff. [SpongeBob laughs like Mr. Krabs, and when the Mrs. Puff figurine stops twirling, she closes the music box making SpongeBob return back to normal.] He, he. Nighty night, Mrs. Puff. [SpongeBob floats away from the music box and the Midnight Pincer perfume bottle, and floats to a wall full of pictures of knots.] Wow, look at Mr. Krabs' knot collection. Ohhh, that dingle-dangle should ""knot"" be there. [SpongeBob laughs as he pulls the loose string off of on of the knot pictures, that actually makes all the knot pictures magically disappear. SpongeBob looks at the end of the string, and screams in fear, noticing what he has done to Mr. Krabs' knot collection. SpongeBob grabs all of the string and puts it back on the wall as large knot, made out of string. Then, SpongeBob's red balloon pops, and SpongeBob lands on the floor using his hands, instead of his feet.] I'm still not setting ""foot"" in here! [laughs and hears the doorbell ringing.] Woo-hoo! That must be the pizza I ordered.
[SpongeBob exits Mr. Krabs' bedroom with his hands, goes downstairs, and slides to the front door using a rug.]
Pizza guy: [off-screen] Pizza delivery! [SpongeBob looks at the pizza guy using the tiny window of the door, using his eye.]
SpongeBob: I'm not allowed to open the door. [points at the mail slot part of the door] Just slide the pizza through the mail slot. [The pizza guy looks at the pizza, and then slides it through the mail slot onto a plate that SpongeBob is holding in his hands, and then he gives the pizza guy a dime through the mail slot.] And this is for you.
Pizza guy: My third mail slot delivery tonight, [leaves Mr. Krabs' house] must be a full moon.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob licks off all the cheese on the mail slot.] Ahhh...
[The scene translates to the Bikini Bottom Convention Hall, where the Fast Food Founding Fathers Convention (or the F.F.F.F. Convention) is going on. Mr. Krabs walks up to the doorman at the front door to the hall.]
Mr. Krabs: Ahem. I'm here for the Fast Food Founding Fathers Convention?
Doorman: Oh! You mean: F.F.F.F.? [brief short pause] That'll be ten cents entrance for you. [Mr. Krabs gasps very loudly in a very weird and creepy form.]
Mr. Krabs: Ten cents?!?! That's a rip off! [starts to walk away] I'm goin' home! [As Mr. Krabs walks away, a customer walks up to the doorman, and gives him ten cents.] The kind of crazy convention jerkin, dip dake, doof- [cheering can be heard in the background] Huh? Wha?
Doorman: Congratulations! You're our 100th person to enter! [gives the customer $1000] Here's a thousand dollars! [The customer walks into the hall with $1000, making Mr. Krabs extremely jealous.]
Mr. Krabs: Wha...?!
[The scene cuts off, and switches to a couple of live-action scenes. The first one being a live-action yellow fish, the second one being a coconut tumbling down a hill, the third one being a black & white wrestling match between two humans, and the fourth one, (while the scene zooms out), a chicken on a farm. When the scene zooms out, SpongeBob is changing TV channels on Mr. Krabs' TV, with the TV remote, while sitting on a couch, eating popcorn. SpongeBob changes the 4th TV channel to a black-and-white horror movie.]
TV narrator: Shocking Cinema now returns, with tonight's freighting feature... [An animated fish hook comes to the front door, of a house, and the Narrator speaks when the hook knocks at the door.] ...Knock Knock, You're Dead. [The narrator laughs evilly, as lightning strikes appear on the TV screen, and that made SpongeBob scream in fear.]
SpongeBob: I can't watch this! [SpongeBob turns off the TV with the remote, and sighs in relief, but then gets scared again when he hears someone knocking at the front door. SpongeBob comes out of hiding, goes to the wall beside the TV, and then slides to his right a little bit.]
Mr. Krabs: [off-screen] SpongeBob! [on-screen while trying to cover himself from the rain] Open up! I forgot me keys! SpongeBob! [Mr. Krabs notices some cheese remains on the mail slot, and smears it off the mail slot.] SpongeBob? [Mr. Krabs smells the remains of cheese, and tastes it a little bit.] What I've always suspected. [as a cow moos in the background] SpongeBob is made out of cheese! [starts to get worried] Or was made out of cheese... Ohhh...
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Who is it?
Mr. Krabs: It's me, Mr. Krabs! Open up, boy.
SpongeBob: You can't be Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs is at a convention, and he said not to open the door for anyone.
Mr. Krabs: [off-screen] But---uh---bub---open up!
SpongeBob: Oh, you sound like Mr. Krabs, robber, [looks through the little window on the door] but you look nothing like him.
Mr. Krabs: [while knocking on the door] Barnacles! Open up, yo- you- Huh. Aha! [Mr. Krabs laughs and grunts while going through the mail slot. Then, he falls into a puddle.]
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs notices an open window and climbs towards it.] [muttering] Ugh, and I told him to check the windows, didn't I?
SpongeBob: [On the phone] Patrick, you've gotta come over to Krabs' place. Someone's trying to break in! [Patrick mumbles] Uh, SquarePants. [Patrick mumbles again] SpongeBob SquarePants. [Patrick mumbles again] No, you're Patrick! [a realistic close-up of SpongeBob's face] Please hurry.
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs keeps climbing towards the window. Then, he notices Patrick jumping in puddles with his boots.] Huh? Patrick? What's that pink clown doing here? Eh, who cares? SpongeBob will never open the door for him.
Patrick: [Patrick gets to the door] Beep, beep, [Patrick removes his boots] beep.
Mr. Krabs: Great horn spoon! How's he doing that?
[Patrick puts his butt through the mail slot while SpongeBob pulls from the other side of the door. They both crash into the wall.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Thank goodness you don't have any bones, buddy.
Patrick: Nope, all blubber. [close-up on Patrick while he laughs]
SpongeBob: [off-screen clattering] [gasps] Someone is trying to break into Mr. Krabs' house.
Patrick: Then we'd better get over there right away! [Patrick starts to walk away]
SpongeBob: We're already here. [Patrick stops walking]
Patrick: You mean you had me walk in the rain for nothing? [Patrick looks at SpongeBob with his left eye almost closed.]
[Back outside, Mr. Krabs is still climbing towards the window.]
Mr. Krabs: [grunting] I've got it. [grunts again while lightning strikes] One little bit. There we go. Huh? [lightning strikes onto Mr. Krabs. He then falls down and screams. He then lands into a puddle.]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob and Patrick overhear Mr. Krabs] That robber doesn't sound like he's gonna give up. Let's set some traps.
[The scene translates to after SpongeBob and Patrick set up all the traps. The camera then moves to them.]
SpongeBob: Check it out, Patrick. If a robber happens to open this door, bam! This pillow will fall on their head. [The pillow gently lands on SpongeBob's head] I call it, ""Soft Justice.""
Patrick: Good one. [laughs] Look at mine! If a robber tries to come in through the window, they'll put their hand in this warm water, and they'll have to run to the bathroom! [laughs while clapping his hands]
SpongeBob: House all secure. Now we relax. [off-screen clattering] The robber! To the battle stations!
[Mr. Krabs then finds another window to climb through.]
Mr. Krabs: [grunting] There we go. [Mr. Krabs then sets off a trap] [screams] Midnight Pincer?! [calmly] It smells so wonderful, [screams again] but it burns! [Mr. Krabs wails and falls down into mud.]
Patrick: [Patrick opens a window and hits Mr. Krabs with a pillow.] Take that!
Mr. Krabs: [In the sewer] Desperate times call for desperate measures! [Mr. Krabs climbs out of the toilet]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] What the? [with plunger] Not on my watch! [SpongeBob uses the plunger to flush Mr. Krabs down the toilet.]
[Mr. Krabs shields himself from the rain and then finds a door.]
Mr. Krabs: The pet door. Why didn't I think of this before? [Mr. Krabs goes through the pet door] Oh, boy. [laughs] Huh? [He looks up and finds a sharp piece of cheese falling down him, getting ready to cut him. He screams and exits as the sharp piece of cheese cuts off his eyelashes.]
Patrick: [takes a bite of the cheese] Hmm, cheddar.
SpongeBob: Sharp cheddar. [a cow moos while a rim shot plays]
[The scene translates to Mr. Krabs looking at his house angrily]
Mr. Krabs: [angrily] That's it! Time to wreck this ball!
SpongeBob: No Mr. Krabs-impersonating robber will ever get into this house with us on the job. We're tough guys.
Patrick: Yeah. [SpongeBob and Patrick high-five then tickle each other while laughing]
SpongeBob: I feel like a tough guy action movie. [he turns on the TV]
Patrick: Oh the tougher the better buddy!
[The show is on while a tough guy runs into a brick wall then it explodes while the house was shaking]
SpongeBob: Oh yeah!
Patrick: Wow! Mr. Krabs sure has a awesome TV noise machine.
[While the house was shaking, Mr. Krabs was using a wrecking ball to destroy his house to get inside, he get on the top of the vehicle while there was thunder and he jumps onto the wrecking ball.]
Mr. Krabs: I'm coming in hot! Woohoo! [When he was about to destroy his house, the tough guy on the TV shoots a cannon ball from a cannon. Then the wrecking ball made a big hole and SpongeBob and Patrick noticed]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow! 3D!
Mr. Krabs: [he slams against the wall and gets off while mumbling. He gets trapped in a basket and slammed with a brick. He then starts crying] Oh, I give up. [he holds up a card] This proves I am the real Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: [grabs the card from Krabs' hand and reads it] Oh, heh heh. It says you're an organ donor.
Patrick: [stupidly] You play the organ?
Mr. Krabs: [snatches card from SpongeBob's hand] Give me that!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [guilty] We're sorry, Mr. Krabs! [They let him go from the trap]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, it's alright. I can't be mad at you for following my orders. You did good, boy-o. You too, Pat-o. [SpongeBob and Patrick run up to Krabs and hug him. He hears a banging on the door and gasps] The robber!
Pearl: [Outside, banging on the door] Daddy, open up! It's Pearl! I forgot my keys!
Mr. Krabs: [looks through peephole] Well, you sound like me daughter, Mr. Robber, but you look nothing like her. [he looks over to SpongeBob and Patrick, who are holding up the Midnight Pincer and the Mrs. Puff figurine, respectively.] Are those me private things?
Pearl: [banging on door and yelling] Daddy! Daddy!",0.34,Kaz

Squidward leans out of his window and screams for the duo to be quiet, threatening to call the cops on them. SpongeBob and Patrick are unable to hear the threat, so Squidward leans out of his window even harder to yell even louder. However, this causes Squidward's house to tip over and collapse, destroying the house. Squidward is saddened that his house is destroyed, so SpongeBob and Patrick offer Squidward to stay at one of their houses, but he refuses. Later that night, Squidward is seen roughing it in a tent where his house used to be, but a sudden rainstorm blows his tent away, leaving him without a shelter. Squidward finally gives in and flips a coin, making him decide to stay at Patrick's house. When Squidward approaches Patrick's house, he is dragged inside by Patrick, and is threatened by a banana Patrick is holding. Squidward identifies himself, and tells Patrick that he will be staying at his place, which thrills the latter. Patrick gives Squidward a bedroom to sleep in, but since everything in Patrick's house is made out of sand, Squidward sleeps without a pillow or blanket. However, he is unable to sleep due to Patrick drooling on his face, and when Squidward yells at him to stop, Patrick wakes up and falls on Squidward, due to thinking there are sand mites in the house.The next morning, Patrick wakes up to find that Squidward has decorated the house to his liking, and is cooking up breakfast in the kitchen. Squidward offers Patrick a lard cake, and as Patrick is about to gobble it down in one bite, Squidward stops him and shows him how to eat like a gentleman. Patrick copies Squidward's habits, making Squidward realize that he can shape Patrick to act like a ""cultured sophisticate."" A montage commences of Squidward and Patrick spending time together with various activities, including gardening, pedicures, playing clarinet, and dancing. During the montage, Patrick starts to adopt Squidward's looks, from growing two extra legs, morphing his face to look like Squidward's, and wearing a shirt instead of pants. In the next scene, Squidward and Patrick are seen opening up an attraction together called the ""Classy Kiosk,"" gathering a crowd. The duo start painting pictures, but the crowd only seems to like Patrick's pictures, buying all of them out. Squidward tries dancing to entertain the audience, but this only ends with Squidward getting hit with tomatoes. Patrick then also dances for the crowd, who end up loving it. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs go up onstage to congratulate Patrick, and Mr. Krabs comments that Patrick makes a better Squidward than Squidward does. Patrick suddenly starts adapting Squidward's mannerisms and speech patterns, making Squidward very upset, while entertaining the public at the same time.Mr. Krabs declares Patrick to be the best Squidward, as him and the crowd of people carry Patrick off. Squidward is enraged by this, claiming Patrick to be an imposter of himself. SpongeBob suggests that if Patrick makes a better Squidward, maybe Squidward will make a better Patrick. Squidward loves the idea, and thanks SpongeBob as he runs off. The next morning, Patrick (who is still acting like Squidward), wakes up to find his house to be a total mess. The cause of this is none other than Squidward (who is now purposefully acting like Patrick). Squidward does many dumb things, from slamming a brick into his face, to shoving Patrick's art up his nose, to eating Patrick's clarinet, all of which annoy and frustrate Patrick. Squidward decides to go outside and play with SpongeBob, while Patrick plans to take a nap. Unfortunately for him, he is woken up by the sound of SpongeBob and Squidward's laughing, as both of them are playing in the mud. As Patrick goes outside to yell at them, Squidward throws a handful of mud into Patrick's mouth, making Patrick remember who he used to be. Patrick changes back to normal and joins the two in the mud puddle. Just then, a helicopter is seen delivering Squidward's new house, much to the thrill of the trio. Unfortunately, his house tips over again and lands on Patrick's house, destroying both homes. In the next scene, Squidward and Patrick are both seen sleeping with SpongeBob in his bed. Squidward cries while turning off the lights, as the episode ends.",Pat Hearts Squid,"[The episode begins with a crablike creature walking along the ground. A giant mud monster arises from the ground and scares it away.]
Squidward: Be quiet down there or I'm calling the cops!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [break out of the mud monster] What?!
Squidward: [sighs] I said... [screaming loudly] be quiet, [puts his head out the window] or I'm calling the... [he loses balance, and he falls along with his entire house. The house then crumbles into pieces.] My house! My shelter! My life!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [putting their hands on Squidward's shoulders] My my my... [Squidward releases their arms]
SpongeBob: So, who you gonna stay with until you find a new house, Squidward? Me, or Patrick?
Squidward: I wouldn't stay with either of you two idiots if the entire ocean was on fire and you were the only ones with water.
Patrick: So there's a chance!
[Squidward is frustrated and pretends to open the nonexistent door to his house and slams it, making him fall to the ground. Bubble transition to a shot of Conch Street, where Squidward's house is now a tent. Squidward gargles in his mouth while in a sleeping bag and spits into a bucket.]
Squidward: Ah, roughin' it ain't so rough. [he turns off a lantern and goes to sleep]
[The wind carries the tent into the air along with Squidward's nightcap, and he wakes up. It then starts raining. ]
Squidward: Too rough! [flips a coin] Oh... I guess it's Patrick.
[Squidward zips himself up into the sleeping bag and inches towards Patrick's rock. Squidward then knocks at Patrick's rock using his nose. Patrick kidnaps Squidward by grabbing Squidward's nose.]
Patrick: [uses a banana as a weapon] Identify myself!
Squidward: [unzips his sleeping bag and sees Patrick] Patrick?
Patrick: That is correct. [phone rings] [He uses a banana as a phone.] May I ask who's calling? [He now uses the banana as his mustache.] Oh hi, Squidward! [grabs Squidward and wipes away any sand from him]
Squidward: So, um, I've decided to take you out on your generous invitation.
Patrick: What about my generator's vitamins?
Squidward: Oh, good grief. I'm staying with you, you moron! Um, that is if you'll have me?
Patrick: Oh, boy! [puts the banana in his hand and starts running in a circle around Squidward] Squidward's staying over! Squidward's staying over!
[Squidward's expression alternates between happy and concerned as Patrick repeatedly hits him with the banana. He then sighs]
[Bubble transition to Patrick leading Squidward to his bedroom.]
Patrick: You can take my bed, squiddy ol' buddy.
Squidward: Well, um, maybe it won't be so bad staying here after all.
Patrick: Sleep tight. Don't let the sand mites bite. [closes the door behind him, but then quickly reopens it, holding a hammer] But if they do, just let me know and I'll smash 'em! [closes the door again. Squidward sighs]
Squidward: [picking up the sand sandwich Patrick left for him] Um... [sniffs the sandwich; he then bites into it, and it falls to the ground like sand; the same happens with his drink. He angrily groans and tries to sleep in the sand bed, but the sheets and pillow turn into regular sand. Squidward puts on a sleeping mask and starts snoring. However, drool lands on him, and he wakes up.] Wait wha-wha-wha? Oh, a leaky rock?
[Squidward looks up to see that Patrick is sleeping on the ceiling, and the drool is coming from him. Another drop of drool lands in Squidward's eye]
Squidward: Oh, you titanic twit, get down from there!
Patrick: [waking up suddenly holding a hammer] Ah! I'll smash 'em for you, Squidward! [he then lands right on top of Squidward, making the furniture turn back into regular sand] Squidward? Where are you?
Squidward: [talking through a mouth in Patrick's stomach] In your navel. [he pops out of Patrick's stomach]
Patrick: [laughing] That tickles.
[Bubble transition; the scene changes from nighttime to dawn as a rooster makes noise.]
Patrick: [yawns, stretches, and wakes up] [The scene zooms out to show two coral plants, four clarinets, and Squidward's artwork inside his home.] Hmmm, what is this place? [Green fumes appear and trigger Patrick, who sniffs.] Huh? [The fumes come from the kitchen, where Squidward, wearing a chef's hat and apron, is preparing food from the oven.] Squidward, did you do all this?
Squidward: Well, if I figured if I have to stay here, I might as well make it livable. [shows a fully baked lard cake with the fumes] Lard cake?
Patrick: If you make me lard cakes every morning, Squiddy, you can do anything you want. [He attempts to lick the lard cake, but Squidward slaps Patrick's tongue with a wooden spoon.]
Squidward: Ah-ah-ah-ah. The etiquette spoon says, 'Eat like a gentleman.'
Patrick: Ah. A gentleman! [eats the etiquette spoon]
Squidward: Watch me, idiot. [takes a small piece of the lard cake with a fork] A gentleman eats like this. [bites the cake piece repeatedly]
[Patrick does exactly what Squidward did]
Squidward: Holy halibut. Can he actually be taught? [molds Patrick's head] I can mold you. [squeezes Patrick's head] I can squeeze this lump of clay [molds Patrick's head into Bold and Brash] into a cultured sophisticate! [stretches Patrick's face into a donut] I will make you the most tolerable roommate of all time! [squeezes Patrick one last time] You'll be my roommate-sterpiece!
Patrick: [holding up his fork] More lard cake, please!
[Bubble transition to Squidward's garden.]
[Squidward pulls out a small purple carrot from the ground. Patrick pulls a much larger orange carrot out of his nose. Squidward gives the orange carrot a blue ribbon.]
[Bubble transition to the two now at a spa.]
[Squidward lifts his tentacles up, which are now shiny. Patrick lifts his two legs up, knocking the lady who was doing his manicure up into the air; he grows two extra legs]
[Bubble transition to the two of them now on top of Patrick's rock with clarinets. Squidward plays his clarinet beautifully, and then Patrick plays his terribly. Patrick then takes a deep breath and releases a sour note from his clarinet, which then punches him in the face, giving him a Squidward-like face. The two of them clink their clarinets]
[Bubble transition to the two now next to a mirror in Patrick's rock.]
Squidward: Hmm... [his head turns into a lightbulb] Aha! [he takes off Patrick's clothes and puts then on his torso.] Mwah.
Patrick: Mwah. [the two then start dancing together]
[Bubble transition to Patrick's rock opening up to reveal a circus tent, labeled ""Classy Kiosk"". Squidward and Patrick are both playing clarinets. A crowd has gathered around them.]
Patrick: Culture lovers, welcome to the Classy Kiosk!
Squidward: I am Squidtacular, and this is my protege, Patrick Panache!
Patrick: He taught me everything I blow! [plays his clarinet terribly; Squidward gives him a cookie]
Squidward: And now, get ready to...
Squidward and Patrick: Feel the art!
[The two of them start painting the easels nearby. Squidward finishes his paintings, and the audience boos. Patrick finishes his paintings, and the audience is awed. The crowd starts giving Patrick money and take Patrick's paintings]
Squidward: What?! Hey, watch me, everyone! I will now bedazzle your dazzlers with interpretive dance!
[Squidward starts doing some interpretive dance moves, with his last move from the ""Culture Shock"" episode. After he is done, like in ""Culture Shock"", a tomato is thrown at his face.]
Patrick: My turn! [he starts doing his own interpretive dance, and after he is done, the audience throws him lots of roses]
Squidward: What the?
Mr. Krabs: [teary-eyed] Who knew that Patrick could dance like an angel? Oh, bravo! Bravo!
SpongeBob: [picking up a tomato] Oh, Mr. Krabs, you dropped this.
Mr. Krabs: [quickly puts the tomato in his shirt, nervously chuckling]
SpongeBob: Patrick Panache! Patrick Panache!
Mr. Krabs: [poking Patrick] You make a better Squidward than Squidward does! [laughs]
Patrick: [imitating Squidward] I do? [laughs like Squidward, then sighs like him; the audience and Mr. Krabs laugh]
Squidward: [slaps Patrick] Hey! Stop making those noises! Those are my noises! [sighs]
[Patrick sighs like Squidward. Squidward makes an angry noise, and Patrick follows. This repeats a few times]
Mr. Krabs: Hey! Patrick is the best Squidward! [raising Patrick's arm; the audience cheers]
Audience member: Hooray! [they then start carrying Patrick]
SpongeBob: So Squidward, what do you think of your new protege, huh?
Squidward: [growling through teeth] New protege? [a steaming thought bubble containing moldy cheese forms above his head] [normally] He stinks! And he's not a better me! He's an impostor!
SpongeBob: Hmm. Well, if Patrick makes a better Squidward, then you'd make a better... [forms a Patrick Star shape with his hands] ...Patrick! [laughs]
Squidward: [scoffs] Yeah, right. I would make a better Patrick. [he has an epiphany] Wait a minute, that's it! That'll teach him! [grabs SpongeBob] Oh, thanks, SpongeBob! [kisses him and runs off]
[the moldy cheese from the thought bubble falls to the ground, and SpongeBob picks it up]
SpongeBob: Oh, wait a minute, Squidward! You dropped your chee- [the stench of the cheese gets to him and a cow moos as SpongeBob falls to the ground]
French Narrator: [reading time card] Zee next morning... [rooster crows and alarm rings]
Patrick: [wakes up and stretches, talks like Squidward] Well, Patrick, time for another lovely day in the flower garden of life. [gets up, and notices that his home is now a mess]
Squidward: [He resembles Patrick, now having a pointy head, only two legs, and wearing Patrick's pants instead of his shirt. He holds a brick.] I love you brick! [smashes his head into the brick] I love you brick! [smashes his head into the brick again] I love you brick! [smashes his head into the brick for a third time]
Patrick: [takes the brick off Squidward's face, talking like Squidward] Squidward, you kelp head, what did you do to my beautiful house?!
Squidward: Define ""do"". [shoves a Squidward-like Patrick figurine up his nose]
Patrick: [He screams and takes the figurine off Squidward's nose, revealing Squidward's brain on top. He continues talking like Squidward] Don't put my art up your nose, you cretin!
Squidward: [takes back his brain on top of the figurine with his tongue and eats it] I might need that someday. Duh!
Patrick: [talking like Squidward] Ugh... [he puts the figurine on a sand table] I'll play the old licorice stick. That always soothes my nerves. [he opens a clarinet case to see that his clarinet is missing, and gasps]
Squidward: [eats the clarinet] Doesn't taste like licorice.
Patrick: [talking like Squidward] My clarinet! Noo!
Squidward: [spits out clarinet bits] Oh, sorry. You want some?
Patrick: [slaps the clarinet bits out of Squidward's hand with the wooden etiquette spoon, talking like Squidward] Ah-ah-ah. The etiquette spoon came back and he says, 'Eat like a gentleman.'
Squidward: [He eats one of the clarinet valves in a ""gentlemanly"" manner he learned previously while suddenly hears SpongeBob laughing off-screen.] Umm... ummm... I'm going to go play with my best friend SpongeBob. [laughs like Patrick and runs out]
Patrick: [talking like Squidward] Yeah, you do that. While I take a Pat-nap. [walks to his couch, lays down, and sleeps. Suddenly, he hears laughing coming from SpongeBob and Squidward] What are those ninnies up to now?! [Outside of Patrick's house, SpongeBob and Squidward appear to play in a mud puddle, with SpongeBob blowing a mud bubble.]
SpongeBob: [chuckles] I told you you'd make a great Patrick, Squidward! [Squidward laughs]
Patrick: [opens his window, talking like Squidward] Pipe down, you two!
Squidward: Hey Patrick, hands up! [holds a piece of mud and throws it at Patrick's face]
SpongeBob and Squidward: Bullseye! [both laugh]
Patrick: [talking like Squidward] I said, be quiet, you two, or I'm calling the- [a piece of mud is thrown at Patrick's mouth and swallows it, causing him to return to his normal voice.] Mud... puddle! [Patrick makes noises as he transforms himself back into his original-self] Hi-huh! [He jumps into a mud puddle and splashes the screen]
Squidward: [spits out mud] He's Patrick again! Finally!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward, look! [A helicopter carrying Squidward's new house appears, Squidward transforms back into his original-self, being naked without his pants]
Squidward: It's the new house I ordered! No more Patrick! [The helicopter drops Squidward's house on the ground]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Yeah! [suddenly, Squidward's new house leans over to Patrick's house and they both crumble into pieces]
Squidward: Huh? [He falls into the mud puddle, which covered SpongeBob and Patrick in mud.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Woohoo!
[Bubble transition to a shot of SpongeBob's house in the evening where SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are going to sleep.]
Patrick: [off-screen] Goodnight, SpongeBob. [cut to inside SpongeBob's bedroom]
SpongeBob: Goodnight, Patrick.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Goodnight, Squidward. Mwah. [They kiss Squidward, who then begins to sob uncontrollably, then claps his hands twice to turn off the lights, ending the episode.]",0.56,Doug Lawrence

He then goes into his office, steals a strawberry ice cream sandwich from Squidward's lunch, and takes off his shell before going into a tanning booth in his room as part of him getting ready for his date with Mrs. Puff. While SpongeBob is serving a Krabby Patty to Patrick, he hears Mr. Krabs saying it is hot in his office. Thinking that he is in trouble, he goes inside, only to see Mr. Krabs' shell empty and the melted ice cream sandwich, which he thinks is blood, all over him.SpongeBob gets sad, fearing Mr. Krabs has died from exsanguination, but when Squidward hears about this, knowing the truth about Mr. Krabs, decides to play along. When he tells them Mr. Krabs had a date, SpongeBob gets the idea to fill the shell with chum so he can still go to the date. He, as well as Patrick, go to his house after buying chum from Plankton, and fill the shell with the chum as organs.Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs gets out of the tanning booth, only to realize his shell is gone. He tries to go to his house without being seen to get clothes, but upon reaching there, Pearl and her friends see him naked. At the same time, SpongeBob and Patrick have taught Chum Krabs everything he needs to know for the date. They send him to Mrs. Puff's house to bring her to Fancy!, right before the real Mr. Krabs arrives to do the same thing.While Mrs. Puff and Chum Krabs are on a date, Mr. Krabs goes to Fancy! so he can have the date. Upon seeing Chum Krabs with his date, he gets angry and tries to stop the imposter. Noticing this, SpongeBob and Patrick grab Mr. Krabs and throw him out of the restaurant believing he's an impostor, only for Squidward to arrive and tell the two the Mr. Krabs they threw out was the real one, and takes the opportunity to mock his tuxedo as payback for stealing his lunch before leaving. Realizing his mistake, SpongeBob apologizes to Mr. Krabs and explains the situation. Chum Krabs then comes out of the restaurant with Mrs. Puff, and Mr. Krabs gets into a fight with him, knocking him out of his shell.Chum Krabs soon gains the upper hand, but he can't maintain his shape without the shell and melts, allowing Mr. Krabs to win the fight, and he and Mrs. Puff get back together, while SpongeBob and Patrick get taken by the remains of Chum Krabs, as the episode ends.",My Two Krabses,"[The episode starts off at the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: Ah, it's finally my lunchtime. [picking up his lunch] My only respite from these cretins and all the slop they call food.
Patrick: [laughs, eats his lunch, and burps it out] Hello!
Squidward: [groans] Well, let's see what delectable treats I packed myself today.
Mr. Krabs: Yoink! [Mr. Krabs grabs Squidward's treats] You know the rules, no outside food in me restaurant. [opens his office door] Oh, and, uh, Mr. Squidward, I've got a hot date tonight. So don't let no one bother me for the next few hours. I'm gonna be in the tanning bed, browning the leather. [spanks himself] [laughs and shuts the door]

Squidward: [groans]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah... lemme see here. [pulls out a box of dried kelp strips] Hmm... dried kelp strips? Nah. [tosses the box and grabs a bottle of sea water] Reduced fat sea water? That's weird. [tosses the bottle and pulls out a strawberry ice cream sandwich] Jackpot! Ice cream sandwich!
[Mr. Krabs tosses the bag, takes a bite from the ice cream sandwich, and opens the desk, revealing a tanner inside. He then spins the ice cream sandwich on his finger, then unzips and exits his shell. He puts on goggles and headphones, kicks the ice cream sandwich on the shell's finger, still spinning, and shell-less Mr. Krabs enters the tanner.]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, nice and toasty in here. [points to shell] I'll be back for you later.
[Mr. Krabs closes his desk, and the sandwich falls on the shell. The ice cream starts to melt inside the shell. The scene cuts to SpongeBob, who opens the kitchen door.]
SpongeBob: [singing] I got a Krabby Patty for my favorite Pat! A patty-pat, for my favorite Pat! [SpongeBob sets the Krabby Patty on the table] Here you go, Patrick.
[Patrick eats the patty.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, mama, it's hot in here!
Patrick: What was that?
Mr. Krabs: [as rave music plays in the tanning bed] Oh, Neptune, I'm melting!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs' air conditioning must be malfunctioning! He could be violently uncomfortable!
[SpongeBob kicks the door to Mr. Krabs' office open, and he and Patrick run inside the office.]
Squidward: [sarcastically] No, wait. Don't.
SpongeBob: [screams as he sees Mr. Krabs' shell with melted ice cream] Mr. Krabs! Are you okay? [starts to cry] Oh, speak to me...
[A shot of Mr. Krabs is shown dancing in the tanning bed]
[SpongeBob cries]
Patrick: This doesn't look good. [he grabs some of the melted ice cream] He melted all over the floor. [eats the melted ice cream] Hmm, strawberry! Poor guy.
SpongeBob: [cries while he and Patrick take Mr. Krabs' shell to the cash register] Oh, Mr. Krabs! A tasty puddle... He's-he's-he's dead! [cries in the cash register, as Squidward takes a look at Mr. Krabs' shell]
Squidward: [laughs] Oh, oh, look at that. And right before his big date tonight.  What a shame.
SpongeBob: A date? [A heart appears in the top of SpongeBob's hands] Oh, must love die meltily in my arms too? [the heart melts in SpongeBob's hands and he continues crying]
Squidward: I guess he's just an empty shell of the man used to be. [snickers]
SpongeBob: [stops crying] Hey, Squidward, you're right! Only Mr. Krabs' insides melted, his shell is fine! Maybe if we fill this back up with organs, he'll be okay.
[SpongeBob and Patrick runs off with Mr. Krabs' shell.]
Squidward: Say what now?
[The scene cuts to the Chum Bucket.]
SpongeBob: Plankton!
Plankton: I didn't do it!
SpongeBob: We would like to purchase one large drum of chum, please.
Patrick: Extra organ-y.
Plankton: Say what? How do I know this isn't a plot to steal my secret chum formula? [a brief short pause occurs, and after that, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Plankton all laugh, and SpongeBob gives Plankton some money, and he takes it.] Yoink! [Karen takes out the Drum of Chum through the door.] Enjoy your chum drum. Yum, yum!
SpongeBob: Thanks, Plankton! Love you!
[Bubble transition to the inside of SpongeBob's house.]
SpongeBob: Well, alright. Let's put some [kicks his foot] kick back in this crab!
[SpongeBob takes off the lid of the drum with his foot, and while he holds Mr. Krabs' shell mouth open, Patrick grabs the chum drum and tries to put it in but makes a mess all over the walls and the floor, then, he puts it in his mouth, and pushes it in, which it doesn't work, so Patrick kicks it.]
SpongeBob: Hmm, we're still missing something... [he gets an idea and snaps his fingers] Oh! [SpongeBob takes off his shoes and starts rubbing his socks on the floor to produce electricity.] A little zaparooni ought to do it. The spark of life! Doot! [SpongeBob points at Mr. Krabs' shell with chum and zaps it. And soon, the chum from the chum drum starts to fill all around the shell, creating a creature] He's alive! He's alive! Oh, he's alive!
[Patrick and SpongeBob walk up to Chum Krabs, and Patrick looks very closely at him with his one big eye.]
Patrick: Mr. Krabs seems... kind of dumb now.
SpongeBob: Well Patrick, he has had a rough day. We'll just have to remind him of everything that makes him him again. [slaps Chum Krabs on the shoulder] Don't you worry, Mr. K. We'll have you right back up to speed before your big date tonight, I promise.
Chum Krabs: [mumbles]
[Bubble transition back to Mr. Krabs in the tanner at the Krusty Krab. A pop-up thermometer comes out of Mr. Krabs' side, indicating he's done.]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, I'm done. [Mr. Krabs opens the tanner and feels around for his shell, but it is not there so he pops out.] Oh, where'd me shell go? I'm never that careless with me carapace. [watch beeps] Oh no, I'm running late! Just have to grab me spare suit from home. [He peers out of the door and sees the restaurant is packed.] Let's see, if I time this right, no one'll notice me ol' naked nethers. [He jumps behind the customers and stays out of sight behind a baby carrier. The baby begins to cry, and the mother takes it out, and then he hides behind Bubble Bass. He successfully makes it outside, looks around, and hides behind the signpost. Then he runs off, hiding behind buildings.]
[Bubble transition back to SpongeBob's house where he and Patrick are sitting at a table with Chum Krabs and a Pearl mannequin. On the table sits a pile of money and a plate of cookies.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Mr. Krabs, this is your final test. What do you like more: money or cookies?
[Chum Krabs begins to point.]
Patrick: Don't say cookies, don't say cookies, don't say cookies.
[Chum Krabs points to the money, which makes SpongeBob and Patrick smile.]
Chum Krabs: Money.
SpongeBob: Right! You're all ready for your date with Mrs. Puff!
[SpongeBob and Patrick, who ate all the cookies, cheer ""Hooray!"", while Chum Krabs makes babbling noises. The next scene shows the real Mr. Krabs, still without his shell, going back into his house, trying to make sure no one sees him as he does so.]
Mr. Krabs: Haha! I made it! [suddenly, the lights turn on]
Pearl: Ew, Daddy! [Pearl's friends are having a slumber party.] You're naked and ruining my cheerleader's slumber party! [Pearl covers her eyes, as Mr. Krabs screams and tries to cover himself]
Pearl's friends: [cheerleading] Hey, hey, hey, Mr. K! We don't want to see your booty today!
[Mr. Krabs screams and runs upstairs and looks for something to wear.]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, I know that spare is in here somewhere. [he rummages through his wardrobes and finds a shirt] Aha! [the shirt is too small] Ew, haven't worn this one in a while. Eh, well it'll just have to do. I'm coming, me precious Puff! [runs out the door, only to be spotted by Pearl and her friends again, who scream]
Pearl: Daddy!
[The next scene shows SpongeBob and Patrick bringing Chum Krabs to Mrs. Puff's house.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Mr. Krabs, here we are. Just remember everything we practiced and your date will go just fine. Good luck!
Patrick: Yeah, don't blow it!
[SpongeBob rings the doorbell, and he and Patrick hide behind a rock. Inside, Mrs. Puff is looking at herself in a mirror.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Is that you, Eugene?
Chum Krabs: Y…
SpongeBob: [whispering] Yes!
Chum Krabs: Yes!
Mrs. Puff: Well, [looks at her watch] you're right on time for once! What a treat!
Chum Krabs: Yes.
Mrs. Puff: [laughs] And so agreeable tonight! [they begin to walk off]
Chum Krabs: Yes.
[SpongeBob and Patrick jump out from behind the rock.]
SpongeBob: [with a tear in his eye] Oh, Patrick, Mr. Krabs may be the one we brought back to life, but it's love we saved tonight. [he and Patrick grab onto the back of their boatmobile, as the real Mr. Krabs runs to Mrs. Puff's house, panicking. He starts banging on the door. ]
Mr. Krabs: Puff! Puff! You in there? I'm sorry I'm late for our date! [the door falls off, as Mr. Krabs gasps] Empty! She must be waiting for me at the restaurant! [gasps] I hope she's waiting for me. [runs] Puff!
[The next scene shows the Fancy! restaurant, with Mrs. Puff and Chum Krabs sitting together.]
Mrs. Puff: [sighs] You know, there's something different about you tonight, Eugene. You've been such a good listener. [Chum Krabs sits there, not saying anything.] And that manly new musk you're wearing. [sniffs] Oh, my!
Chum Krabs: [emits odor, and a foghorn sounds. He smells it too.] Chum.
Mrs. Puff: [laughs] I think we're way past being chums, Eugene. [she kisses Chum Krabs, as SpongeBob and Patrick watch.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, Patrick, their date is going great!
Fancy fish: [appearing behind SpongeBob as he speaks] I say, do you mind?
[Mr. Krabs runs up to the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: [breathing heavily] Don't worry! I'm here, me puffy princess! [he looks inside and sees Mrs. Puff and Chum Krabs having a good time] What?! Who is that clown clawing at me woman?! [he jumps onto the glass, burning it, and he slides through, crushing the table] What in Davy Jones' gym locker is going on here?!
SpongeBob: [still watching] Who was that?
Patrick: I don't know, but we'd better stop him before he ruins everything!
[SpongeBob and Patrick jump onto the table, crashing it, and taking Mr. Krabs out.]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs! Sorry, Mrs. Puff! Enjoy the rest of your date! [SpongeBob and Patrick throw the real Mr. Krabs out]
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing, boy-o? It's me, Mr. Krabs! Your lovesick employer-er!
SpongeBob: Lovesick employer? Clever imposter, you mean!
Squidward: [walks past, notices Mr. Krabs, and laughs] That's the real Mr. Krabs, you idiots! [laughs] Oh, and Eugene, your teenage self called. He wants his prom tux back! [pokes Mr. Krabs, laughs, and walks off]
[Mr. Krabs is angry.]
SpongeBob: Sorry, sir! We thought you had melted, and so we brought you back to life in chum. [laughs] Anybody would have done the same thing.
Mr. Krabs: [stutters] Melted? Chum? What are you going on about, boy-o?
[Mrs. Puff and Chum Krabs walk out of the restaurant together. Mrs. Puff laughs, as Chum Krabs talks gibberish. When Mr. Krabs sees this, he pushes SpongeBob and Patrick out of the way.]
Mr. Krabs: [to Chum Krabs] Get your mitts of me gal, bucko! [attempts to punch Chum Krabs]
Mrs. Puff: Ooh! You're not going to take that from a stranger, are you, Eugene? Fight for my love! [she pushes Chum Krabs, and he and the real Mr. Krabs get into a fight, as SpongeBob and Patrick try to stop them]
SpongeBob: Stop! This is all a big misunderstanding- [Mr. Krabs punches SpongeBob and Patrick, as they fall, and Chum Krabs gets up and releases chum in his mouth, and beats Mr. Krabs in the head, and starts to beat him up more, and pokes his eyes]
Mr. Krabs: Hey!
[Mr. Krabs gets his claws out, and attempts to cut Chum Krabs' chum, but more comes out. Chum Krabs swallows them, and they bump into each other, as the chum in Mr. Krabs' shell comes out, and picks up Mr. Krabs, and starts to move him around.]
Mr. Krabs: [groans] I lost the fight and me Puff. [Chum Krabs is still picking up Mr. Krabs, before he melts, and Mr. Krabs falls down] I win! Well, kind of. [falls, exhausted]
Mrs. Puff: [putting Mr. Krabs back in his shell] Sorry, Eugene. I guess I couldn't see past your handsome exterior. [zips up the shell]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, baby. It's okay. [wipes some chum off his shell] Sure hope I can get this stink out of me shell. [chuckles]
Mrs. Puff: [walks off with Mr. Krabs] I like it! [SpongeBob attempts to clean up chum from the ground, and puts it in a bucket.]
SpongeBob: Sorry about the mix-up, Chummy. You may not be Mr. Krabs, but you can still be our friend!
Chum Krabs: Friends. [hugs SpongeBob and Patrick, as the three of them laugh, before being sucked into the bucket of chum, which the camera irises out on, ending the episode.]",0.68,Andrew Goodman

When he pretends to be a ghost, he gets an idea to steal the secret formula. After Karen unplugs herself, Plankton creates a ghost extracting machine, and turns into a ghost. By being a ghost, he can go through walls, which is how he got into the safe in the Krusty Krab. However, by being a ghost, he can go through walls, but he cannot pick things up either, leading to what seems to be a failure.That is when the Flying Dutchman appears on Mr. Krabs' chair, cackling, and tells Plankton that it takes some training to pick things up, and he picks up the bottle on his first try. So the training begins.First off, the Flying Dutchman tells Plankton that he needs to learn the art of shapeshifting, in which one should think of a scary thought, and then they become that scary thought. The Flying Dutchman turns into multiple scary things, and then it is Plankton's turn. He turns into a weird shape, but since it is not scary, he becomes a duplicate of the Flying Dutchman. Accepting the pupil's talent, the Flying Dutchman whacks him with a mallet. They move on to lesson two.In order to be a proper ghost, one has to scare others. The Flying Dutchman scares the life out of a thief, and when Plankton does his scare, he accidentally scares himself through a mirror. The Flying Dutchman accepts it, hits him with a golf club, and they move on to lesson three.For this lesson, one has to make another's life a nightmare by haunting their house. The Flying Dutchman and Plankton go over to Squidward's house, and the haunting begins. Plankton becomes Squidward's bed and shakes, waking Squidward up. When he finds out his bed is haunted, Squidward hides in the dresser, with his clarinet. But he plays his clarinet badly, and a few seconds later, an annoyed Plankton pulls the clarinet from Squidward and morphs into a SpongeBob ghost, and becomes visible. Squidward tries to escape, but knocks himself unconscious. Plankton, realizing he took the clarinet, finds out that he can pick things up now. They move onto the final lesson.In this final lesson, the Flying Dutchman tells Plankton that he has to be really angry in order to pick something up. On a second attempt to steal the formula, Plankton picks it up just fine after hearing the Dutchman's advice. However, when he tries to take it out of the safe, the bottle will not go through the wall, as it is not a ghost. After admitting defeat, he decides to go back to his regular body.But when he enters the Chum Bucket, he is surprised to find out that Karen had invited everyone to Plankton's funeral because he left his body alone for too long. His corpse lay on a coffin, and Plankton feels like getting into his body when the Flying Dutchman says he is dead forever. Plankton denies it, saying he is only a ""temporary"" ghost, but an eager Flying Dutchman goes into Plankton's body to be alive again. Believing that Plankton played a cruel joke by pretending to be dead, all the mourners, except SpongeBob, get real angry. They form a mob and stomp on the Flying Dutchman in Plankton's body. He decides to give up and give Plankton his body back stating that the Flying Dutchman would rather be dead than alive. Plankton happily accepts, and even after being stomped multiple times by the people, he says that it is good to be alive. To end the episode, the Flying Dutchman does a jump scare in front of a ""The End"" card.",The Ghost of Plankton,"[The episode begins at a spooky haunted house. A scared woman frantically runs from an old lady ghost. She goes to hide in a room and locks the door. However, the ghost floats through the door and corners her inside.]
Unnamed woman: Grandma! No! [screams as the ghost engulfs around her]
[The screen pans out to reveal it is just a scary horror movie Plankton is watching from Karen's monitor.]
Plankton: [laughs] Get her, Grandma! [laughs as he spills the popcorn and gets covered in the blanket] I'm the ghost of Plankton! Wooo! [trips over the sofa's armrest, removes his blanket and a lightbulb lights up above him] Hey, that gives me an idea. [hops onto Karen and changes the screen to make the blueprint of his plan] Hmm, if I were a ghost, I could walk right through the walls of the Krusty Krab and take the Krabby Patty secret formula! [giggles]
Karen: [turns the lights on and shakes the blueprint screen off] Ah! All right, that's it! You ruined another movie night with your secret formula garbage. [drops Plankton] I'm pulling the plug. [pulls the plug and shuts herself off]
Plankton: [groans as he stand up; waves his hand in anger] Ah. Let's see. Now all I need to do is invent a... [pulls a red curtain for a few seconds and pulls it back to reveal a skull-shaped machine] Ghost extracting machine! [laughs as he turns on the machine and hops in]
[Two robot arms come down with a squeezer tube for icing bags. They put it on Plankton's head then roll him up like a tube of toothpaste. Out of the squeezer is a green substance. It floats up and morphs into Plankton. Plankton has now become a ghost.]
Plankton: [looks at his dead body and whistles] I look like I just saw a ghost. [flies through the Chum Bucket doors and laughs] Success! [floats over to the Krusty Krab, flies through the front doors, and happily goes into the safe in Mr. Krabs' office] You gotta give up the ghost if you wanna make toast. [tries to pick up the secret formula, but fails] What?! [tries it numerous times, but also fail] No, no, no! Stupid ghost hands! [sobs frantically at his unsuccessful attempt until he hears laughing outside] What? [comes out of the safe and sees the Flying Dutchman laughing hysterically] What's so funny? Stupid ghost!
Flying Dutchman: You are, that's what. You can't just float in on your first day and pick things up. [laughs as he shrinks down to Plankton’s size; then he floats into the safe and picks up the bottle] Here you go. [the bottle floats through Plankton] Oh, grab it. [taunts Plankton with the bottle] Grab it! Get it! [laughs]
Plankton: I can't grab it! [wheezes]
Flying Dutchman: I like you, squirt. I got a soft spot in me dead heart for thieves [opens his chest, pokes a hole in his old heart and it deflates] I can teach you how to pick things up.
Plankton: [squeals happily] I love you.
Flying Dutchman: But first, you need to learn the ""basics"" of being a ghost.
[Plankton and the Flying Dutchman share a good laugh. The Flying Dutchman magically makes a gong appear and rings it onto Plankton.]
Flying Dutchman: First lesson... Shape-shifting. [cuts to behind the Krusty Krab] Shape-shifting is one of the easiest things a ghost can do. You just have to think of a horrible thing and poof! [changes into a monster, a walrus, a rattlesnake, a bat, and a Pearl look-alike]
Flying Dutchman (in Pearl’s voice): You become it!
[Plankton screams in terror at the Flying Dutchman's shape-shifting abilities.]
Flying Dutchman: [changes back] Now, you try.
[Plankton gives his shape-shifting ability a try. However, he turns into an odd-looking shape.]
Plankton: I did it!
Flying Dutchman: [facepalms in annoyance] That's not horrible! What were you thinking?! [takes out a sprayer and sprays Plankton] Bad ghost! Bad!
[Plankton coughs and changes into an exact copy of the Flying Dutchman, but with one eye.]
Flying Dutchman: Hmm. Now, that's horrible!
Plankton: Now, can you teach me how to pick things up?
Flying Dutchman: Not yet. [snaps his fingers as a mallet appears and whacks Plankton on the head] Next lesson, scaring. [cuts to a dark alley] Pay close attention, squirt. This is how you scare someone.
[A robber runs down the alley with a bag of money. He hears some scary noises from behind and becomes scared. Just as he turns around, the Flying Dutchman lets out a devastating roar and makes a horrifying face. The robber screams in fright as his clothes, skin, muscles, and skeleton fall apart, leaving only his brain, eyes and nervous system. Then he turns around and runs away.]
Plankton: Okay, my turn! [gives the Flying Dutchman a friendly punch in the stomach] Shh. Someone's coming. [floats toward a mirror] Watch me scare this dummy real good.
[Plankton turns around and makes a scary face while roaring real loud. But it turns out that he's scaring his own reflection. He screams in terror as his ghost skin splits apart, leaving his ghost skeleton and ghost eye. He floats behind the Flying Dutchman.]
Flying Dutchman: Well, you scared yourself. I guess that counts. [takes out a golf club] Next lesson. [hits Plankton's ghost skeleton and ghost eye back into his ghost body] Haunting houses. [cuts to Squidward's house as thunder roars in background and Squidward is sleeping in his bed] All right, pupil, it's time to apply all you've learned and frighten this guy's legs off.
Plankton: With pleasure.
[Plankton floats into Squidward's bed and possesses it like a puppet. The bed turns green and the box spring turns into Plankton's head. Plankton's eye appears about Squidward. Plankton shakes the bed and chuckles evilly as Squidward begins to wake up.]
Squidward: [screams] Who's there? Ohh, is that you, SpongeBob? [gets up and gets drenched on by green ectoplasm]
[Squidward removes his blindfold and becomes freaked out by the ectoplasm. Suddenly, the box spring forms into a giant mouth and makes an evil laugh. Squidward becomes so scared that his skin turned white. He tries to escape, but Plankton pulled him under the covers. Squidward releases himself from the covers and hides in the drawers.]
Flying Dutchman: [writing down his clipboard] Oooh. Monster mouth with a bucket of ghost goo—very good marks. [chuckles] Nice haunt, swabby!
Squidward: [comes out of the drawer with his clarinet and pants heavily] Oh, what a terrible nightmare. Oh, thanks for being here, Clarry. You'll keep the monsters away. [inhales and blows horrible music out through his clarinet]
[Squidward's clarinet playing drives Plankton and the Flying Dutchman crazy. Plankton floats over to Squidward and grabs the clarinet.]
Plankton: Give me that!
Squidward: Clarry!
[Squidward and Plankton get into a tug-o-war with the clarinet. Plankton turns into a ghostly SpongeBob and scares Squidward, whose eyes pop out and scream. Squidward runs out of the drawers and gets hit in the head when he crashed into the ceiling. Squidward falls down to the floor and is knocked out unconscious. Plankton throws the clarinet away and changes back.]
Plankton: Hey, I picked something up! I can pick things up! [picks up a vase and drops it]
Flying Dutchman: Look at you. You skipped ahead to the last lesson! [pulls out a mallet]
Plankton: It's okay. You don't have to— [gets hit by the mallet]
Flying Dutchman: Last lesson! How to pick things up. [cuts to Plankton and the Flying Dutchman exiting Squidward's house] As you discovered, to pick things up, you gotta get [gets fired up] really angry!
Plankton: Why didn't you say that before in the first place, moron?!
Flying Dutchman: I have nothing left to teach you. [tips his hat and bows]
Plankton: Oh, yeah? [forms into a ghostly mallet and hits the Flying Dutchman in the head]
Flying Dutchman: [sniffs] My boy.
[Plankton laughs and re-enters the Krusty Krab to try to steal the formula again. He makes an evil laugh and warms himself up.]
Plankton: Oh, I'm really angry! Here we go! [floats into Mr. Krabs' office] Yup! [enlarges his hand and successfully grabs the bottle; he lets out a happy squeal and laughs; then he tries to take it out, but the bottle is too solid] Blasted bottle! It's always something! [the Flying Dutchman laughs] What?
Flying Dutchman: Guess you didn't think that one through all the way, did ya?
Plankton: Dead jerk. [floats away in anger as the Flying Dutchman laughs; he exits the Krusty Krab] Well, I'm calling it. This ghost racket is for the birds. I'm going back to my body where I belong. Hmph! [goes back to the Chum Bucket and sees the light lit inside] Huh? I don't remember leaving the lights on. [enters the Chum Bucket] Wha—huh?! [much to his shocking dismay, he sees a funeral of himself being held; he sees his dead body in a small coffin] Yeesh. You can't leave your own carcass alone for ten minutes in this town!
Karen: And now, if anyone has anything nice to say about Sheldon, this would be the time.
[Tom snickers silently, but a mourner behind tells him to be quiet.]
SpongeBob: [walks up to the altar in tears] Um, Plankton was small and... [sniffs] And green and... Loud! [cries hysterically]
Karen: [comforts SpongeBob as she and Patrick take him back to his seat] All right, come on. It's okay.
Plankton: Yeesh. This is the worst funeral of mine I've ever been to. [grins evilly] But watch these idiots scream when I get back into my body and jump out of that coffin.
Flying Dutchman: [laughs as he appears through the floor in his ship] Ya can't go back in your body now . You're dead, ya dodo!
Plankton: I'm not dead. I'm just a temporary ghost. My body is in suspended animation, that's all.
Flying Dutchman: [giggles as he floats over to Plankton's dead body] You mean, this is an empty vessel? I haven't possessed a body in years!
Plankton: You can't do that! That's my body!
Flying Dutchman: Not anymore! [floats into Plankton's dead body and opens his eye; he sits himself up] Rarg! I'm alive! It's great to be back!
[All the mourners who attended Plankton's funeral gasp in a horrified surprise.]
Plankton: No!
Flying Dutchman: [jumps off the table and dances around on the floor] Ta-da!
SpongeBob: [sniffles as he cries a coffin full of tears; he stops crying] Plankton's alive? Hooray!
Karen: [angrily closes the coffin on SpongeBob] I knew it!
Incidental 67: He's alive?!
[All of the mourners get really angry. They assume that Plankton had been playing a cruel joke on them by pretending to be dead.]
Old Man Jenkins: Let's squash him!
[All the mourners gather around the Flying Dutchman in Plankton's body and prepare to attack him as payback for supposedly tricking them.]
Flying Dutchman: [continues dancing around] ♪Dee, dee, dee, dee, da, da, dee, dee, dee, da!♪ [stops dancing as he sees an angry mob around him] Wuh-oh. [screams in an attempt to scare them; but fails] Eh? Reowr? [the angry mob starts crushing him with their feet]
Plankton: Oh! I can't watch them do that to me!
Flying Dutchman: [escapes the angry mob and removes Plankton's dead body] Here! Take it! [gives Plankton his dead body] Those people are angry. Whew! I never thought I'd say this, but I'd rather be a dead me than an alive you. Bye! [disappears]
Plankton: [reenters his dead body and checks to see if everything is fitted; he sighs in relief] My body feels great!
Incidental 178: There he is!
[The angry mob gather around Plankton with angry looks on their faces.]

His sister Squidina gets annoyed and calls security to kick him out. Outside, Patrick sees two of the workers at Goofy Goobers receiving ice cream on their break, prompting him to apply for the job.The manager of the place shows Patrick the history of Goofy Goobers, as well as what he needs to do to be a good employee. He first tasks Patrick to clean the dishes. After they are all cleaned, the manager asks him how he cleaned them. Patrick says he cleaned them using his saliva, disgusting the manager.The manager gives Patrick his next job, which is to unload ice cream boxes from a truck into the freezer. Patrick attempts to do this, but since he feels cold in there, he turns the heat on, which causes a flood and annoys the manager.Afterwards, the manager tasks Patrick to go into the Goofy Goober mascot costume to entertain the kids. While inside it, Patrick sees that there is unattended ice cream, and decides to suck it all into his costume. The manager finds out about this and tells Patrick if he fails at the job the next day, he will fire him. Patrick comes back home and tells SpongeBob, who was sitting on his rock house, about his day. SpongeBob tells Patrick he will help him out at work so Patrick does not get fired.SpongeBob hides inside of Patrick's uniform and starts working at the place efficiently. The manager is impressed with Patrick and finally gives him a break, allowing him to get the free ice cream he wanted. Patrick wanted to share the ice cream with SpongeBob, but the latter is almost late for the Krusty Krab, so Patrick is all on his own eating. However, Patrick realizes his break is almost over, so he tries to eat all the ice cream he can. However, he eats so much ice cream that he gets a brain freeze, causing the Earth to freeze for five billion years. When it becomes unfrozen, the manager fires Patrick. Since he was lactose intolerant anyways, the episode ends with him walking out the restaurant into a UFO happily.",The Goofy Newbie,"[The episode begins at Goofy Goober's Ice Cream Party Boat. Children are having a good time eating ice cream and playing with the Goofy Goober mascot. But there are some of them who are not having a good time. An angry long line of children are waiting impatiently as Patrick is hogging up all of the ice cream samples at the counter. He takes a sample and eats it.]
Squidina: [slowly losing her patience] Hey you've sampled every flavor we have, will you please just pick one?!
Patrick: Mm-mmm! Not so fast. I would now like to sample combinations of flavors, and I would like you to use my spoon! [holds out a shovel]
Squidina: [pushes shovel away and calls security] Security, we have a sample mooch at the counter.
[The man in the Goofy Goober suit rushes over to the counter. He rips it off, revealing himself to be a security guard. He scoops Patrick up with an ice cream scooper and throws him out. Patrick whimpers sadly before two employees come out, sit on him, and eat ice cream together.]
Octavius Rex's coworker: Wow. I can't believe Goofy Goobers employees get to eat all the ice cream they want on this job.
Patrick: Hmm?
Octavius Rex: Yeah, but the rule is only on the first break. And for lunch, [eats some ice cream] and on the second break, and for dinner. [eats some more ice cream]
Octavius Rex's coworker: Wow! Ice cream all day! [gobbles down some more ice cream]
Octavius Rex: [voiceover as the words ""all day"" appear in Patrick's eyes] Ice cream all day. All day. All day. All day.
Patrick: Ice cream all day? [the two employees look at Patrick and run off, screaming] I'm getting a job at Goofy Goober!
[The next few scenes is a tutorial video for beginners who want to work at Goofy Goober's.]
Video announcer: Goofy Goober's and you.
Training announcer: Hello, and welcome! As a new Goofy Goober employee, we'd like you to know that we appreciate you. [the screen shows Bikini Bottom in the 1800s] The story of our ice cream begins with our founder, Reginald Goober. [a picture of Reginald Goober is shown] Who for some unexplained reason was nicknamed Goofy. [the screen shows Reginald Goober and his ice cream wagon] In 1842, he headed West in a covered ice cream wagon. In the days before cones and refrigeration, [the screen shows ice cream being served on sticks and rocks] he served warm ice cream on rocks and sticks. [the screen shows Goofy Goober's as of now] From those humble beginnings, Goofy Goober has grown into a multibillion dollar business [the screen shows the Goofy Goober's outfit] that you, our newest employee, now have the privilege to work for. [the screen shows an employee washing his hands and spraying perfume in his mouth] We only ask that you, one, practice good hygiene, [the screen shows an employee wiping the table] two, maintain good work habits, [the screen shows a banana split UFO flying around] and three, believe in extraterrestrials.
Reginald Goober: [enters the UFO] Peace, hugs, and ice cream! [flies away in the UFO]
Video announcer: [laughs] The end.
[The screen turns to static and pans out, revealing that Patrick slept through the whole tutorial video. The Goofy Goober's manager turns off the television.]
Goofy Goober manager: Hello, Goofy newbie.
Patrick: [yelps as he suddenly wakes up] Can I have my ice cream now?
Goofy Goober manager: Not until your first break. [chuckles] I'm your manager and I want you to know that I appreciate you. Now let's get you started. [leads Patrick to the sink] You will be washing dishes today. [gives Patrick dishwashing detergent] What do you think of that?
Patrick: Oh, I had a thought once. [his head fuzzes]
Goofy Goober manager: [chuckles] Ooh, you sure put the Goofy in Goober! I'll check on you in a few minutes. [leaves]
[Patrick picks up a dirty bowl and sniffs it. He then gets an idea. The screen shows the time card, ""a few minutes later..."" The Goofy Goober comes back in and sees all of the dishes done. Patrick is playing with the dishwashing detergent.]
Goofy Goober manager: Exceptional! Show me how you cleaned all these dishes so fast.
Patrick: Okay! [takes a bowl, puts it in his mouth and swooshes around; then he takes it out again]
[The manager is shocked at what Patrick did and his eyes become bloodshot.]
Goofy Goober manager: [takes the bowl] Never tell anyone you did that.
Patrick: [spits out a spoon] Is it time for my first break?
Goofy Goober manager: Not yet.
Patrick: Aww! [squeezes the dishwashing detergent bottle]
[Bubble transition to Patrick and the Goofy Goober manager near the freezer.]
Goofy Goober manager: This should be easy. [clears throat as Patrick shivers] Just unload the boxes of ice cream from the truck, and stack them in the freezer. Okay, repeat it back to me.
Patrick: [shakily] When the bell rings, I peel a banana and run like the devil.
Goofy Goober manager: [confused] Uh. Eh, close enough. [leaves]
[The screen shows the time card, ""one hour later..."" Patrick is standing outside the freezer, but the thermostat is turn up way too high, melting all the ice cream inside.]
Goofy Goober manager: [comes back] Ooh, good, good! The truck is empty. [touches the door knob but it burns his hand; he yelps in pain] That's hot! [takes out a towel, opens the door and melted ice cream flows out, flooding the entire ice cream parlor.]
[Patrick is seen fishing on a raft, pulling off a reference to Tom Sawyer.]
Patrick: Nothing's biting today.
Goofy Goober manager: Newbie, why would you turn the heat on in the freezer?
Patrick: Oh, it was freezing in there, and the fire I built wasn't doing it.
Goofy Goober manager: What?! [sinks into the melted ice cream]
[Bubble transition to Patrick being dressed in a Goofy Goober suit.]
Goofy Goober manager: Now, this should be easy for you. You just walk around as Goofy the Goober and wave to the kids. But a warning—Sometimes the kids get a little over-affectionate.
[A little girl is hugging Patrick's leg. Patrick quivers in fear.]
Little girl #1: I love you, Goofy Goober!
Goofy Goober manager: [laughs] So cute. Good luck! [leaves]
Little boy: [jumps on Patrick's suit] I want you to be my daddy!
Little girl #2: [jumps on Patrick's suit with a nutcracker] I want to crack this nut! [squeezes Patrick's suit with the nutcracker]
[Patrick shakes the little girl with the nutcracker off. The little girl is sent flying into a carton of ice cream.]
Patrick: Sorry.
[The little girl comes out with a big blob of ice cream and happily runs around. The other kids join her as they follow her and run around. Patrick notices that their ice cream is unguarded.]
Patrick: Oh. Unattended ice cream. [opens his suit and sucks up some ice cream with the vacuum] Mustn't let it go to waste.
[Patrick sucks up all of the ice cream from the bowls. The manager shows up and is not impressed with Patrick's behavior. He turns the vacuum off. He opens Patrick's suit and sees tons of ice cream in it. He takes out some ice cream from Patrick's mouth.]
Goofy Goober manager: I think you better go home and clean up.
Patrick: [whinny] But I haven't had my first ice cream break!
Goofy Goober manager: I'll give you another chance tomorrow. If it doesn't work out, I'm afraid you're fired... [clears throat] in a most appreciative way.
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob sitting on Patrick's rock, playing the theme song ending on his nose like a flute. Just then, Patrick comes by and feels very depressed.]
Patrick: [Stupidly not recognizing SpongeBob and tries to walk away] Oh, sorry, mister. I thought this was my rock.
SpongeBob: [slides down and laughs] Patrick, this is your rock. I was waiting for you. How was your first day at work?
Patrick: Oh, I can't do anything right. I'll probably get fired tomorrow.
SpongeBob: Oh, you poor little sea star. Tell you what, buddy—Tomorrow, I'll come with you to work and help out.
Patrick: [Stupidly] Oh, thanks, kind stranger!
[Bubble transition to back at Goofy Goober's the following day.]
Patrick: Okay, tell me for the gajillionth time, how is this gonna work?
SpongeBob: I'll show you. [climbs into Patrick's uniform] If you put your arms behind you, I can be your hands.
Patrick: Ooh, so when I scoop ice cream—
SpongeBob: I'll do the scoopin'.
Patrick: And when I give change—
SpongeBob: [throws out money] I'll do the countin'.
Patrick: And when my butt itches—
SpongeBob: Yeah, I'm not doing that.
[Bubble transition to inside Goofy Goober's.]
Goofy Goober manager: Okay, ready for your second, and last chance? [gets a bit suspicious as he nearly notices SpongeBob in Patrick's uniform; but chuckles] Let me show you how to make—
Patrick: Ice cream sandwiches? [SpongeBob's arms wave out of his uniform] I think I got this.
[SpongeBob makes a tower of ice cream sandwiches and puts a flag on top. A little eskimo comes out of the ice cream sandwich tower.]
Patrick: Time for my first break?
Goofy Goober manager: Oh, no, no, no. Not yet, not yet. [chuckles] But I think you're ready for the big time. [cuts to Patrick at the counter] All right, kid. Relax, don't choke, and try to have fun. [leaves]
Patrick: Easy, queasy, lemon squeezy.
[SpongeBob makes a perfect banana split.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da! [puts a cherry on top]
Patrick: Work is hard work. [falls asleep]
[SpongeBob makes random ice cream dishes for the children. He makes a sundae with a graham cracker windmill, impressing the children. Then he puts sprinkles on them. Then he juggles some of the ice cream toppings and ingredients. Then he takes a blob of vanilla ice cream and morphs it into a puppet.]
SpongeBob: [plays with the ice cream puppet] Hello, folks! I'm Edible Edie! Start with my head!
[The children laugh and cheer at SpongeBob's outstanding performances. SpongeBob drives out of the counter in an ice cream boatmobile.]
Goofy Goober manager: [laughs] Great job, newbie. Now you can take your first break.
Patrick: My break? I can eat ice cream now?
Goofy Goober manager: All you can handle.
[Patrick drives out of Goofy Goobers in the ice cream boatmobile. He abruptly stops it outside, causing SpongeBob and Patrick to fall out and land on the ground.]
Patrick: Thanks for your help, buddy. Now, let's dig in.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'd love to. [his watch beeps] But if I don't hurry, I'll be late for my job. Sure you can handle that ice cream all... [pauses] by yourself? [sees Patrick eating the entire ice cream boatmobile] Silly question. [Patrick eats an ice cream sandwich and burps] Good luck, my employed pal. [leaves for the Krusty Krab]
Patrick: [looks at his drawn watch] Oh! Only two more minutes for my break! And two more minutes for ice cream!
[Patrick reenters Goofy Goober's and eats all the ice cream at the counter. Then he eats the soft served ice cream from the ice cream machine.]
Kids: [chanting] Chug, chug, chug, chug!
[Patrick is all chubby and fat from eating all that soft serve ice cream. Then he hops around, knocking over some bowls and ice cream cups. He lands in the center of Goofy Goober, takes a deep breath and sucks up all the ice cream. But something happens. After eating all that ice cream, his body begins to shiver.]
Patrick: Brain freeze!
[Patrick's body becomes covered in ice and the ice freezes up Goofy Goober's, Bikini Bottom, Bikini Atoll, and the entire world.]
French narrator: (Robotic speak) Five billion years later...
[After five billion years into the future, everything is thawed out.]
Patrick: [sees himself thawed out] I think that went well!
Goofy Goober manager: [gets real angry and breaks out of the ice] You are fired! [breathes heavily as children happily run past him]
Patrick: That's okay! I'm lactose intolerant anyways. [chuckles] A little— [exits Goofy Goober's and climbs into a banana split UFO just like Reginald Goober did] Peace, hugs, and ice cream! [flies off in the UFO as the episode ends]",1.28,Kaz

Mr. Krabs: According to the nice man from the Labor Authority, it's time for your break, boy-o.
SpongeBob: [confused] We get breaks?

Mr. Krabs is managing everything smoothly, while barking orders at SpongeBob and Squidward. Mr. Krabs helps out the customers with their problems, whether it be refilling a man's drink, giving another customer ketchup, or a slicing a Krabby Patty into small pieces for a little baby to eat. Mr. Krabs also manages to fight off a group of pirates at the same time all of this is happening. After all of that, Mr. Krabs' claw smells cash, and finds a penny on the floor. Mr. Krabs delightfully claims the penny, but almost immediately afterwards, SpongeBob kicks open the kitchen door, accidentally knocking Mr. Krabs all over the restaurant until he eventually lands in the middle of the street. A construction worker hoisting up a piano becomes distracted when he notices the penny that Mr. Krabs found earlier fell out of his pocket, causing Mr. Krabs to be crushed by the piano. An ambulance arrives immediately, but before they take Mr. Krabs away, SpongeBob asks who will be in charge of the Krusty Krab while he is out. Mr. Krabs is about to point at Squidward, but he puts SpongeBob in front of him, officially making SpongeBob the boss of the Krusty Krab until Mr. Krabs recovers, much to Mr. Krabs' dismay. Squidward mocks SpongeBob, saying that he will probably ruin everything ""like he always does."" SpongeBob decides that if he wants to boss like Mr. Krabs, he will have to act like him too.Later on, a nurse is wheeling Mr. Krabs, who is in a full body cast, back to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob greets him at the front door, and wheels him inside of the restaurant to show him how he has been taking care of things. He reveals that he hired Patrick to be the new fry cook of the Krusty Krab, since he is too busy being the boss now, much to Mr. Krabs' distress. SpongeBob shows Mr. Krabs how much of an effective boss he is by helping two troubled customers; one of which needs a napkin, and the other having a wobbly table. Nearby, Squidward yells at a customer, which results in SpongeBob scolding him. SpongeBob makes Squidward wear a helmet that forces him to smile to appear more friendly to the customer, but it only creeps him out instead. Squidward is about to blow up at SpongeBob, but they suddenly hear a slicing sound coming from the kitchen, and SpongeBob goes to check it out. It is Patrick, attempting to clean the deli-slicer with a pair of tongs. SpongeBob offers to take care of the situation, while Patrick gets back to work. In the next scene, Patrick is trying to make a Krabby Patty, but SpongeBob micromanages everything he does, even down to the tiniest detail. This annoys Patrick to the point where he quits, but not before taking off all of his clothes. Patrick slams the door on his way out, and SpongeBob gets caught in the spinning door, resulting in a part of himself being sliced off. SpongeBob ends up leaving the SpongeBob slice clone in charge of the cooking. Out in the dining room, Squidward is being pestered by an angry mob. This prompts him to storm out of the restaurant, but not before SpongeBob attempts to stop him. It does not work however, as Squidward screams in SpongeBob's face that he quits for good, angrily leaving the Krusty Krab.The angry mob turns to SpongeBob, but he quickly thinks of the solution to slice off another clone of himself and put him in charge of the cash register. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that everything is now under control, but out of nowhere, tons of things start going wrong at once. One woman spills her drink, another man slips in the spill and falls, one customer complains that the TV does not work, one customer complains that it is too hot, and another customer complains that it is too cold. The pressure eventually gets to SpongeBob, as he screams at the tops of his lungs for everyone to stop. SpongeBob runs back into the kitchen and starts slicing off multiple clones of himself, all of which assist each and every customer with their problems. Suddenly, Patrick (who is still naked) bursts through the front door, saying that he is just ""cleaning out his desk"" (although in actuality, he just steals a family's meal). Patrick leaves the door open though, resulting in the SpongeBob slice clones being blown around the restaurant and eventually being sliced to bits via the Krusty Krab's ceiling fan. All of the customers are grossed out by the sponge bits and leave the establishment, making Mr. Krabs furious to the point where he breaks out of his body cast. SpongeBob (who is now stuck in the ceiling fan) apologizes to Mr. Krabs for messing everything up and explains that he wanted to be like him. Mr. Krabs forgives him, saying that the rage he felt watching him destroy his restaurant forced his body to heal very quickly, but also states that SpongeBob's pay will have to be docked for decades to cover all the damage SpongeBob caused. Mr. Krabs turns on the ceiling fan and laughs, while SpongeBob spins around in the ceiling fan, as the episode ends.",Boss for a Day,"[This episode starts at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is trying to sort out some chaos.]
Mr. Krabs: Where's that order for table 3? Table 5 ready to be bust. There's a spill in the bathroom! I need you swabbing the deck, Mr. Squidward! [His eyes act like periscopes and then notices something.] SpongeBob! Table 8 needs more coral fries! Hop to it boy!
SpongeBob: [Gasping] I'm hopping sir.
Incidental 13: My thirst is not yet quenched. [moaning]
Mr. Krabs: Ha, tiyah, here you go, thank you. No free refills. [laughs]
Incidental 42: [grunts] I'm  out of ketchup!
Incidental 93: We need utensils!
Incidental 114: [car horn honks] I ordered this to go!
Mr. Krabs: Yep [showing his claw] takes a pretty steady claw to oversee this ship [his claw barks and smells like a dog] what is it, girl? What do you smell? [Mr. Krabs finds a penny on the floor] Ooh! Find a penny. Pick it up. All day long you'll have a penny! [laughs, then scrubs his claws] What a good girl! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [opens the door directly into Mr. Krabs' butt] Order up!
[Mr. Krabs falls into a customer, breaks the table, smashes things into a pole, knocks down the ""Krusty Krab"" sign, falls in the road, and a penny falls onto the road]
Worker fish: [talks to the camera] Hey, a penny!
[A piano falls into Mr. Krabs, and the ambulance arrives.]
SpongeBob: [he is seen panicking] Somebody call an ambulance! [he stops panicking] Oh, you're here.
[Squidward walks outside]
SpongeBob: Wait, Mr. Krabs. Who's in charge while you're out?
[Mr. Krabs wakes up, he chooses between SpongeBob and Squidward. He's about to point to Squidward, when Squidward holds up SpongeBob, so he's really choosing SpongeBob with his mouth as piano keys]
Mr. Krabs: [His claw is broken] Not SpongeBob.
Incidental 25: Let's go.
Mr, Krabs: No! No!
SpongeBob: Oh, he picked me. I--- [jumps in the air] I'm in charge! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll be the best boss the Krusty Krab ever had. Just like you Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: Ha, you can't do Mr. Krabs' job.
SpongeBob: [cries] I can't?
Squidward: Course not. You're gonna get some annoying idea in your head, act all silly and ruin everything. [starts walking away] Like you always do.
SpongeBob: [thinking] I guess if I want to become a boss like Mr. Krabs... [looks like Mr. Krabs] ...then I'll learn to think like Mr. Krabs. [laughs like Mr. Krabs]
[Bubble transition to Incidental 49 taking Mr. Krabs to the Krusty Krab in a wheelchair]
SpongeBob: [opens the door, and Incidental 49 appears in a slight shock of what SpongeBob did to Krabs] Mr. Krabs, I'm so glad you're back! [smiles and then Mr. Krabs shakes]
SpongeBob: [pushes his wheelchair back up]
Mr. Krabs: Woah!
SpongeBob: Just wait 'til you see what I've done to your restaurant. [pulling the wheelchair and headed to the Krusty Krab and looks around him and his customers]
SpongeBob: Nothing. Is it great? Everything's just how you left it. Whenever we have a problem around here, I ask myself what would Mr. Krabs do.
SpongeBob: [turns Mr. Krabs' wheelchair and makes Mr. Krabs dizzy] And I do that!
SpongeBob: I even hired a new fry cook since I'm too busy being the boss now.
[SpongeBob turned Mr. Krabs' wheelchair to see the new fry cook]
SpongeBob: Just like you would have done.
[Mr. Krabs makes weird angry sounds and Patrick wearing SpongeBob's pants and spatula is in his bellybutton and put it back and he tried to eat a patty]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, I taught him everything I know. [turns Mr. Krabs' wheelchair and makes Mr. Krabs dizzy again]
[Patrick puts the spatula in his mouth and grabs the ketchup. He puts the spatula back in his hand, and the spatula is drooling. He then flips the ketchup with the spatula and puts it on the grill, but the grill is burning, and the ketchup is about to explode. Squidward is reading his book while his shift. Then, his face, part of his book, and one of the windows are covered with ketchup.]
Patrick: Order up!
[Squidward gets very angry]
SpongeBob: You'll have a better view of my managerial magic from over here. [turns Mr. Krabs' wheelchair and makes Mr. Krabs dizzy again]
Incidental 69: I'm out of napkins.
SpongeBob: Ooo, here we go. Watch me work! Your napkins, sir.
Incidental 69: Thank you.
Incidental 23: [the baby is jumping down the table] Hey! This table is too wobbly.
SpongeBob: [duct tape in hand] I'll let the boss take care of that.
[The table is not wobbly and the baby is duct-taped and making weird sounds]
Incidental 42: Hm.
Squidward: [angrily] What do you want ?!??
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, what would Mr. Krabs say? [morphs into Mr. Krabs and talks like him] At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Squidward. We're always polite to our payin' customers.
Squidward: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I please take your order?
SpongeBob: [normal voice] Remember, Squidward. Service with a smile. Here. Try one of Mr. Krabs' vintage training devices. [puts Squidward's head in the training device]
Squidward: [freaky smile] May I please take your order?
Incidental 42: Oh, uh. I'll take a Krabby Patty [chuckles] . Hold the freaky smile.
SpongeBob: I think that went pretty well, don't you?
Squidward: [yells] SpongeBob! You aggravating, obnoxious, loathsome little...
[Squidward and SpongeBob hear a loud noise]
SpongeBob: Oh, hold that constructive criticism, Squidward. I'll be right back.
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: I'm cleaning the deli slicer. I used the tongs like you said.
SpongeBob: [Looks like Mr. Krabs] Ah, Ah, Ah. The tongs are for holding rags, not bricks.
SpongeBob: Let me finish this pal. You get back on the grill.
Patrick: Okeydoke. [gets back on the grill and he throws a brick at the deli slicer, and the brick directly to the window to Mr. Krabs' face and gets dizzy]
[The next scene is Patrick is at his grill]
[Patrick is smashing his spatula]
SpongeBob: Hey, um, Patrick? Could you, er... bump the grill temperature up about half a degree?
Patrick: Fine.
[Patrick is flipping the patties counterclockwise with his spatula]
SpongeBob: [tapping his finger to Patrick] And you should be flipping the patties with the clockwise wrist motion because [looking like Mr. Krabs] the customer can always taste the difference.
Patrick: Whatever you say, boss. Oh, dirty.
[Patrick is smashing the patties with his spatula and puts the Krabby Patty in the wrong order]
SpongeBob: [gasps] No, Patrick! We went over this! It goes bun, patty, cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, bun, not bun, patty, cheese, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, bun.
Patrick: That's it! This was supposed to be fun, but now it's...er... the other thing! I quit! [he eats his Krabby Patty, and before he walks out, he rips his pants and throws his pants]
Patrick: These too!
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, you are my best friend-mployee.
SpongeBob: [walking to the door and spins vertically and his eyes, nose, and mouth disappear] Whoa!
SpongeBob: [falls down to the ground and the second SpongeBob's eyes, nose, mouth, and pants appeared] Spoink!
SpongeBob: Wow! Aren't you a real slice off the ol' block?
SpongeBob: [grabs his spatula, and the other SpongeBob is surprised] Can you work the grill?
SpongeBob: [grabs his spatula and takeover his job, and laughs] Mm-hmm. Ha! You're hired! [grabs his spatula and points to his body and walking to the door]
SpongeBob: [his face blows up and down] Ah...
[The angry mob talks angrily to Squidward]
Squidward: [walking out the Krusty Krab with an angry face]
SpongeBob: [morphs into Mr. Krabs and talks like him] Mr. Squidward, it's not time for your break.
Squidward: I'm taking a permanent break, from you ! [smashes SpongeBob with his head] I quuuuit! [slams his hat at SpongeBob while breaking the floor. He walks out the Krusty Krab with an angry face]
SpongeBob: [morphs back to his normal self] No! [angry mob walking to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Uh, oh. I need more employees.
SpongeBob: [pointing his finger] Ooh... Uh, just a second, everybody! [makes a paper airplane out of one of his copies and throws it at the cashier]
SpongeBob: How can I help you?
[The customers come and order something]
SpongeBob: Woo! Everything is under control now, Mr. K.
SpongeBob: I guarantee it.
Incidental 45: Oh, dear. Oops, I spilled...
Incidental 60: Whoa! [trips and falls]
Incidental 60: [water on his head and Krabby Patty on his legs] Oops, I fell down.
SpongeBob: No!
Incidental 64: [pointing to the TV] Hey! How come the TV don't work?
SpongeBob: Oh, no!
Incidental 40: [waving his hand like a fan and he's sweating] It's too hot in here..
[SpongeBob starts worrying]
Incidental 41: [freezing] It's too cold in here.
SpongeBob: [looking around] What do I do? What do I do?
Mr. Krabs: [feels angry and going up and down]
SpongeBob: [waving his hands and screaming] Everybody stop!
SpongeBob: [goes into the kitchen, slices himself with a shovel thrice, puts himself thrice in a drawer and goes to the deli slicer, blows his hands, and goes into the deli slicer, copying himself eleven times, helps the customers, and tries to make Mr. Krabs dizzy]
Patrick: Don't mind me. I'm just here to clean out my desk. [cleaning out and walking out in the nude]
SpongeBob: [dancing and then blowing copies of SpongeBob] No! My slices!
Incidental 60: [water on his head and Krabby Patty on his legs again.]
SpongeBob: Stop, please! You're ruining the Krusty Krab dining experience.
SpongeBob: [his copies then hit the fan. The copies get shredded, fall on the floor and the customers get hit as well and then the customers run out of the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [makes weird angry sounds again, and this makes his bandage suit unwrap and the shredded copies of SpongeBob go away]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Mr. Krabs! You're all better! [SpongeBob's body gets revealed] Sorry I let you down. [pleads] All I wanted was to be a good boss. Just like you.
Mr. Krabs: Oh well, there is no need to get your sails in a twist about it boy. Nobody's just like me, especially you. Besides, you saved me months in that there body cast. If it weren't for the rage I felt watching you destroy me restaurant, I woulda never forced me body to heal so quickly!
SpongeBob: Oh, so in a way, I’ve done good, huh?
Mr. Krabs: Oh no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not even close. You were the worst boss ever! I’m gonna have to dock your pay for decades, just to cover all the damage you caused! [laughs and turns on fan as he walks away]

Plankton comes and tries to arm wrestle with Mr. Krabs. Plankton almost wins, but it turns out Mr. Krabs was just playing with him and wins with ease. After Plankton gets humiliated, he goes back to the Chum Bucket. He gets the idea to use the Chum Bucket glove to win the fight, so he brings it to life using electricity and goes back to Mr. Krabs for a rematch. Mr. Krabs scoffs at this, but Plankton then shows the glove, who defeats Krabs very easily. The glove dumps everyone there inside a hole and Plankton leaves while riding the glove.Plankton goes to the Krusty Krab so he can steal the formula, but the glove decides to stop following Plankton's orders and puts him in hot sauce, severely hurting him. After the glove leaves, Plankton opens up the security box at the restaurant, which turns out to have SpongeBob inside as he sometimes guards it during the night. He decides to help Plankton with his issue after hearing about it, and the two go into town to defeat the glove. Plankton first tries to shoot rockets at it, but ends up exploding himself instead of the glove.SpongeBob tells him he can only defeat it with love, so they go inside a white glove to trick the Chum Bucket glove into falling in love with it. It almost works, but while eating spaghetti, the glove accidentally slurps the other glove, revealing SpongeBob and Plankton to have been inside the entire time. This causes the glove to get angry due to losing his love.Later, SpongeBob is crying near his home due to failing to help Plankton. When Plankton tells SpongeBob to ""keep his pants on,"" this gives SpongeBob the idea to bring Hans with them to help them defeat the glove. After Hans is introduced, he gets the idea that the glove is at Glove World!, which turns out to be true, as it is terrorizing the fish at the amusement park. Hans decides to put up a fight with the glove, but since he is unable to defeat the glove on his own, he asks SpongeBob and Plankton to create a distraction.The two come up with the plan to insult the glove to get its attention. When Plankton uses SpongeBob as a bullhorn to say the insult, Hans uses the distraction as a way to put the glove on him. Back at the Chum Bucket, the glove is replaced by a combat boot, which Plankton considers better than a glove. However, it falls through the Chum Bucket and crushes Plankton as the episode ends.",Handemonium,"[The episode starts off in Larry's Gym at night; the lights turn off, as Frank, the Muscular Goldfish, goes into the arm wrestling ring. The scene then cuts to Mr. Krabs arm-wrestling with a muscular fish.]
Announcer: [from off-screen] Welcome, everyone, to the Secret Anchor Arm-Wrestling Club!
Champ 1: Yeah! [chest muscles flex]
[Both Mr. Krabs and his opponent are seen struggling to beat each other, groaning.]
Tough Green Fish: Give it up, old man! You're nothing but a softshell, Krabs!
[They are still struggling to beat each other until Mr. Krabs pinches his opponent's hand with his claw. His opponent screams in pain and crashes into the table. The spectators cheer for Mr. Krabs as he smiles smugly.]
Beefy guy: Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: I win — again! [laughs] That's me penny-pinching hand. [holds a penny in his claw and laughs]
[The Popeye fish and another tough fish walks in and carries Mr. Krabs' opponent out. Another fish brings in a new table.]
Mr. Krabs: This old soft-shell... is ready to twist another wrist! Who's next? [eyes stretch out to Reg, who declines, and to another tough fish]
Plankton: [from behind the spectators] I am! [spectators gasp]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [spectators step aside to reveal Plankton]
Plankton: You got a problem with that, Eu-gene? [to the spectators] His name's Eugene, by the way!
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] I got no problem with that, Shel-don. [to the spectators] His name's Sheldon, by the way.
[The Popeye fish and his partner bring in a smaller table and places it on top of the main table. The spectators cheer as Mr. Krabs and Plankton grasp each other's arms. The bell is rang by Larry the Lobster and the fight begins.]
Plankton: It's humiliation time, Krab-cake! I've been working out for months to bring you down! [muscles appear throughout his body]
Mr. Krabs: [struggling] What's — going on here? I can't... hold it —
Plankton: Any last words?

Plankton: Oh, why do I try to compete with Krabs? He always goes long and I always fall short! Will I ever get the upper hand?
[A scallop poops on Plankton causing him to look up. The scallop lands on the glove on top of the Chum Bucket.]
Plankton: That's it! My glove! My big, beautiful, bone-crushing glove! Thank you, clam!
[Bubble transition to Plankton seen working on the glove on top of the Chum Bucket as a thunderstorm brews in Bikini Bottom. Lightning strikes the glove and Plankton is blasted away; suddenly the glove gains life and starts to move.]
Plankton: The pinky is wiggling... wiggling! [laughs maniacally; the glove lets go of the Chum Bucket handle and jumps in front of Plankton] Let's see Krabs throw down this gauntlet! [boards the glove and rides it like a horse towards Larry's gym] Hi-ya!
[The scene cuts to Larry's Gym, where Mr. Krabs arm-wrestles and defeats other tough fish like Reg and the Popeye fish. Plankton hops onto the table, in front of Mr. Krabs.]
Plankton: I want a rematch, Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [dismisses Plankton] Boring. [shrugs] But whatevs.
Plankton: [pretends to be in pain, clutching his hand] Oh no, not a hand cramp! Not now! [smugly] Luckily I have a last-minute substitution, standing by. [takes a deep breath and blows a whistle]
[The ground rumbles and the Chum Bucket glove punches a hole into Larry's Gym. The glove then flicks the tough fish away with his fingers and makes its way to the wrestling table, about to wrestle with Mr. Krabs. Scene cuts to Larry the Lobster holding the mallet to ring the bell, but he faints onto the bell causing it to ring. The match between Mr. Krabs and the glove begins, and he struggles to defeat the glove.]
Mr. Krabs: [groaning in pain] Eeeh – oh, oh – oh — [Plankton is seen with an evil grin on his face, while Mr. Krabs continues to struggle] Any... last... words?
Plankton: [blows the whistle and the glove hoists Mr. Krabs up in the air] Just one... Sucker! [laughs maniacally while Mr. Krabs trembles in fear]
[The glove spins Mr. Krabs in the air and whacks him on the floor, causing a hole to form.]
Mr. Krabs: [regains consciousness] Huh –? [shadow forms above him] No, no, no, no, no, no —
[The other tough fish fall above Mr. Krabs as the glove gathers them all into the hole on the floor. Plankton hops on top of the glove.]
Plankton: [raises arms in victory] Ta-daah! Let's give a big hand to the new champion! [applauds; then takes a deep breath and blows the whistle] Okay, move it, filthy fingers! [rides glove like a horse straight to the Krusty Krab] Aww, too bad Krabs isn't here to catch me with my glove in the cookie jar, heheh... Bust the door! [glove punches a hole into the Krusty Krab, flicking away the chairs and tables] Bust this one, too! [glove flicks the door of Mr. Krabs' office and goes in, creating a hole; the safe containing the secret formula is then seen] And now, for the secret formula! Open, says me! [hits glove with a whip but he is blasted off of the glove; the glove then growls at him and he hits the glove with the whip one more time] Go and hand me that, I command you! [glove takes whip from Plankton and he trembles in fear] Please don't hurt me! [glove flicks the whip away] Whew!
[The glove punches a hole into the kitchen and brings Plankton along. Plankton is then dipped into a container of hot sauce; afterwards, the container sizzles and Plankton is blasted off of the container onto the floor. Plankton screams in pain, slaps himself multiple times, afterwards, his antennae fizzles off and he rockets towards the sky as a firework. He falls back down into the Krusty Krab kitchen, screaming then groaning in pain.]
Fish #1: [from off-screen] Look out!
[Someone screams, and the glove is then seen leaving the Krusty Krab, flicking random Bikini Bottomites and their vehicles away, with two citizens landing on the Krusty Krab window. A boatmobile lands into the Krusty Krab, and Plankton hides himself after taking a peek at the commotion.]
Plankton: Uh-oh. That glove is gonna destroy Bikini Bottom and I'm gonna get blamed for it! [panics] I hate prison food! But I can't stop that monster all by myself... This is an emergency! [slips onto a puddle and becomes dizzy; his vision gradually clears itself and he sees an emergency box on the kitchen wall] Emergency box... That's convenient! [goes to the emergency box and opens it, revealing SpongeBob inside]
SpongeBob: [laughs; jumps off of the box and gives Plankton a salute] What is your emergency, Sir? [sees Plankton] Oh, hi, Plankton.
Plankton: I need a hand with something, kid. [takes SpongeBob with him, by the hand] Now do it!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Sir... No matter what the emergency, I've seen it all before.
[Bubble transition to the glove holding a boatmobile and controlling it, making it crash onto a Bikini Bottomite's boatmobile. The Bikini Bottomite runs away, screaming, and the glove throws the automobile it's holding onto the abandoned boatmobile. Plankton and SpongeBob are then seen watching the glove from a distance.]
SpongeBob: [screaming] I've never seen that before! [a burning automobile flies past and SpongeBob avoids it; the glove heard growling in the background]
Plankton: Usually it's sitting quietly on top of the Chum Bucket.
SpongeBob: Well, maybe we can talk to it.
Plankton: Talk is cheap! [whips out a stand with a button on top of it] Which leads you to push this button when I say so.
[SpongeBob, looking very excited, tries to push the button but Plankton slaps his hand away. Plankton is then seen boarding a tank loaded with missiles. Plankton aims it at the glove, who is seen crushing a boatmobile.]
Plankton: [shouting] Hey, Fistface! Prepare for annihilation! [to SpongeBob] Push the button, SpongeBob! [laughs maniacally, then pauses] Huh?
SpongeBob: [covering his eyes] Oh, I can't do it, I can't shoot the glove! [hides in his pants and points at the glove] It's – it's wiggling...
[The glove is seen grabbing a bus and squirting its passengers out. The passengers scream and run away as the glove throws the bus away.]
Plankton: [reaches for the button as his missiles point towards the sky] I must push it! [pushes the button and laughs maniacally as the missiles are launched towards the sky] What? [the missiles head down to the ground and hits Plankton and SpongeBob, causing an explosion; Plankton is then seen running on the tank's wheel like a treadmill, with his antennae burning] Why are you here again?
SpongeBob: I'm helping. [laughs; picks Plankton up] Listen to me, Plankton. You can't fight a big monster like that with hate . You can only defeat them with love . [tries to kiss Plankton but is slapped away]
Plankton: [groans in disgust] Love? That's too brutal... Let's do it! [SpongeBob's eyes turn into hearts and accidentally crushes Plankton with his hand]
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Plankton trying to fit into a giant glove.]
SpongeBob: [laughing weirdly from inside the disguise] Disguise!
Plankton: Pipe down, SpongeBob, or you'll blow our glover... I mean, cover!
[SpongeBob gives Plankton a thumbs-up, then proceeds to spray their disguise with perfume. They then head towards the Chum Bucket glove, seen continuously destroying property in downtown Bikini Bottom, and it then throws a boatmobile away, causing it to explode. SpongeBob and Plankton's glove walks by, giggling like a lady, and it catches the Chum Bucket glove's attention. The Chum Bucket glove catches up with SpongeBob and Plankton's glove, and dances with it. The two gloves then form a heart and little hearts show up around them.]
Plankton: [from inside the disguise] It's working, SpongeBob! He's in love! He's a big dope.
SpongeBob: [giggling] Love...
[The Chum Bucket glove spins SpongeBob and Plankton's glove and leaves it behind. It comes back, bringing a dinner table with candlelights. It then proceeds to get some chairs so they can both sit down, as if on a date. The Chum Bucket glove tries to hold the pinky finger of SpongeBob and Plankton's glove, but gets slapped away. Afterwards, it tries to slurp a spaghetti noodle, then SpongeBob and Plankton's glove does it as well. The Chum Bucket glove slurped a bit too much and it slurped SpongeBob and Plankton's glove off, causing SpongeBob and Plankton to accidentally reveal themselves. The Chum Bucket glove groans in shock.]
Plankton: [calling out] Check, please.
[The Chum Bucket glove groans in anger, smashing the dinner table while SpongeBob and Plankton run away. Afterwards, it groans in sadness after finding SpongeBob and Plankton's discarded giant glove. Bubble transition to the next day at SpongeBob's front yard, with SpongeBob sitting down and Plankton pacing back and forth.]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Plankton. You came to me for help... and I failed! [cries and drowns Plankton in tears]
Plankton: [accidentally swallowing SpongeBob's tears and spits it out] It's alright, kid. [squeezes water off his antennae] Keep your pants on.
SpongeBob: [stops crying] Eh? Keep my pants on? [stands up and spins his pants around] Keep my pants on! That's a great idea! Eee-oop! [puts his pants down]
Plankton: Are you insane? [looks away] I said, keep them on!
SpongeBob: [walks towards his front door] Don't worry, you'll see. [clears throat and sings his theme song] ♪ Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? ♪
Hans: [shows up and puts pants back on SpongeBob] You do.
[Plankton looks at Hans in shock, then screams.]
SpongeBob: Thanks for the pants, Hans, but... could you help me with another problem?
Hans: [manipulates hand like a puppet and pokes SpongeBob] I'm always here to help you, SpongeBob. [holds out his hand] High-five!
SpongeBob: [morphs into a hand and jumps to meet Hans' hand] High-five! [falls down and accidentally crushes Plankton]
Plankton: Ouch! [pops out of one of SpongeBob's holes] I get it. To catch a huge glove, you need a huge hand!
Hans: [gives a thumbs-up] Oooh, ja!
Plankton: [squeezes himself out of the hole] You're a genius, SquarePants!
SpongeBob: But that old glove could be anywhere by now. How are we going to find him?
Plankton: Hmm, let's see... if I was a glove, where would I go?
Hans: [raises hand enthusiastically] Ooh, ooh, ooh... I know!
[Bubble transition to Glove World, where Harold and his son are ogling at a Glove World toy stand, with an employee looking very bored.]
Timmy: [pointing somewhere] Daddy, I want it!
Harold: Now, Timmy, you already have one of those glove toys at home.
Timmy: [pointing at the glove toys] Not that one... [points to something off-screen] That one!
[Harold screams, and the Chum Bucket glove is then seen destroying property within Glove World, throwing a mini Ferris wheel away. It stops in front of a mini merry-go-round filled with children.]
Kid Fish: Uh-oh.
[The Chum Bucket glove spins the mini merry-go-round, blasting the children away. The Glove World visitors scream and run away, and the glove flicks some of them off of his path.]
Hans: [from off-screen] Hey, Glove-zilla! [camera pans over to him, with SpongeBob and Plankton, and points at the Chum Bucket glove] Someone needs to teach you some Swedish manners! [clenches into a fist as a kid screams and runs away, then prepares to charge like a bull]
SpongeBob and Plankton: [points at the Chum Bucket glove off-screen] Sick 'em, Hans!
[Hans charges like a bull towards the Chum Bucket glove and pokes it, blasting SpongeBob and Plankton off onto a concessionaire stand. Afterwards, he picks out a mascot-wearing Glove World employee and flicks him away.]
Hans: I challenge you to a duel!
[Hans wrestles with the Chum Bucket glove. SpongeBob and Plankton are seen watching Hans wrestle the Chum Bucket glove.]
Plankton: Give him the old butt-kicking discount, Hans!
SpongeBob: But only love will defeat the glove!
[Hans continues to wrestle with the Chum Bucket glove. Hans pinches the Chum Bucket glove, while one of its fingers punch Hans away.]
SpongeBob: Oh, look, they're playing rock-paper-scissors! [Hans and the Chum Bucket glove play rock-paper-scissors while SpongeBob counts, off-screen] One, two, three! [Hans uses scissors]
Plankton: Yeah! Nothing beats scissors... [chuckles]
[The Chum Bucket glove uses rock and is hovering over Hans.]
SpongeBob: Oh, except rock...
Hans: Uh-oh.
[The Chum Bucket glove crushes Hans as SpongeBob and Plankton groan in pain. The Chum Bucket glove then proceeds to have a thumb war with Hans.]
SpongeBob: Oh my goodness, it's a thumb war!
[Hans continues to have a thumb war with the glove, which overpowers him and throws him onto a nearby ice cream stand, crushing it with their weight. They roll on the ground, towards SpongeBob and Plankton, who attempt to run away but end up being onboard Hans. The glove hurls them towards a bigger merry-go-round, and they all spin around as the glove continues its thumb war with Hans. They are all hurled off the merry-go-round, and the glove holds Hans down with its thumb. Hans is stuck under the glove's grasp.]
Hans: I can't beat the glove, SpongeBob. It's too strong. You need to create a diversion.
SpongeBob: Diversion, eh?
[SpongeBob thinks of a diversion, and Plankton does the same, pacing back and forth.]
Plankton: Oh... Aha! [pauses] No...
[The scene alternates between SpongeBob and Plankton, who are both thinking. They suddenly get off of Hans.]
Plankton: We need a bullhorn, stat!
SpongeBob: [morphs nose into a bullhorn] I am a bullhorn, stat!
Plankton: [hops on SpongeBob and speaks into one of the holes; his voice amplified by bullhorn] Hey, finger-face! Your grandma was a combat boot! [laughs]
[The Chum Bucket glove stops its thumb war with Hans and heads towards SpongeBob and Plankton, who both shiver in fear. The glove hovers over both of them and is about to attack, but Hans wears the glove.]
Hans: I got him! [poses] How do I look?
[The glove struggles to get off of Hans but is intercepted.]
SpongeBob: [admiringly] Aww, they fit each other just like a glove. [laughs]
Plankton: [imitates SpongeBob's laugh] Hardy-har-har.
Hans: He's harmless now, SpongeBob. See you tomorrow morning, I'll bring the pants! [leaves]
Plankton: [laughs, then realizes Hans left with his Chum Bucket glove] Wha–? Hey, come back! That glove is irreplaceable! Or is it?
[Bubble transition back to the Chum Bucket, whose glove is now replaced by a boot.]
Plankton: That looks way better than a glove! And it's a combat boot... to boot. [goes inside the Chum Bucket while singing to himself; then combat boot falls down] Ouch!

SpongeBob is against this, because he is friends with the animals, so the zookeeper puts an ankle alarm on him to prevent him from going into the animal enclosures, which will go off should he do it again. SpongeBob tries to evade this by keeping the foot with the ankle alarm outside the enclosures, but this fails and he gets kicked out of the zoo, with Patrick sneaking into a sea monkey enclosure so he gets kicked out with him.SpongeBob is crying on Patrick's rock, until he gets the idea of building a bubble zoo after creating a snot bubble. They create many bubble animals as well as the zoo itself using Extra Strength Bubble Soap. The zoo is visited by many people and it is a success.Meanwhile, Squidward wakes up from his nap and goes outside, only to get trapped inside one of the bubble animals. After he is released, one of the bubble animals eats his clothes, causing Squidward to panic and pop the entire bubble zoo. The bubble animals get angry at SpongeBob and at the same time, invade the Krusty Krab and the Chum Bucket.While SpongeBob and Patrick are cornered by the bubble animals, the former calls the animals from the real zoo to defeat the bubble animals. The animals come and the bubble animals get scared by the sea monster, causing them to hide in the Extra Strength Bubble Soap canister. The episode ends with the zoo manager letting SpongeBob back in the zoo for bringing back his animals as well as bringing new bubble animals.",Who R Zoo?,"[The episode begins at the Bikini Bottom Zoo. Three peacock-like clams are sleeping until they are awoken by SpongeBob's Tarzan yell. A sea tiger opens his mouth as SpongeBob makes his yell inside. SpongeBob comes out of the sea tiger's mouth with a red ball.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Timmy! I've found your ball. And... [holds up a little girl] Your sister.
Ryan Timmy's sister: Hi!
[SpongeBob grabs the sea tiger's uvula and swings on it. SpongeBob gives Timmy/Ryan his sister and ball.]
Ryan Timmy and his sister: [giggles as they play ball] Yeah!
SpongeBob: [lets go of the sea tiger's uvula] A thousand pardons, Sir Sea Tiger. [the sea tiger licks SpongeBob, and he giggles]
[SpongeBob swings over to the sea elephant enclosure and hops onto the sea elephant's head.]
SpongeBob: And the elephant says... [the sea elephant moos like a cow and SpongeBob giggles; he slides down the sea elephant's trunk] Weee! [jumps onto the back of a sea giraffe's long neck] The giraffe goes... [the sea giraffe barks like a dog and throws SpongeBob to the baboon enclosure] And the baboon says... [the baboon quacks like a duck; SpongeBob giggles and is thrown out; he lands on the zookeeper's head] And the zookeeper goes...
Zookeeper: [growls in anger as his mustache is set on fire] Again with this kid?! [SpongeBob hops off] How many times do I have to tell you to stay out of the animal enclosures?! They are not pets! These are wild animals! And you can get [teary-eyed] seriously injured.
SpongeBob: [pets a giant sea monster] These little cuties are dangerous? [laughs as the sea monster roars] Don't be silly.
Zookeeper: [quivers as the sea monster looks at him; angrily] Oh, that's it! [puts an ankle alarm on SpongeBob's left foot]
SpongeBob: For me? Thanks.
Zookeeper: Oh, it's not a gift, it's an ankle alarm. And the next time you try to sneak into the animal enclosures, it's gonna do this... [puts SpongeBob's foot with the ankle alarm through the sea monster's enclosure and the alarm blares]
Alarm: SpongeBob alert! SpongeBob alert! SpongeBob alert!
Zookeeper: Get it?
SpongeBob: Got it.
Zookeeper: Good! [throws SpongeBob out of the zoo]
[SpongeBob sighs in sadness. He secretly heads back into the zoo and tiptoes into the sea giraffe's animal enclosure without triggering his ankle alarm. He hops onto the sea giraffe's back and meows like a cat. SpongeBob and the sea giraffe giggle. The zookeeper finds SpongeBob's foot sticking out of the enclosure.]
Zookeeper: [pulls SpongeBob's foot] Oh, no, you don't!
[The zookeeper struggles to pull SpongeBob out, but the zoo animals try to pull him back. The zookeeper continues to pull until he lifts out all of the zoo animals and gets crushed by them. SpongeBob climbs out of the animal enclosure.]
Zookeeper: [fuming with rage] That's it! You are banned from the zoo! Get out! Out, I say!
SpongeBob: [shrinks to a small size from the zookeeper's outburst] Yes, sir. I'll go. [goes to leave]
Patrick: [appears in the sea monkey enclosure] Hold it! If he goes, I go! [jumps out of the enclosure] And you can keep your dumb old peanuts! [throws peanut shells to the ground] Huh! Come on, SpongeBob. [leaves with SpongeBob]
Zookeeper: And stay out !
[Bubble transition to on top of Patrick's rock. Patrick comforts a crying SpongeBob from the zookeeper's angry outburst.]
Patrick: Oh, that's it now. Let it all out.
SpongeBob: [sobs] I-I just want to pet the critters. Does that make me an animal? [continues to cry]
Patrick: That mean old zookeeper! [scratches his back] He even looks like a monkey and he smells like one too! [scoffs] You should just make your own zoo.
SpongeBob: My own zoo? That's a laugh. [as he cries, a snot bubble forms and floats] Ooh... [catches the snot bubble] Are you thinking what I'm thinking? [the snot bubble pops]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Bubble zoo!
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob creating bubble animals with his bubble soap. He makes a bubble pig, a bubble duck, and a bubble rooster.]
SpongeBob: Voilà! Our first zoo animals.
Patrick: [laughs] Oh, oh, I get to name 'em! Um, your name is Aspen. [pops the bubble pig] Your name is Audrey! [pops the bubble duck] And you're Debbie! [pops the bubble rooster; he then notices that he popped them all and breaks down] Aww, I forgot they're bubbles! [cries]
SpongeBob: [brings in a big container of extra strength bubble soap and talks low] Don't be a dope. Try extra strength soap. [grabs the bubble wand, takes a very deep breath and blows a bubble penguin]
Patrick: [squeezes the bubble penguin, but it doesn't pop] It works! It works!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laugh as they jump up and down] It works! It works!
SpongeBob: [takes another deep breath and blows more bubble animals] Ooh, look at 'em, Patrick. So happy and healthy. [a bubble rhino leaves bubble droppings] Oh, and look, Patrick! Bubble droppings!
Patrick: [hops on SpongeBob's head] Bubble droppings? [happily leaps off and dances on the bubble droppings] I'm popping poops! [laughs before a bubble goat rips off Patrick's pants and eats it] Hey! [the bubble goat belches] But I was gonna eat those!
SpongeBob: [blows a bubble pants for Patrick to wear] No more ""buts."" We need more animals! [inhales and blows some more bubble animals]
[Bubble transition to all of the Bikini Bottom citizens attending SpongeBob and Patrick's bubble zoo.]
SpongeBob: Welcome to the Bubble Zoo! Where the price of admission is a smile. [a buzzer sounds as he stops a frowning customer] Just a second you. [turns the customer's frown upside-down] That's better. [allows the customer to enter]
Patrick: [as the bubble zoo's security guard] Hello, folks. Please leave all your sharp objects at the gate. [stops Old Man Walker] Okay, Grandpa. Spread 'em. [puts on bubble gloves]
[Patrick dumps out a pizza cutter, a pencil, a cactus, darts, and a real-life echidna.]
Old Man Walker: Rascal.
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob showing the customers the bubble elephant enclosure.]
SpongeBob: Gather around, folks, and meet the animals! These wild bubble-phants never forget to have fun. [forms into the word, ""fun"" and laughs; the bubble elephants blow water in SpongeBob's face and sends him flying into the bubble giraffe enclosure where the bubble giraffes are tangled up with their necks] These bubble-raffes are necking. And they have the necks for it. [laughs as the bubble giraffes untangle themselves; SpongeBob's watch beeps] Ooh, time to feed the sea monsters. [a bubble giraffe lowers his neck] Ooh! Alley-zoop! [laughs as the bubble giraffe carries him over to the sea monster enclosure; he blows a bubble rotisserie chicken] Come and get it!
[A bubble piranha jump up and eats the bubble chicken. Then Patrick jumps up and eats the bubble piranha. Then the bubble sea monster pops out, eats Patrick, and swallows him.]
Patrick: Hi! [swims inside the bubble sea monster]
[SpongeBob looks nervously at the audience. But instead of being scared, the audience loves it. Meanwhile, Squidward wakes up from his nap.]
Squidward: [yawns and stretches] ♪ Oh, up from my nap, ya-ta-ta-ta, [goes to the closet] getting my garden pants, ya-ta-ta-ta, [comes out with garden clothes and a hoe] going out the door, ya-ta-ta-ta, [exits his house and steps on the bubble soap] walking on the tongue, ya-ta-ta-ta, [continues walking] that's a lot of teeth, ya-ta-ta... ♪ [He ends up getting swallowed by the bubble sea monster and screams.] What's happening?!
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! I see you're playing with my sea monsters. Isn't my bubble zoo fun?
Squidward: Get me out of here, you moron!
SpongeBob: Okay. [the bubble giraffe sets him down] Oh, Maggie. [tickles the bubble sea monster] Tickle, tickle. Let's put Squidward down. [the bubble giggles and lays a bubble egg with Squidward cramped up in it] Wow! Aww!
Squidward: [grunts as he struggles to break free and pops out of the bubble egg] Blech!
Patrick: And Squidward is reborn!
[The audience cheers.]
Squidward: Now, wait just a darn second, I- [before he can rant, a bubble goat appears and eats his clothes; he sees himself mostly naked with his underpants on and freaks out; he runs over to the bubble rhino enclosure and gets his nose caught in its horn] Uh-oh.
[Squidward unintentionally provokes the bubble rhino and it starts going on a rampage.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Look out, Squidward!
[The bubble rhino stampedes through the bubble zoo and destroys the bubble ticket stand. It then destroys the bubble zoo sign and almost all of the bubble zoo itself, setting all of the bubble zoo animals free. The customers run off in panic.]
Fred: Run for your lives!
SpongeBob: Squidward, don't forget to bring it back! [the bubble zoo animals growl at him] Nice bubble beasts. Uh, let's make you some more enclosures, huh? [the bubble zoo animals trample over SpongeBob and go to wreck havoc in Bikini Bottom]
Patrick: Would now be a good time to talk about my hours?
SpongeBob: [injured and dazed] Stop those animals, Patrick! Go!
Patrick: Huh? Oh! [runs over to the bubble zoo animals and hops onto the bubble elephant's back; he takes the trunk and forms it into a hammer] Stop animules! [starts hammering some of the bubble animals] Stop, stop, stop! [the bubble elephant pulls back its trunk] Huh? [the bubble elephant hammers Patrick off its back and sends him flying back to SpongeBob] But seriously, SpongeBob. Thursdays are out.
[The scene changes to the bubble zoo animals entering the Krusty Krab. The customers run out in panic as the bubble animals begin causing a mayhem in the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: [grabs the cash register and quivers in fear] Take me customers! Just don't hurt me money! [hops onto his cash register and rockets himself out of the restaurant]
[The scene changes to the Chum Bucket being invaded by bubble penguins. Plankton and Karen climb higher to avoid the bubble penguins.]
Plankton: For hate's sake! I spit my last breath at thee! [spits at the bubble penguin, but it only makes it bigger; he screams and climbs up onto Karen's monitor]
Karen: Don't be so dramatic. They're cute. [bubble penguins begin flooding the Chum Bucket] Wait! Wait! [screams alongside with Plankton as they are being surrounded by the bubble penguins]
[SpongeBob and Patrick are being cornered by the bubble zoo animals.]
Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob, why are the animals making scary faces?
SpongeBob: They've gone wild, Patrick! Wild!
[Patrick screams in terror. He opens SpongeBob's body, removes his brain and hides inside him. SpongeBob unleashes a really loud Tarzan yell. The yell was so super loud that the wild animals from the Bikini Bottom Zoo heard it.]
Zookeeper: [hums until he sees the animals out of their enclosures] Hey! This ain't no inferno! Get back in your enclosures right now!
[The zoo animals refuse to listen to the zookeeper and they trample on top of him to go save SpongeBob, which is considered as the zookeeper's punishment for banning SpongeBob from the zoo in the first place.]
Zookeeper: [dazed] Or whenever you know I'm flexible. [passes out]
[The zoo animals arrive at SpongeBob's house just in time before the bubble animals begin their assault.]
Patrick: SpongeBob, it's the zoo animals!
SpongeBob: They must've heard my uvula!
[Patrick climbs out of SpongeBob's mouth. The zoo animals and the bubble animals growl at each other as they are about to go at war. Just then, the sea monster from the zoo appears and lets out a mighty roar. The terrified bubble animals fearfully retreat back into the extra strength bubble soap, leaving the bubble giraffe's head floating until it pops.]
SpongeBob: You guys saved our lives!
Patrick: Thank you, animules!
[The zoo animals cuddle and lick SpongeBob and Patrick out of affection. Bubble transition back to the Bikini Bottom Zoo. It seems that the zookeeper appeared to have apologized to SpongeBob for selfishly banning him from the zoo earlier and is now on good terms with him.]
Zookeeper: And thank you, SpongeBob, for bringing my animals back. And I just love the new animals too. [points to the bubble animals being with the zoo animals in their enclosures] You are welcome at the zoo anytime. I officially remove the ban. [removes the ankle alarm from SpongeBob's leg] There you go.
SpongeBob: I promise you won't regret it, Mr. Zookeeper, sir. [yells like Tarzan and grabs a vine] I'm free again! [swings on the vine] Weee! [swings by Squidward, who is still hanging on the bubble rhino's horn with his nose] Good morning, Squidward!

First, he keeps his hands from his mouth as well as make his nails beautiful to do this, but he still bites his nails. SpongeBob goes for a walk to clear his head but still bites his nails. He sees Fred and starts biting his nails, scaring him off. Afterwards, he finds Mrs. Puff at Nails, where he bites her nails as well.Eventually, he meets up with Patrick and tells him about his nail-biting issue. He brings him to Glove World! to resolve this issue, but SpongeBob starts biting the nails of a glove balloon. After getting kicked out, they call Sandy for help. First she puts a helmet on SpongeBob, but he bites his nails from behind his mouth, so she uses a pillory on his fingers. The three fall asleep after a while, but once Sandy wakes up, she realizes SpongeBob has got out and is biting her nails, making her send him to a hypnotherapist.The hypnotherapist finds out that SpongeBob thinks he is Squidward and has subconsciously implanted the nail-biting habit from him, and that is why he wants to bite his nails. He then gives an order once he snaps his fingers, SpongeBob will become himself again, and his desire to bite ""his"" nails will disappear. He snaps his fingers and he goes back to normal. At first SpongeBob seems fine, but once it turns out that the hypnotherapist was Hans, the hypnosis seems to have backfired and SpongeBob has not completely gotten over his nail-biting habit, so instead of biting his own nails, he bites the nails of Hans. At the same time arrives Squidward due to his weekly appointment and, scared from SpongeBob biting Hans' nails, nervously bites his nails, backs away, and shuts the door, ending the episode from there.",SpongeBob's Bad Habit,"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Squidward is slowly getting angry at the customers' eating habits in the restaurant. He gets angrier and angrier until he finally blows his top.]

SpongeBob: I'm listening, Squidward. Tell SpongeBob your troubles. [giggles as he holds up a microphone]
Squidward: [sighs] If you must know, I'm stuck in a dead-end job working at this grease trap. [squeezes Krabby Patty juice into a cup; Patrick takes the cup and sips the juice] My tentacles hurt. [his suction cups swell up and down] And I live next door to the number one most annoying neighbor in Bikini Bottom. [grumbles]
SpongeBob: [smiles] Whoo! Number one!
Squidward: One more annoying thing, and I'm gonna lose it. [SpongeBob backs down and comes out with a meal while biting his nails; Squidward sighs] And there it is.

Customer #1: That's worse than a hair!
[SpongeBob's fingernail clippings fly into Nat's drink. As Nat drinks his soda, he spits out the fingernail clippings. The clippings fly over to Lady Upturn. Lady Upturn looks at herself in the mirror and screams when she sees fingernail clippings all over her. SpongeBob continues to bite his nails as the customers react in disgust. SpongeBob goes back to the kitchen and spits out fingernail clippings in Squidward's face.]

SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, I never bite my nails. [bites his nails]

Squidward: Ugh, nail-biting is a disgusting bad habit, so quit it!
SpongeBob: I promise not to bite my nails ever again. [looks at his nails and goes to bite them]
Squidward: Ahem!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oops. I guess biting my nails has become a bad habit.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob going back home from the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Oh, breaking this nail-biting habit'll be a snap. [tries to resist his nail-biting habit, but couldn't; he sits in his chair with his hands under him] Just have to keep my nails away...

Gary: Meow.
[SpongeBob looks at his nails and sees Krabby Patties partially eaten from the bitten fingernails.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What's that? [Gary holds up a leash] Oh, what a great idea, Gary. A walk would really clear my head.
[SpongeBob exits the house, leaving Gary behind.]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: [walks down the streets of Bikini Bottom and sniffs the air] Ah, I just needed a breath of fresh water. [sniffs] Ah. [resumes biting his nails, but stops immediately; he ties his hands in double knots] That'll take care of it. [his feet flip off his shoes and forces SpongeBob to bite his toenails] Oh, don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it! [sniffs off his socks and bites his toenails, before stopping] Well...I do'd it. [giggles in embarrassment and pulls his feet out of his mouth] Time for stronger measures. [ties his arms and legs in double knots] All right, self, let's see ya get out of that one. [rolls himself down the road and bumps into Fred]
Fred: Whoa, SpongeBob, are you okay? [lends SpongeBob a helping hand]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Fred, your nails. They're so...beautiful.

Patrick: Hmm. Mm-hmm. Ha! I know just what you need! [grabs SpongeBob and carries him over to Glove World!] Glove World! makes me forget all my troubles...and my name.
SpongeBob: You're right. I've forgotten all about biting my... [sees a glove-shaped balloon] nails!

[The scene changes to SpongeBob back at his house while still biting his nails. Sandy is observing SpongeBob's nail-biting problem and tries to figure out the solution to it.]
Sandy: Don't worry, SpongeBob. We'll stop your nail-biting habit quicker than a jet-powered jackrabbit! [puts a water helmet on SpongeBob] This'll keep your fingers out of your kisser.
SpongeBob: I sure hope so.
[It works for a little while, but SpongeBob's hands cannot resist the non-stop nail-biting habit. His hands try to break through the water helmet, but it is too strong. His arms go into his body and start biting his fingernails on the inside.]
Sandy: Tell me he ain't doing what I think he's doing.
Patrick: Oh, he's good.
[SpongeBob's teeth inside his mouth are literally biting his fingernails, grossing Sandy and Patrick out.]
Sandy: SpongeBob, that's just plain wrong.
[Later that night, Sandy places SpongeBob's fingers and feet in a pillory.]
Sandy: I guess we're gonna have to watch you like Mr. Krabs watches his bank account!
[After a short while, the pillory seems to work. But SpongeBob's toes and fingers wiggle, much to Sandy's dismay. For a while, Sandy is sound asleep. She wakes up and sees SpongeBob and Patrick asleep. Then she goes back to sleep. And after a while, she walks up and sees Patrick sleeping in SpongeBob's chair. And the pillory that was holding SpongeBob is unlocked.]
Sandy: What, what?! Where'd he go? [feels something in her sleeve, removes it and sees SpongeBob biting her nails]
SpongeBob: [chews on Sandy's nails] Hi, Sandy.
Sandy: It's high time we got you some professional help.
[The scene changes to Sandy and Patrick taking SpongeBob to hypnotherapy.]
Sandy: This doctor's the best hypnotherapist in Bikini Bottom. He'll sort out your bad habit.
Receptionist: [through speaker] The doctor will see you now, Mr. SquarePants.
[SpongeBob enters a dark room while biting his nails.]
Hans: [off-screen] Oh, please relax, Mr. SquarePants. Now, what seems to be the trouble?
SpongeBob: Doctor, I can't stop... [bites his nails] I can't stop... [bites his nails] I can't stop biting my nails! I don't know what to do! [bites his nails]
Hans: [turns on the light] Well, let us take a peak into your subconscious and see what is causing your problem. [waves watch] Keep your eyes on the watch, Mr. SquarePants. Watch the watch, Mr. SquarePants.
SpongeBob: Watch the watch...watch the watch... [gets hypnotized and feels woozy] Watch the watch.
Hans: [keeps waving the watch] What seems to be troubling you, Mr. SquarePants?
SpongeBob: [his spiraling eyes pop out of his head] I can't stop...biting my...nails.
Hans: Why do you want to bite your nails?
SpongeBob: Stuck in dead-end job. [holds up Krabby Patty] Work in a grease trap. [squeezes juice out of the Krabby Patty]
Hans: Go on.
SpongeBob: [his hands appear as tentacles and the swell up and down] Tentacles hurt.
Hans: Tentacles? Hmm, interesting.
SpongeBob: Neighbor...SpongeBob... [his nose forms into Squidward's nose] annoying.
Hans: But aren't you SpongeBob, Mr. SquarePants? [stops waving the watch]
SpongeBob: [his head appears as Squidward] No...I am Squidward.
Hans: [gasps] Mr. SquarePants! Obviously, you have subconsciously internalized Mr. Squidward's problems as your own. When I snap my fingers, you'll realize you are not Squidward. You are SpongeBob, and your desire to bite your nails will—Poof! Disappear. [snaps his fingers and SpongeBob wakes up from the trance]
SpongeBob: [gasps and looks around] Am I cured?
Hans: Yeah, you are cured.
SpongeBob: Whoopee! Thanks, Doctor...Doctor... [the lights turn back on] Hans?! [gasps as he sees Hans' fingernails] Giant, delicious fingernails! [hops onto Hans and goes to bite his nails]
Hans: Mr. SquarePants, please!
Squidward: [enters the room] Doctor Hans, I'm here for my weekly appointment... [sees SpongeBob biting Hans' nails and gets scared] I'm going to need therapy for my therapy... [nervously bites his nails, backs away, and shuts the door]",1.43,Luke Brookshier

The Dirty Bubble is seen to have already tied Al Gristlepuss onto an aerial. He threatens the Bikini Bottomites that he will eat the police chief unless they act for him. Perch Perkins comes up to make a further statement on the Dirty Bubble's predicted actions. However, the Dirty Bubble strangles him with his tongue, ready to eat him. Just as he is about to eat Perch Perkins, the police come up to the radio station top to grab the Dirty Bubble with bubble wands, ordering him to drop Perch Perkins. The Dirty Bubble is then arrested and placed into a glass jar.After the Dirty Bubble serves his 6-month pretrial release, he is released as the Clean Bubble. The Clean Bubble feels refreshed as a new self. The warden warns him that he must ensure his cleanliness or else he would become evil again. Afterward, the Clean Bubble is released to work at the Krusty Krab. He assures he will not become dirty.When the Clean Bubble reaches the Krusty Krab, he is excited to work there. He wants to work as a waiter or a cash register. However, Mr. Krabs assigns him a cleaning job of washing dishes. SpongeBob, who comes back from the freezer to cook some patties onto the grill, greets him. The Clean Bubble refers to himself as ""DB.""The Clean Bubble begins scrubbing the dirty dishes, which causes him to turn back into the Dirty Bubble. He surprises SpongeBob at his sudden return. SpongeBob, thinking that the Dirty Bubble kidnapped the Clean Bubble, threatens to wash him down with the sink hose, then sprays out water at the Dirty Bubble. SpongeBob noticed that the Dirty Bubble became the Clean Bubble, and realizes that ""DB is short for Dirty Bubble."" The Clean Bubble tells him that he is trying to change his personality by staying clean. SpongeBob assures that he will promise to keep him squeaky clean. He gives a handshake to him.Mr. Krabs reveals to the Clean Bubble that his new job will be to scrub the dirty toilets. SpongeBob assures that he will clean the toilets. The Clean Bubble stares in the toilet and hallucinates over ""beautiful"" dirt. He goes into the toilet to transform slowly into the Dirty Bubble. He then causes havoc to people in the toilet. SpongeBob runs off and spits out absorbed sink water onto the Dirty Bubble to transform him to become clean again. Elaine then reports in comic book form about SpongeBob's continual duty to prevent Clean Bubble from turning into the Dirty Bubble.Back at the Krusty Krab, the Clean Bubble is a waiter for the customers. SpongeBob compliments him for not being dirty for weeks. But Patrick comes in to mention more about dirtiness, specifically his dirty belly button gunk. He flicks it to the Clean Bubble by pure unawareness, and accidentally reformed the Dirty Bubble. The Dirty Bubble came out to cause even more havoc in Bikini Bottom. Patrick considers this transformation special, but SpongeBob knows it means trouble.The Realistic Fish Head reports again on the Dirty Bubble's re-premise, stating that the Dirty Bubble has come back to do dirty deeds to some Bikini Bottomites. Some of these include ruining a perfect mud bath for two kids, turning a pirate into a chubby sailor, smashing a building cleaned by himself, and literally wiping out an old teacher's face in Poseidon Elementary. Afterward, the Dirty Bubble inverted Perch Perkins' face, after Perch Perkins reported about wiping out the teacher's face.SpongeBob attempts to hose down the grime off the Dirty Bubble, but the grime is too strong. The Dirty Bubble eats the hose and attacks SpongeBob with five miniature Dirty Bubbles. SpongeBob eventually pops them all, leaving the Dirty Bubble slightly stumped. SpongeBob launches himself toward the Dirty Bubble to try to pop him with his spatula, but bounces off. He chases after SpongeBob and eats him to trap him. The Dirty Bubble decides to eat Goo Lagoon next.SpongeBob, struggling to escape the thick walls of the Dirty Bubble, grabs out his pencil to write down his last words, knowing that he will eventually drown in the accumulating Goo Lagoon goo. However, knowing that he is able to absorb liquids from his surroundings, begins to spin around the Dirty Bubble. Dirty Bubble tells him to stop spinning, but fails to stop him, and eventually became absorbed into SpongeBob. SpongeBob burps out a tiny version of the Dirty Bubble.Just as the Dirty Bubble tries to cause more trouble as a small bubble, the police arrest him by trapping him in another jar. The lady officer thanks SpongeBob for contributing to the Dirty Bubble's arrest. SpongeBob sneezes the entirety of Goo Lagoon's goo everywhere, much to the anger of the officers. SpongeBob grabs a tissue to wipe out the goo from the lady officer's face.",Dirty Bubble Returns,"[The episode begins with a Bikini Bottom News flash.]
Realistic Fish Head: This is a Bikini Bottom News special report. [the screen shows Perch Perkins at the Bikini Bottom power plant with the police] Perch?
Perch Perkins: Perch Perkins here at the Bikini Bottom power plant, where the evil supervillain known as the Dirty Bubble has finally been cornered by police!
[The Dirty Bubble is at the very top of the power plant, holding the police chief hostage.]
Dirty Bubble: Stand back, coppers, and cease your attack, or I'll make your police chief my late night snack! [laughs and holds the chief in the air with his tongue]
Police chief: Do what he says! [groans as the Dirty Bubble squeezes him tighter]
Perch Perkins: [appears from the left] Will the grime of this evil soap globe wash over our fair city? Or will the law force him to clean up his act?
Dirty Bubble: [releases the police chief and grabs Perch] Or will he choose door number three, and devour a newsman live on TV? [laughs as he goes to eat Perch]
[Just then, three officers seize the Dirty Bubble with giant bubble wands.]
Officer Slugfish: Drop him, airhead!
[The officers force the Dirty Bubble to let Perch go.]
Perch Perkins: Yike! [falls off-screen]
Officer Johnson: [grunts while seizing the Dirty Bubble] I got him!
[The officers shove the Dirty Bubble into the bottle.]
Dirty Bubble: Remember this face and remember it well, so you'll recognize me when I see you in— [gets pushed into the bottle by the chief]
Police chief: Jail!
[The Dirty Bubble, still in the bottle, is placed in a prison cell in Bikini Bottom Jail.]
Realistic Fish Head: Six months later...
[Two men carry the bottle containing the dirty bubble inside. One man opens the bottle, takes out the bubble wand, dips it into the liquid and blows out the Dirty Bubble, now sparky clean and reformed.]
Clean Bubble: Thank you, warden. I feel like a new bubble. [laughs]
Warden: Remember, Bubble, keep it clean, or you'll get mean. [gives the Clean Bubble a handshake]
Clean Bubble: Thank you, warden. I promise I won't let you down! [puts on his hat]
Warden: [holds out a paper with KK on it] Here's the address of your new job. [gives the paper to the Clean Bubble and blows him away with a fan]
Clean Bubble: I'll make you proud, warden. Stay clean or you'll get mean. A new life. No more dirt, and no more wrong turns. [crashes into the Krusty Krab sign] The Krusty Krab. Hm, this must be the place! [enters the restaurant and gives a friendly handshake to Mr. Krabs] Oh, I can't thank you enough for this job, Mr. Krabs. What would you like me to do? [slams his face into the glass doors] Greet people at the door? Serve the food?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no. I've got a special job that need someone with your special talents. You're on dirty dish detail.
Clean Bubble: [gets real nervous when he sees a pile of dirty dishes] D-d-d-d-dirty dishes? Wait, couldn't I just work the cash register or something?
Mr. Krabs: Listen, I hired a dish-washing bubble to save money on soap, and I want these plates sparkling by lunchtime, savvy?
Clean Bubble: Just call me Sparkles.
[The Clean Bubble becomes nervous and looks at the dirty dishes. One drop of slime nearly hits the Clean Bubble.]
Clean Bubble: [sweating] Stay clean, or you'll get mean. Stay clean, or you'll get mean.
[Pans screen to the right, to reveal what appears to be a walking stack of frozen Krabby Patties coming out of the freezer.]
Clean Bubble: Ah?
[SpongeBob removes all the frozen Krabby Patties from himself and places them onto the grill]
SpongeBob: Yeah. [shivers] Brr! Is there a blizzard coming in, 'cause I've got a cold front.
[The Clean Bubble and SpongeBob laugh.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi! I didn't see you there, you must be the new dishwasher. Welcome aboard! I'm SpongeBob.
Clean Bubble: Hi, SpongeBob, I'm, uh...um...uh... DB, yeah... DB.
SpongeBob: Oh, we're gonna have so much fun, DB. [gasps] We'll be galley pallies!
[Squidward rings the desk bell multiple times]
SpongeBob: Whoops. [grabs spatula from his hat] Back to work! [flips patties while singing to self]
Clean Bubble: [shudders] Keep it clean, or you'll get mean. [cleaning a dirty dish] Keep it clean, or you'll get mean!
[Dish is sparkling clean. Clean Bubble gasps.]
Clean Bubble: Huh. Hey, I did it! I got dirty and I didn't turn evil! Huh, I must be cured!
[Clean Bubble continuously cleans the dirty dishes with his body, while beginning to turn evil.]
Clean Bubble: Scraping up filth, from between every crack! [transforms to the Dirty Bubble]
Dirty Bubble: I'm the Dirty Bubble, and, baby, I'm back! [evil laugh]
SpongeBob: Oh, what can I get you, Dirty Bubble? [Whistles while flipping a patty. Suddenly turns back surprised. Screams.]
[The Dirty Bubble evilly laughs.]
SpongeBob: Dirty Bubble! Where's that nice DB? What did you do to him, you super filthy supervillain?
[The Dirty Bubble evilly laughs at SpongeBob's face, causing SpongeBob to shriek. As the Dirty Bubble gets closer to SpongeBob, SpongeBob threatens to spray at him with the sink hose.]
SpongeBob: What did you do with DB? [Sobs. Looks at the newly transformed Clean Bubble.]
[Clean Bubble glows and smiles]
SpongeBob: DB is short for Dirty Bubble, isn't it?
Clean Bubble: Yes, SpongeBob, it's me. I'm trying to change my evil ways and stay clean.
SpongeBob: Wow, a supervillain intervention! I'll help you, DB. I'll make sure you stay squeaky clean and dirt-free! [offers a handshake]
[Clean Bubble happily offers a handshake]
Mr. Krabs: [comes from the right with an electric fan, blowing away the Clean Bubble and SpongeBob] Attention, Mr. Bubble, I've got another job for you!
[Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs and the Clean Bubble at the bathroom]
Mr. Krabs: Now, this new job is very exclusive and very French.
Clean Bubble: Hmm? Ooh-la-la! [smiles]
Mr. Krabs: [kicks open a filthy toilet] Eau de Toilette!
Clean Bubble: [gasps] Oh, sacre-pew! [frowns in worried disgust]
Mr. Krabs: [pointing at him] Make it sparkle! [pulls up pants, and walks off, humming]
[SpongeBob peeks out from the bathroom]
SpongeBob: Okay, he's gone. Don't worry about those toilets, DB. [grabs a toilet scrubber from his hat] I will clean them for you. Tout suite, mon ami. [laughs]
[Clean Bubble enthusiastically flushes the closest toilet. His eyes hallucinate.]
Clean Bubble: Dirt, dirt! Beautiful dirt! [goes into the toilet]
SpongeBob: Zut alors! [checks toilet] DB? [Peeks into toilet, and gasps as the Dirty Bubble gradually comes out. Runs off from toilet cubicle] Incoming!
[The Dirty Bubble laughs evilly and repeatedly sings ""Alouette"" into each toilet, and shoves customers down the toilet. Fred screams while running away.]
Dirty Bubble: Pow! Hold onto your shirty, here comes the dirty!
[SpongeBob hoses down the Dirty Bubble with absorbed sink water. The Clean Bubble is transformed back.]
Clean Bubble: Thanks for keeping me clean, SpongeBob! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, DB. We just needed to wash away that stinkin' thinkin'!
[Bubble transition to a reveal a comic book named ""Dirty Bubble Returns!""]
Realistic Fish Head: For weeks, SpongeBob worked with DB to stay clean and good!
[Scene moves from a comic frame with Dirty Bubble stealing Patrick's chocolate-coated strawberry ice cream to SpongeBob hosing down on the Dirty Bubble into the Clean Bubble with a spray bottle.]
Comic SpongeBob: Ta-da!
[Dirty Bubble then appears in a comic frame where he has appeared in a laundromat, but SpongeBob grabs him and places him into the washing machine while Old Man Jenkins still has clean washed clothes.]
[The Dirty Bubble appears yet again in another comic frame where he spits out a fountain of mud onto a bus ""White Suit Society"" while the fish of the bus scream and panic. SpongeBob comes in surfing and washes the Dirty Bubble down while laughing. The Clean Bubble comes on the surfboard]
[Bubble transition back to the Krusty Krab. Squidward is sleeping at the cash register area, while SpongeBob mops the floor. The Clean Bubble comes in to serve a tray of three Krabby Patties and two drinks, while whistling.]
Clean Bubble: [serves the tray to the family of customers] Enjoy those patties! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Well, DB, looks like you're cured. You haven't been dirty in weeks!
Clean Bubble: Thanks to you, SpongeBob, I'll never be dirty again! [laughs]
Patrick: Oh, speaking of dirty... [Picks his belly button to reveal bellybutton gunk. Patrick stares at it menacingly, and flicks it off.] Ew!
[The bellybutton gunk lands on the Clean Bubble. The gunk spreads around him. The gunk finally cracks open to reveal the Dirty Bubble]
Dirty Bubble: [laughs evilly] You want me clean, but I ain't willing! I've gotta be me , and me is a villain! [Evilly laughs. Looks left and right, then moves out to the left]
Patrick: [sheds a tear] Aww... That's nice. He found his rainbow.
SpongeBob: [surprised face] Uh-oh. [nervous face]
[At a news report of Dirty Bubble]
Realistic Fish Head: The Dirty Bubble has been seen everywhere, defiling dozens of decent denizens with dirty deeds!
[The scene cuts to two kids playing with mud. The Dirty Bubble sucks up everything in the mud pit including the mud and kids. He spits out the kids clean.]
Girl and boy: Clean? [looks at each other and perfectly cut cries]
[The scene changes to the cabin of an abandoned ship named ""The Buccaneer,"" surrounded by a number of landmines]
Pirate: So I says to the scallywag, ""Listen here, you–"" [The Dirty Bubble cleans him, transforming him into a chubby sailor.]

Perch Perkins: Breaking news, the Dirty Bubble just wiped all the teacher's dirty looks right off their faces! Who will be next?
Dirty Bubble: [comes up to Perch Perkins and rubs his face off] No more pencils, no more books, no more news guy's dirty looks! [evil laugh, kisses Perkin's face revealing it is inverted]
Perch Perkins: No– Oh, that got in my mouth!
[Dirty Bubble kicks out Perkins]
Dirty Bubble: [evil laughs, but gets hosed] Oh!
SpongeBob: Sorry, old chum, but from now on, you're gonna have to stay clean for good!

[proceeds to spin around inside like clothes in a side-loader washing machine]
Dirty Bubble: Wait, what? Ow, just... stop spinning, you sponge! You're stealing my grunge! [slowly shrinks, stammering] Stuff that rhymes! [screams as he is absorbed by SpongeBob]
[SpongeBob falls into Goo Lagoon's seabed. Burps out an shrunken version of the Dirty Bubble.]

[Dirty Bubble spits dirt onto SpongeBob's eyelid. Officer Johnson catches Dirty Bubble and puts him into a jar held by lady officer]

SpongeBob: Every time I wash dishes, I'll think of you.
Dirty Bubble: Hmph. Every time I have nightmares, I'll think of you, too! [complaining noises]
Lady officer: Thank you, citizen. We'll take it from here.
SpongeBob: [pretends to be the Dirty Bubble] It was a dirty job, but somebody had to do it. [evil laugh]

When they go inside, they realize the supposed baby is extremely ugly and can talk, but they still treat her like a regular baby and name her Baby Prunes.The two feed, play games, and put Baby Prunes to bed, and afterwards, SpongeBob goes into the bathroom preparing a bath for her. In there, he finally realizes that Baby Prunes is actually an extremely old woman, after spotting her last 137th birthday card. Unfortunately, a sleepy Patrick accidentally lets her run free due to him thinking she is a dog, before SpongeBob can tell him that she is not a baby.

SpongeBob has five spoons on his head until Patrick puts another one on his head. With six spoons, Patrick lifts SpongeBob up and dips the spoons in baby food. SpongeBob feeds the babies until they stop crying. A baby is seen on the shelf, knocking plates over. SpongeBob catches the plates, so they won't break. The baby falls off the shelf SpongeBob screams and manages to catch the baby. SpongeBob is relieved that he caught the baby, but the plates fall over the floor.

Mary: Oh, boys, right here! Oh, I could use a babysitter!
Patrick: Yay!
SpongeBob: Ooh! [they rush towards Mary] While you go out, and dance, and revel...
Patrick: ...We will watch your little devil!
[SpongeBob and Patrick swirl her around.]
Mary: Yes! [hugs Patrick] Oh, thank you! [hugs SpongeBob then runs off] Thank you!
SpongeBob: Wait! Where's the baby?
Mary: She's inside! I'm free! I'm free! Hahahahaha!
[Mary hops away happily while SpongeBob and Patrick look confused at each other. But they both shrug and enters the house.]
SpongeBob: Baby! [shakes the rattle] Baby?
Patrick: [holds up a pillow] Is this the baby?
SpongeBob: Hmm? No, I- I don't think so.
Patrick: Huh. Oh! [holds up a lamp] This looks like a nice baby girl. [turns the lamp on]
SpongeBob: She's nice, but she's not a baby. [Patrick throws the lamp] Wait a minute. [runs to a wheelchair and looks down] Aww, I found the baby.
[SpongeBob turns the wheelchair around and shows Patrick the baby. But it isn't a baby, it is Mary's mother from ""Chocolate with Nuts."" She is shown asleep and it startles Patrick.]
Patrick: Eek! That's the ugliest baby I've ever seen!
SpongeBob: Patrick, all babies are beautiful. Even the ugly ones, and we don't know the baby's name is.
Patrick: She looks like she's been in the tub too long. Let's call her Baby Prunes.
SpongeBob: What a pretty name! Little Baby Prunes.
[They both laugh until Baby Prunes wakes up and screams as she sees SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Baby Prunes: Who are you?! Where's lazy Mary?!
Patrick: The baby can talk!
Baby Prunes: Help! Help! It's a robbery!
[SpongeBob puts a pacifier in her mouth]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, Baby Prunes is just mimicking what she's heard. It's just baby talk. She's babbling.
Baby Prunes: [spits out the pacifier] I'm not babbling, you bone heads!
Patrick: Din-din time! [pulls out a spoon full of food] Here comes the airplane. [makes train noises and puts the food into Baby Prunes' mouth, but she spits it out, which Patrick swallows] Yum. Playtime! [dumps out some blocks and throws the bottle away] Kids love to build things with blocks!
Baby Prunes: [chuckles] Oh, I'll build something, alright.
[Bubble transition to all the blocks built into a jail with SpongeBob and Patrick in it. SpongeBob writes on the wall. Inside the play jail, there is a toilet, a pipe, a bunch, and a shelf filled with books. SpongeBob checks his watch.]
SpongeBob: Whoa, Patrick, we've been playing in here for three hours. Better check on Baby Prunes. You know what's the best part about playing jail?
Patrick: No.
SpongeBob: Jailbreak! [smashes through the block jail]
Patrick: Jailbreak! [runs the opposite way, running into the wall and making him wobble in the correct direction]
Baby Prunes: [picking the door lock with her tongue] I gotta pick this lock and get outta here.
SpongeBob: Oh, there you are!
Baby Prunes: Come on, come on.
SpongeBob: Nap time! [picks up Baby Prunes and carries her away from the door with her tongue still on the lock]
Baby Prunes: [her tongue leaves the lock] Put me down, you yellow scouring pad! Unhand me! [cuts to SpongeBob walking to a spot in Mary's house and Patrick pulls out a baby cradle] No! [SpongeBob puts Baby Prunes in the cradle] Get me out of here! [SpongeBob puts on a baby bonnet on Baby Prunes, tucks her in a blanket, and staples it to the cradle] Ow! Ugh! Ouch! Get your... [screams]
SpongeBob: Oooo! Who's a colicky baby? It's you! [tickles Baby Prunes in the neck with one finger] Coochy coochy coo!
Baby Prunes: Bleh.
SpongeBob: I'll go up and prepare a bath for Baby Prunes for when she wakes up.
Patrick: Okay. While you're doing that I'll just space out. [starts spacing out] Uhhh...
[As SpongeBob goes upstairs, Patrick's eyes turn upwards and drools. Baby Prunes looks at Patrick with his eyes upwards and then escapes from the cradle by using a secret door at the bottom of the cradle, and runs away chuckling evilly. Meanwhile, upstairs, SpongeBob is in Mary's bathroom. SpongeBob turns on a faucet in the bathtub.]
SpongeBob: Hmm, strange... There don't seem to be any baby items in here. Hmm... [looks in a cabinet to find not baby items but old-woman stuff] Okay, pills, pills, dentures, more pills, hemorrhoid cream. [closes the cabinet but then notices a little birthday note stuck on the bottom-left corner of the cabinet] ""Happy birthday to mother on her 137th birthday."" Aw. [gasps and realizes the truth] 137th birthday?! [hyperventilating] Oh! Baby Prunes isn't a baby, she's an old lady!
[Meanwhile, Baby Prunes is trying to escape from Mary's house by using her tongue to unlock the door.]
Baby Prunes: Come on, come on! [just then Patrick comes along with his eyes still upwards]
Patrick: Is that a puppy I hear? I didn't know they had a puppy. What is it, puppy? You wanna go out? [Baby Prunes frees her tongue out, and a light bulb appears on top of her head]
Baby Prunes: Oh. [barking]
Patrick: [opens the front door] There you go, puppy.
Baby Prunes: So long sucker! [maniacal laughing] Uh... [barking]
Patrick: Huh, the puppy knows baby talk too... [just then SpongeBob comes in from the stairs]
SpongeBob: Patrick! She's not a baby! [falls from down the stairs and hits Patrick and looks around while he's on Patrick's stomach] Where's Baby Prunes?
Patrick: I dunno, I just let the puppy out.
SpongeBob: That was no puppy! [jumps on Patrick's stomach] That was an old lady! An old lady that we're responsible for! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run outside to find Baby Prunes]
SpongeBob: If you were an old lady, where would you go?!
Patrick: Ah, I don't know, back in time?!
SpongeBob: What about a sewing circle?
Patrick: Ah, yes. A sewing circle back in time!
SpongeBob: Come on! [pulls Patrick with him]
[SpongeBob and Patrick go into a sewing circle with some old ladies.]
SpongeBob: [kicks the door open] Old lady Prunes?! [the old ladies look at SpongeBob and Patrick in wonder] Have you seen a baby that's really an old lady?
Bakery cashier: Oh, look. They have schmutz on their faces! [spits on a napkin, then the other women follow]
SpongeBob: No! Not that!
[Patrick and SpongeBob are scared while the old ladies rub the napkin on their bodies.]
SpongeBob: Ah, where's Baby/Old Lady Prunes?!
Patrick: No! No, gross!
[Patrick is disgusted while the old ladies rub them.]
French Narrator: Meanwhile... [cuts to a scene with an erupting volcano]
Surfers: Yeah!
Baby Prunes: Yee-haw! Lavabunga! [while she is having fun, the other surfers are gone and lose the challenge]
Surfer: Dude!
Surfer 2: Uh, I'm okay!
[Baby Prunes laughs maniacally, then we cut to a scene where people are parachuting.]
Skydivers: Yeah! [they jump off of the plane and skydive]
Skydiver: What are you doing, you don't have a parachute!
Baby Prunes: Aw, parachutes are for babies! [she jumps and laughs maniacally while the skydiver is surprised] Oh yeah! [she falls into a haystack and laughs maniacally]
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick on the road, looking for old lady Prunes.]
SpongeBob: Prunes!
Patrick: Old lady Prunes!
SpongeBob: Old lady Baby Prunes! [Baby Prunes is wrestling and throws a boxer on SpongeBob and Patrick]
Baby Prunes: [breaks through the entrance with a boxing glove] Well, if it isn't my two babysitters! You humiliated me!
SpongeBob: Prunes, you're alive!
Patrick: And still talking baby talk! [they run to her and she mumbles angrily]
Baby Prunes: Why, I oughta! [punches them in the face, knocking them away]
SpongeBob: Ahh, Prunie wants to play, nice old lady. [she repeatedly hits them until they become realistic]
[Baby Prunes starts getting tired and floats onto the ground, sleeping.]
Patrick: Aw, her boxing tuckered her out. [then they fall out of the tree]
[SpongeBob picks up Baby Prunes and cradles her, putting her into her wheelchair.]
Patrick: Aww...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Shh...
SpongeBob: Ah, another job well done. [sniffs] Uh, Patrick, I think she needs to be changed.
Patrick: No, that's me.

He then tells SpongeBob he is concerned about his health. SpongeBob freaks out and wants to know what is wrong with his health. Squidward says there is something wrong with the gap in his teeth, and that something can get caught in there and obstruct his breathing. So SpongeBob demands a doctor, but Squidward offers to be his dentist.He takes SpongeBob to the kitchen and forces his two teeth together, but this causes SpongeBob's voice to become deeper and more smooth sounding along with no more whistling sound. SpongeBob notices his new change in voice as a jazz singer and starts to sing. Squidward and the customers in the Krusty Krab take notice of the singing. They crowd around to listen to his music. Squidward notices this as a chance to be cool as well. So, he asks SpongeBob to join him in going to his favorite Jazz club, Blow Your Top Lounge. SpongeBob accepts the offer.That night, Squidward barges into the club and attempts to act cool, but everyone else is not impressed. Then SpongeBob comes in and everyone is impressed at how cool he is. So, they are surprised Squidward is his friend and guess if he is a friend of SpongeBob, he is cool. The only person skeptical of Squidward is kicked away by him. Squidward encourages SpongeBob to start singing, and so he goes on stage. Also, Squidward follows along with his clarinet, only to be tricked into putting a cork in his clarinet.SpongeBob once again wows them with his music. But his teeth separate while singing, changing his voice back to normal, forcing Squidward to take teeth from another fish and put them in SpongeBob's mouth. The teeth fall out and shatter at the end of the performance. Squidward wants to leave the club and says to everyone that they will return again tomorrow. He takes him back to the Krusty Krab and cements his teeth back together. Then they return to the club to play. Once again, his teeth separate. So Squidward once again cements his teeth together. Then SpongeBob allows Squidward to do a solo with his clarinet. Squidward eventually blows so hard he launches the cork out, turning back to the music the club hates.A bodyguard then grabs him and throws him outside. Oblivious to his lack of talent but angry at being overlooked, Squidward goes back to make the gap again. He charges with a hammer, only to be blown away by SpongeBob's music bubbles. He crashes into the lights and sandbags, which fall to the ground, all missing SpongeBob. That is, until he runs into a sandbag still hanging and crashes to the ground. SpongeBob then realizes his gap is back. So Squidward comes out and calls him a fraud, but SpongeBob does not seem to mind now that he has his whistle back, and so he whistles.Everyone else in the club is impressed, and they slam their heads to make gaps in their teeth. Squidward attempts to leave, only to be stopped by the bodyguard and the manager tells him to pay for the damages done to the building when SpongeBob blew the roof off with his singing.",Mind the Gap,"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is flipping patties on the grill while whistling through his gap teeth. Squidward covers his ears and his face turns bright red as he finds SpongeBob's whistling deeply annoying. SpongeBob throws a tray full of food on Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, order up!
Squidward: [grabs SpongeBob's mouth] SpongeBob! Don't you know how to keep quiet?!
SpongeBob: I don't know, but hum a few bars, and maybe I can fake it. [laughs as a rimshot is heard]
Squidward: [groans angrily and lets go of SpongeBob as he slowly calms down and comes up with an idea] Sorry for getting angry with you, SpongeBob. I'm just very concerned about your health, that's all.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's okay, Squidward. [hops into Squidward's arms] You know, just the other day, I—what, my health?!
Squidward: Yeah, it's probably nothing. [sets SpongeBob down] Forget I brought it up.
SpongeBob: What about my health, Squidward? [clings on Squidward's head and spins him around] What do you know? What's my body been saying behind my back?
Squidward: [puts SpongeBob down and his head spins back] Well, if you really want to know, it's the gap between your teeth.
SpongeBob: My gap? [looks himself in the mirror] I have a gap? What's wrong with my gap?! [sneaks up behind a customer] Gap!
Squidward: [grabs SpongeBob] A gap that big between your teeth can be extremely dangerous. You can get something caught in it. [jams a cork between SpongeBob's teeth] It obstructs your airway, and now, you can't breath.
SpongeBob: [wheezes] I can't breathe. I can't breathe! Call a doctor!
Squidward: [removes cork from SpongeBob's teeth] No need to call a doctor, SpongeBob. I will be your dentist. [pushes SpongeBob back into the kitchen]
SpongeBob: You will?
Squidward: [sets SpongeBob on a chair, opens his mouth and looks at the gap] Guess I gotta use good old-fashioned tentacle grease. [puts on gloves and attempts to close the gap, but fails as it pushes him back; takes a drill and drills the gap together] All better. That should seal up that drafty gap. [quietly] And kill the whistling. [laughs as he walks out]
SpongeBob: [starts talking in a deeper voice] Well, thank you, Dr. Squidward! [pauses for a bit] Say, without a gap, my voice sounds almost...cool. [taps his neck] Testing, testing, one, two, three. You know, with this voice, I don't need whistling. [spins] Oh, I've got to sing! [snaps his fingers and starts to sing while flipping patties] Flip, flip, flip, flop! [sings in jazzy scats] Sizzle-a-roonie!
[Outside, Squidward is sleeping. As SpongeBob continues to sing, musical notes wakes Squidward up.]
Squidward: Oh, where is that heavenly voice coming from? [the musical notes pick him up and turn him around] I must—huh?! [sees SpongeBob singing thanks to the closed gap] Oh, blowfish! Does he have to ruin everything for me?! [groans]
[SpongeBob's singing catches the customers' attention.]
Incidental 48: What a dreamy voice!
Incidental 36: Wow, it really swings.
[The musical notes pick them up and carry them to the kitchen. They sing SpongeBob flipping patties and singing with a cool voice.]
Incidental 41: Hey, everybody, look. SpongeBob is cool now!
[The customers are in awe at SpongeBob's new talent. Squidward comes up with another idea.]
Squidward: [smiles evilly] Hmm, maybe I can use SpongeBob to get in with all those cool people at the jazz club. Yeah! [slithers himself out of the register boat and enters the kitchen]
SpongeBob: [sings] Yeah.
Squidward: Hey, SpongeBob. [burns his hand on the grill] Owie, owie, owie, owie! Um, how would you like to accompany me to my favorite jazz club tonight?
SpongeBob: Oh, boy, would I? That sounds so cool. [gently punches Squidward's burnt hand]
Customers: Aw!
[The musical notes transition to the Blow Your Top Lounge at nighttime. Squidward enters the place through the doors. One the stage, a drummer is playing the bongos in front of a live audience at the club. He stops playing and the audience snap their fingers as an applause.]
Cool Patron #1: Oh, man, that beat is so pure, it hurts.
Squidward: Ah, my people! [enters the lounge] Hey, hipsters. It's groovy, cats. I can dig it.
Cool Patrons: Lame.
Squidward: Hm, turn away from me, huh? We'll just see. [checks his watch] Oh, it's past 8:00. Where is SpongeBob?
[Just then, SpongeBob bursts through the door, now in a cool tuxedo, awesome shades, and a wicked hairdo. A cold breeze freezes the patrons inside as they gasp in awe at SpongeBob.]
Cool SpongeBob/CoolBob SmoothPants: Hey, cool crowd. What's shaking? Oh, yeah. [enters the lounge] Hey, hipsters. It's groovy, cats. Oh, I can dig it.
[One patron squeals happily and melts. SpongeBob slides across the floor just as the lounge's Maître D' shows up.]
Maître D': Oh, welcome, man. You're the coolest customer we've ever had.
Cool SpongeBob: Oh, crazy, Daddy. Crazy. [pinches his cheek]
Maître D': Can I seat you at the coolest table? [points to the coolest table with all the cool people in it]
Cool SpongeBob: No, thank you. I'm here to meet up with a real cool cat. Oh, there he is. Hey, Squideroonie!
[Squidward struggles to get his foot out of the chair, but falls over.]
Maître D': [deeply shocked] You're with him?
Squidward: [crawls over to SpongeBob] Yes, he’s with me. And he is my—best... [twitches his eye and struggles to say ""friend""] friend...
Cool SpongeBob: You heard the man, folks. He's my best friend. Can you dig it? [snaps his fingers]
Maître D': [confused] Huh?
[Everyone snaps their fingers.]
Maître D': I guess he's...cool? [sees Squidward's ugly-looking face; donkey braying sound is heard]
Cool Patron #2: I don't know, man. [sniffs Squidward's armpit] Something smells lame.
Squidward: [kicks the cool patron away] Hey, CoolBob, why don't you sing everybody one of your singing cool tunes?
Cool SpongeBob: Oh, no, Daddio. I really couldn't.
[Everyone snaps their fingers. Squidward takes SpongeBob to the stage, pushes the drummer aside, and gives him a microphone.]
Cool SpongeBob: Well, okay, maybe just one ditty. [tips his hairdo] Then I'll get out your hair.
Squidward: And I will accompany you on my licorice stick. [slips on the stage with his clarinet and talks quietly] Just as I planned. [laughs evilly]
[Squidward gets up and plays his clarinet. But his clarinet playing is way off-key and it deeply annoys the patrons. The Maître D' is also annoyed. The patrons boo at Squidward, but Squidward didn't seem to care. The Maître D' walks up to the stage and peaks out behind the curtains.]
Maître D': Would you care for a mute, sir? [holds up a cork] All the great jazz musicians use mutes.
Squidward: Hey, that's right, they do. Thanks, Daddio.
[The Maître D' plugs Squidward's clarinet with the cork.]
Cool SpongeBob: A-one, a-two, a bop-bubbly boo. [drinks some bubble soap and sings out some bubbles shaped like musical notes]
[The audience becomes fascinated with SpongeBob's singing. The entire lounge gets filled with musical note-shaped bubbles that it causes the roof to explode. Suddenly, the screw between SpongeBob's teeth becomes loose and separates back to normal. SpongeBob starts singing with his normal voice again. The audience are shocked and Squidward stops playing. Squidward gasps and thinks of a backup plan. He steals some dentures from another patron and shoves it in SpongeBob's mouth, making his voice sound deeper again. Then they proceed in their performance. The audience snap their fingers in an applause when the performance ended.]
Squidward: At last, I'm cool! Mwah! [blows a kiss and takes a bow with SpongeBob; the dentures fall out of SpongeBob's mouth and Squidward pushes SpongeBob off the stage] Go on, go on— [bumps into the Maître D'] That was so cool, it caused structural damage! [shakes SpongeBob's hand] You got to play some more for us cats. Don't leave us hanging.
SpongeBob: [regular voice] Oh, aren't you nice, I—
Squidward: [covers SpongeBob's mouth] Uh, sorry, man. We're going to bounce, you dig? [pushes SpongeBob to the door] Hey, we gotta go spread some more joy, baby. But we'll be back tomorrow night to blow the roof back on.
[Everyone cheers.]
SpongeBob: Yay—
[Squidward covers SpongeBob's mouth and leaves. The scene changes to the next day at the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Thank, Dr. Squidward. That was so much fun being ""cool"" for one night.
Squidward: [grins evilly] We are going to stay ""cool"" every night if it kills us! Got it, Daddio?
SpongeBob: Okay, best friend. [laughs]
[Squidward's eye twitches after SpongeBob said ""best friend."" Squidward pokes the eye from twitching, stopping it.]
Squidward: We just have to make sure that the gap in your teeth stays closed. [lowers a cement machine] Say cheese.
SpongeBob: Chee—
[Squidward pours cement onto SpongeBob. He hardens it and puts the hairdo on SpongeBob as the finishing touch.]
Squidward: You ready, Daddio?
Cool SpongeBob: [deeper voice] Baby, I was born ready. [spins the chair and sings in jazz]
[The scene changes back to the jazz club. SpongeBob and Squidward perform on stage again.]
Cool Patron #3: [licks his ice cream] Cool.
Patrick: [appears in the ice cream] Real cool.
Cool SpongeBob: This next one goes out to all the [the gaps separates again and he talks in regular voice again] ladies!
[Squidward cements SpongeBob's gap again.]
Cool SpongeBob: [talks in a deeper voice again] Take it, Squidward. [gives Squidward the microphone]
Squidward: I'm going to start this solo on a high note! [blows the cork out really hard on the clarinet and plays off-key music]
[The clarinet music was so obnoxious that is made everyone at the lounge cover their ears in annoyance. The cool patrons at the coolest table didn't like the music either as their shades crack and break. They each give Squidward a thumbs down.]
Cool Patron #2: I knew he smells lame. [claps his hands]
[The lounge's security guard grabs Squidward by the neck and throws him out, making him land in garbage. Squidward growls angrily and heads back into the lounge. He grows even more angry when SpongeBob's getting more attention than him. SpongeBob's cool singing became so popular that a seed of selfish and jealousy grew in Squidward like a poison. Squidward grabs a mallet and goes to physically harm SpongeBob.]
Squidward: [seething with rage] If I'm not allowed to be cool anymore, then neither is SpongeBob! [goes to attack SpongeBob, but gets lifted in the air by the note bubbles]
[The note bubbles lift him up really high above the stage until they pop. Squidward falls downward with several stage props and crashes onto the stage.]
Cool SpongeBob: [climbs on some note bubbles as he sings] Zoop, zop, zlim, zlam, jam! [crashes onto a bag of sand] Bam! [falls on the stage; another bag of sand hits Squidward; SpongeBob gets up and talks in his normal voice] Yeah, okay. [his gap cracks and becomes separated again; his wig falls off] Hey, my gap's back!
[The audience murmurs in confusion. Squidward pulls himself out of the hole on the stage.]
Squidward: [groans and shakes his head to pull himself together] You see?! He's not cool! He's square! He's a food-flipping fraud!
SpongeBob: [laughs nervously and whistles] Sorry. [gasps] Did you hear that?! My whistle is back, too! Who needs singing when you can whistle? [whistles]
[Squidward covers his ears and groans in annoyance.]
Cool Patrons: Ooh, yeah. [snaps their fingers]
Squidward: [confused] What—what's going on? Wh—why are you snapping? Stop snapping!
[But everyone ignores Squidward.]
Drummer: That's the most righteous sound I've ever heard, man. Follow the leader of cool! [bangs his head on the bongos, makes a gap in his teeth and whistles with SpongeBob]
[The other cool patrons do the same thing. They all bang their heads, make gaps in their teeth and whistle with SpongeBob.]
Squidward: [annoyed and infuriated] Hmm, you know what? If that is what passes for ""cool"" now, then I don't want to be cool anymore! Hmph!
[Squidward leaves the stage and heads to the door in disgust. But he bumps into the security guard.]
Squidward: Huh? [his teeth crack and make a gap]
[The security guard grabs Squidward real hard by the neck.]
Maître D': Oh, you're not leaving this time until you pay for the damages first, Daddio.
Squidward: [whistles] This stinks.",1.14,Doug Lawrence

He is wearing a Hawaiian shirt, has a suitcase in hand, and has an exterminator's fumigation tent covering his house. SpongeBob comes over and thinks that the tent is a circus tent, but Squidward angrily tells him otherwise, saying that the tent is for getting rid of sea urchins that have infested his house. It turns out this is because SpongeBob is responsible, due to feeding them popcorn. Patrick suddenly comes out of the tent, also thinking that his house is a circus, exclaiming that it was boring. He also thinks the cotton balls are candy and eats them. Annoyed by their stupidity, Squidward storms off and boards the arriving bus, and also tells SpongeBob and Patrick that he will be staying at a hotel for the next few days in order to have peace and quiet. After he leaves, SpongeBob and Patrick begin a conga with the sea urchins.In the next scene, Squidward arrives at the hotel, and meets the manager. After the manager cracks a couple jokes, much to Squidward's annoyance, Squidward gets his room key. Squidward is very delighted with his room, and decides to relax by taking a bath. While bathing, SpongeBob and Patrick are seen running through Squidward's room, and end up bumping into each other, excitedly exclaiming on how much they love playing ""Hotel Slam N' Run."" After they leave, Squidward comes out of the bathroom, knowing that he heard a noise, but soon brushes it off as him being ""not relaxed enough.""Soon after, Squidward decides to order room service for his hotel room, but SpongeBob and Patrick (who have their voices disguised), are on the other end. After hanging up the phone, the hotel manager comes back and thanks SpongeBob and Patrick for filling in for him on the phone, giving the two a treat as a reward. SpongeBob and Patrick arrive to Squidward's room on a cart, and are happy to see their friend. Squidward is not so happy though, and demands an explanation as to why SpongeBob and Patrick are also in the hotel. They explain that the hotel is hosting this year's annual Jellyfishing Convention, and that Squidward's hotel room is in-between both of theirs. When they ask Squidward to come to the convention with them, he naturally refuses as he is not interested. As SpongeBob and Patrick conga-line out of Squidward's room, Squidward boards up his room and yells for SpongeBob and Patrick to stay away from him and leave him alone. Later, Squidward tries to enjoy various activities in the hotel, such as the spa, gym, and pool areas, but SpongeBob and Patrick disobey his pleas and appear in each of his activities, annoying him by their presence. After Squidward leaves the pool area, he sees SpongeBob and Patrick in the hotel halls, and tries to escape them, only to see them at every single turn (with one exception, where he somehow sees Mrs. Puff when he turns around). SpongeBob and Patrick begin to corner Squidward as he backs up against a door and begs for SpongeBob and Patrick to leave him alone, but SpongeBob slyly warns that the door behind him leads to the Jellyfishing Convention. Soon enough, a couple of the attendees at the convention notice Squidward, and drag him inside, leaving SpongeBob and Patrick to follow, which was their plan all along.Everyone at the convention welcomes Squidward with open arms, but he hates it. Later, SpongeBob and Patrick notice Squidward hiding in the corner, and are happy that everyone seems to love him. Squidward is not happy though, saying that everyone loves him so much that they will not let him leave. A pair of fish confirm this, saying that they love Squidward, as both of them head into the restrooms while leaving their Jellyfish mascot costume behind. Squidward suddenly gets an idea; if he puts the costume on, he can leave the convention undetected. As he is doing so, an announcement is made at the convention, much to the excitement of the crowd: it's time for the annual Jellyfish mascot hunt! Squidward runs away in panic, and the crowd, including SpongeBob and Patrick, give chase through the halls of the hotel. Squidward soon notices there is a button inside the suit called ""The Zapper,"" which allows him to electrocute anything with the costume's tentacles. Squidward gets a kick out of this, and starts running back towards the crowd, gleefully zapping people left and right. He soon approaches the manager at his desk and zaps him too. Squidward then grabs the nearby phone and calls pest control, frantically telling them that the hotel has an infestation of jellyfish... fanatics. Exterminators arrive and cover the entire hotel with a fumigation tent, forcing all the attendees, including SpongeBob and Patrick, to evacuate in fright, and SpongeBob and Patrick question if Squidward made it out okay. The episode then cuts to inside the hotel, where Squidward is seen in his room, happily dancing while wearing a gas mask, as the episode ends.",Jolly Lodgers,"[The episode begins with a view of Conch Street. Squidward is outside where his house has a tent over it. SpongeBob peeks out of his window and notices Squidward's house.]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy, a circus! [comes out of his house with popcorn and balloons] Squidward! You didn't tell me the circus is in town. [gasps] And it's in your house!
[SpongeBob gets excited and laughs.]
Squidward: Oh, good grief. [pulls out a pin and pops SpongeBob's balloons] It's not a circus, you clown! It's an exterminator's fumigation-disinfestation tent. [breezes are heard in Squidward's house] Somebody's been feeding sea urchins in this neighborhood, and they invested my house.
[SpongeBob is shown feeding sea urchins popcorn. It turns out SpongeBob was the one who was feeding sea urchins around Conch Street. SpongeBob nervously drops his popcorn and kicks the sea urchins away.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Ohh, uh, what's that up there?
[Someone or something comes out of Squidward's house revealing Patrick.]
Patrick: Squidward's circus is boring! And, and the cotton candy is stale. [pulls up a bag of cotton balls]
[Patrick opens the bag of cotton balls and puts them in his mouth, then starts chewing on them until he swallows them. Squidward becomes angry at Patrick.]
Squidward: It's not a circus and that's not cotton candy. D'oh! Never mind! [grabs his bag and starts leaving]
SpongeBob: Squidward, are you going somewhere?
Squidward: I'll be staying at a hotel for the next few days for peace and quiet.
[Squidward enters the bus and the bus takes drives off.]
SpongeBob: Goodbye!
Patrick: Bye bye!
SpongeBob: Seasons greetings!
[The sea urchins are doing the conga out of Squidward's house to SpongeBob's and Patrick's houses. SpongeBob and Patrick join them to the direction where they're houses are at. Meanwhile, Squidward has arrived at the Hotel Halibut. Squidward rings the bell four times until the manager comes.]
Boat salesperson: Yes?
Squidward: Uh, are you the manager?
Boat salesperson: No! I just play one on TV. [sprays his mouth]
Squidward: I'd like a room.
Boat salesperson: Well, lucky you! [looks at his book] We have one room left, but I just gave it away.
Squidward: Well, how does that make me lucky?
Boat salesperson: Because I just gave it to you! [He gives Squidward the keys to his room. Squidward grabs his big and leaves to his room.] Would you like a bell boy? [Squidward quickly comes back happily.]
Squidward: Why, yes. Thank you.
Boat salesperson: [hands him the bell] Here's your bell, boy. [rings the bell and laughs]
[Squidward becomes annoyed at his joke. Once again, he grabs his bag and heads to his room. He opens the door.]
Squidward: Well, now this is very nice indeed [begins the relax on his bed until he melts on the bed to the bathroom tub] Mmm... This is Heaven. [All of a sudden, SpongeBob enters Squidward's room, starts laughing, and exits out.] Hello? [peeks out] Anyone there? Hello? [Squidward shrugs it off and continues relaxing. He then drowns into the tub. Suddenly, Patrick comes from the other side to enter Squidward's room, starts laughing, and exits out.] Hello? Did someone just come in? [Both SpongeBob and Patrick enter Squidward's room until they bump into each other.]
SpongeBob: Don't you just love playing Hotel: Slam and Run?
Patrick: I enjoy it an... [puts his tooth back into his mouth] ...intellectual challenge.
[SpongeBob and Patrick stands up, starts laughing, and both run out of Squidward's room. Squidward peeks from the bathroom with a robe on and a towel on his head.]
Squidward: Alright, I know I heard something in here! Ohh... [rubs his eyes.] Maybe I'm just not relaxed enough.
[Bubble transition to Squidward on his bed and smacking his lips. He then sits up and picks up the telephone. Cut to the hotel lobby, SpongeBob, who is now dressed as a hotel worker along with Patrick, answers the phone.]
SpongeBob: [holding his nose] Room service.
Squidward: Yes, hello. Do you have the blue plate special of the day?
SpongeBob: Blue plate? Yes, we have that. [Patrick is seen painting the plates blue.] Sir, all our plates are blue. [giggles]
Squidward: Then I'll have that.
[SpongeBob hangs up the phone.]
Boat salesperson: Oh, boys?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yes?
Boat salesperson: Thanks for filling in the phone. You may take the order up to the room now. [hands them a treat] Here's your reward.
[SpongeBob and Patrick make sea otter noises. Cut to Squidward's room, Squidward is reading a book until his door knocks.]
SpongeBob: [offscreen] Room service.
Squidward: Come in.
[SpongeBob and Patrick come in to Squidward's room until they land onto Squidward's bed. Sponge Monger music starts playing.]
SpongeBob: Squidward? What a happy surprise.
Patrick: SpongeBob, aren't you gonna introduce me?
SpongeBob: Oh, it's Squidward, Patrick. Our next door neighbor and best friend.
Patrick: [crosses his arms] Well, if you say so.
[Squidward growls angrily and pushes SpongeBob and Patrick off of his bed.]
Squidward: Get off me! What are you doing in this hotel?
SpongeBob: [puts his his jellyfish hat along with Patrick] Huh, this hotel is hosting the annual Jellyfishing Convention.
[We cut to out side where a sign reads ""Welcome Jelly-Con.""]
Squidward: Jellyfishing Convention?
SpongeBob: Yes, and my room is over there. [points to his room]
[The camera scrolls over to the door that leads to SpongeBob's room.]
Patrick: And that's my room in there!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward's in the middle! Squidward's in the middle! [They laugh as they hop off of Squidward's bed and start doing the conga.] Squidward's in the middle! Squidward's in the middle! Squidward's in the middle! [leaves and closes the door]
[Squidward grabs a hammer and boards and starts hammering SpongeBob and Patrick's doors. Suddenly, he hears SpongeBob, Patrick, and the jellyfishing visitors start chanting the same thing.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Jellyfishing Visitors: Squidward's in the middle! Squidward's in the middle! Squidward's in the middle! Squidward's in the middle!
Squidward: You stay away from me! I don't wanna see either of you in any part of this hotel! [groans in sadness and leans against the door] I used to love the conga. [Bubble transition to the Hotel Spa.] [sighs] The Hotel Spa. [The massager massages Squidward as Squidward relaxes.] Mmm, this massage feels great. You have magic fingers.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [with stick hands with gloves on them] Squidward! Magic fingers!
Squidward: No! Stay away from me! [Squidward uses the table to escape SpongeBob and Patrick.]
SpongeBob: [shrugs] Huh. [he and Patrick scratch themselves] Oh, we really do have magic fingers.
[Transition to the hotel workout room where Squidward is stretching.]
Squidward: Oh yes, I still got a dancer's body. One. Two. One. Two. Hmm?
[SpongeBob and Patrick come to Squidward with a treadmill.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward!
Squidward: [jumps on a barbell] Stay away from me. [leaves with the barbell]
SpongeBob: Heave!
Patrick: Oh!
SpongeBob: Heave!
[Bubble transition to the hotel swimming pool. Squidward is hiding behind a plant and peeks through it to see if the cost is clear.]
Squidward: No SpongeBob? [peeks under the floorboard] No Patrick? [sighs] Ah, peace and quiet...
[Squidward takes off his glasses and heads towards the pool. He jumps on the diving board to jump in. But the pool starts bubbling and Squidward immediately runs back to the diving board. SpongeBob and Patrick pop out from the pool.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward!
Squidward: [jumps on the diving board] Leave! Me! Alone!
SpongeBob: Heave!
Patrick: Heave! [drowns back into the water]
Squidward: [jumps into the hallway, then stands up] Finally. [As Squidward was about to be alone, he spots SpongeBob and Patrick in the distance. The camera zooms in on SpongeBob and Patrick. Squidward quickly runs away from SpongeBob and Patrick to the next hall.] [""Grass Skirt Chase"" music starts playing.] [Squidward stops and notices SpongeBob and Patrick at the end.] [screaming] [Squidward then runs back, but bumps into SpongeBob and Patrick again. His eyes open wide.] [screaming] [He runs back, then bumps into SpongeBob and Patrick yet again. His eyes come out of his sockets.] [screaming] [Again, he runs and bumps into them again. His eyes comes out of his mouth. He then runs back, but instead of SpongeBob and Patrick, it was Mrs. Puff. Squidward forms into four heads as he sees her.] [screaming] [He runs back with SpongeBob and Patrick again. Squidward thought he saw Mrs. Puff, then runs back.] Huh... humph. That's better. [But it was SpongeBob and Patrick again.] [screaming] [backs up a bit to the door] Stay away from me! I'm warning you! I wanna be alone! [shivers]
SpongeBob: [looks at Patrick] Ooh. Well, if you wanna be alone, don't go into the room behind you.
Squidward: [looks at the door] Wait, are you two in there already?
SpongeBob: No, silly. [he and Patrick pull out their jellyfishing Equipment] That's where the Jellyfishing Convention is!
[The door behind Squidward opens. A Geek appears.]
Geek: Welcome, Jelly Fisher. You must be a newbie. [Grabs and pulls him in.]
Squidward: Huh? [stammers] [He tries to grip the floor with his tentacles and his teeth on the other door. But is pulled in.]
Geek: [Holding a net] Jelly Fishing! Woo-hoo! [He follows Squidward. Patrick and SpongeBob do the same while cheering.]
[Inside the 36th Annual Jelly-fisher Convention building, Squidward is dragged in to one of the Geek's friends. He is donned a pink uniform T-shirt, which gets stuck on his head. He grunts and strains until the shirt goes on and fits him. The friend squeezes him tight.]
Geek: Welcome, newbie.
Squidward: [Takes one look at the jellyfish] [screams] [And runs into another geek, who dons him a pink squid-shaped hat. He is squeezed tight.]
Geek: Jelly hug.
[Squidward yells and runs. He slips over a hat and lands sat up on a chair, where another geek is painting a portrait of him catching a geek.]
Squidward: Hm? [anguished] Nooooo!
Geeks: [Altogether while the horde surrounds him.] Jelly fishing! Jelly fishing! Jelly fishing!
[Jellyfish transition. Squidward is sitting behind one of the stalls shaking with fear. Patrick is enjoying an ice-cream, while SpongeBob gasps as he suddenly spots Squidward.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Over his face] Hi, Squidward !
SpongeBob: Squidward, everyone loves you! Are you having the funnest fun fun fun time ever?
Squidward: [Gets up quickly and grunts in anger.] I am not having fun. Everybody loves me so much, they won't let me [At their faces] leave!
Geek: [Off screen] Hey, Squidward, [On screen, reveals himself from under a large squid-shaped hat.] we love you, man.
Female geek: You belong with us now.
[The Female geek goes in one of the rooms, followed by the male geek, who puts the large hat down and goes in another room. The camera closes in on the hat.]
Squidward: [A lightbulb appears and shines above his head, knocking the cap off, implying he has an idea] Say, if I put that dumb thing on, I can sneak out of here without anybody knowing it's me. [He hides inside the oversized hat and pushes it.] [chuckles] Goodbye, jelly-smellies. I'm outta here, and back to peace and quiet in my room.
[People are gathered outside the stage. The large hat cuts across the crowd and shoves everyone out of the way as it goes by. An incidental appears on stage, holding a microphone.]
Incidental: Alright, jellyfishers, it's the moment you've all been waiting for! [Patrick and SpongeBob rise up in the crowd and clap and cheer with excitement.] Let the annual Jellyfish Mascot Hunt begin!
[The crowd and cheer and hold their nets up high. Squidward stops while he tries to escape and starts sweating inside.]
Squidward: Jellyfish Mascot Hunt? [He looks inside one of the windows. Everyone gives chase to him, causing him to yell and run away. He tries to escape through the door, but the mascot gets wedged for a brief moment before getting through, with the others following. Squidward runs as fast as he can, but soon notices a set of controls.] Huh? What's this? [The controls are revealed to be the Zapper] Zapper?! [He presses one of the buttons.]
Geek: Whoop, whoop! [The mascot's tentacle zaps him] [screams] [And blows him to the back of the chasing pack, roasted.]
Blue geek: Zap me! [Is zapped and burned.]
Squidward: [laughs] Zapper.
[While the clamoring and chasing continues, Squidward brakes to a halt and runs in the opposite direction with all zappers activated. It zaps and takes down people continuously.]
Geeks: [In unison] Zap me! [they scream and get zapped.]
[The mascot flips over and zaps two more geeks on the opposite side, followed by one more geek. It then spins mid-air and malfunctions. The electric conductors now touch the floor and unleash a powerful electric current.]
Patrick and SpongeBob: [excitedly] Oh, boy! [The current zaps them both, and then everybody in the hallway, blowing them back. Squidward stops and runs...]
Squidward: [laughs] [...to the Boat salesperson and zaps him, burning him to a crisp and getting blown back. He then picks up the phone.] Hello, pest control? I'm calling from the Hotel Halibut. We've got a horrible infestation of jellyfish... [annoyed] fanatics.
Geeks: [Crawling while burned] More zaps. Zap me.
Squidward: Send exterminators now !
[Exterminators - Police vans on boats - arrive outside the hotel. Dramatic music plays as two more exterminators cover the building with a large blanket. One puts a hose into the pump and pumps it with toxic gas, forcing everyone to yell and evacuate. Meanwhile, Patrick is with SpongeBob enjoying an ice cream.]
SpongeBob: I sure hope Squidward got out okay.
Patrick: Squidward? [Shrugs] You must introduce me some day.
SpongeBob: Hm?
[The camera cuts to inside the hotel. The hallway is covered in gas, but all the doors are closed.]
Squidward: [Singing] I've got peace and qui-et! [He is revealed to be inside a gassed bedroom wearing a protective mask, dancing] I've got peace and qui-et! Whoo. I've got peace and qui-et!",0.80,Kaz

Rosy arrives early to send her triplet daughters to their aunt, as she wants to relax back up on the surface, despite Sandy not having finished making their present. SpongeBob tells Sandy he will take care of the triplets. But when Sandy tries to warn SpongeBob about them, he cuts her off, as he thinks he can babysit. SpongeBob starts taking care of them, but his techniques do not work on them. After SpongeBob has a wrassle match with them that causes severe damage to his hands, Sandy tells SpongeBob he should take the triplets around town.SpongeBob takes the triplets to his work station, as he thinks it is the most fun place in Bikini Bottom. The triplets play around in there for a while, but when Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob he should babysit off Krusty Krab property, the triplets tell SpongeBob to take them somewhere else or he will have to taste Texas pain. SpongeBob decides to take them to Goo Lagoon, but they end up trapping him inside a sandcastle made of concrete and smash him with a wrecking ball to get him out, causing a tall bump to appear on his head.SpongeBob takes them to his house, where Patrick is shown to be dazed as he needs to turn on SpongeBob's television. When SpongeBob turns it on, a TV show about a squirrel puppet is on, making Patrick and the nieces excited, as they love the show. However, the triplets are blocking Patrick's view, so he goes around them to get a better view of the show. This leads to them and Patrick battling to try and watch the TV show. Eventually, they want to settle everything with a wrassle match, which Patrick wins due to being excited about seeing a brownie on the table. The triplets get sad and run back to their maternal aunt, who just got their present ready that she was making from the beginning, which is a bouncy house. Sandy tells SpongeBob the one rule about babysitting her nieces is to not do it in the first place. The episode ends with Sandy sending the triplets back to their mother, much to her dismay.",Sandy's Nutty Nieces,"[The episode begins with Sandy working on her latest invention in her treedome. SpongeBob, who appears to have a silly look on his face, is helping.]
Sandy: Laser wrench.
SpongeBob: Mm-hmm. [hands her a hammer]
Sandy: Nope.
SpongeBob: Ah. [hands her a screwdriver]
Sandy: Uh-uh.
SpongeBob: Mm? [hands her a pair of underwear]
Sandy: Not even close.
SpongeBob: [laughs as he paddles Sandy's head with a paddle ball]
Sandy: No. No. No.
SpongeBob: Oh! [honks a horn in Sandy's face]
Sandy: [grabs the horn] Ugh, fine! It'll do. [screams the horn on her invention]
[The doorbell rings.]
Sandy: Hm?
SpongeBob: I'll get it! [answers the door and another squirrel comes in]
Rosy Cheeks: Surprise! [removes her diving helmet and her three children enter the treedome] Hi-ya, sis!
Macadamia: [removes her diving helmet] Howdy!
Hazelnut: [removes her diving helmet] Auntie!
Pistachio: [removes her diving helmet] Sandy!
Sandy: Oh! I didn't expect y'all till tomorrow.
Rosy Cheeks: I know how much you love your nieces y'know, so I brought 'em a day early.
Sandy: SpongeBob, this here's my sister, Rosy and my three nieces. [points to her niece in a red dress] This'n here's Macadamia.
Macadamia: [curtsy] How do?
Sandy: [points to her niece in a yellow dress] Hazelnut.
Hazelnut: [twirls around and curtsy] How do?
Sandy: [points to her niece in a green dress] And little Pistachio.
Pistachio: How d— [belches and giggles in embarrassment]
Sandy: Girls, this is my friend, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Aww, what sweet little angels!
Rosy Cheeks: [laughs nervously] Yeah, angels. Okay, well I gotta skedaddle. [puts her diving helmet back on, exits the treedome, inflates her suit, and floats to the surface] Freedom!
Sandy: [talks quietly to SpongeBob] Doggone it. They're too early! I'm not finished with their present!
SpongeBob: [puts on a cowboy hat and a fake mustache] Don't worry your pretty little head, little lady. I'll watch the gals ‘til you're done!
Sandy: [removes SpongeBob's hat and fake mustache] Thanks, SpongeBob, but there's something I gotta tell you about babysitting my—
SpongeBob: [closes Sandy's mouth and chuckles] Yeah, I think I know a little something about babysitting, Sandy.
[A flashback shows SpongeBob babysitting Patrick in his pineapple house. SpongeBob pats Patrick on the back like a baby and Patrick belches. Back in reality, SpongeBob makes hand motions and belches like Patrick.]
SpongeBob: [shrugs in embarrassment] Excuse me.
Sandy: Y'all mind your Uncle SpongeBob now. [takes her invention and heads into her tree]
SpongeBob: [pulls up the picnic table, scoops up the three nieces and sits them down] Story time! [blows up an inflatable book and begins to read it] Goldyfish and the Three Sea Bears. Chapter one, breaking and entering.
Macadamia: [pops the inflatable book with a needle and pouts] Don't waste your breath...
Hazelnut: [pouts] And don't make a hassle...
Pistachio: [pouts] Some kids like to read...
Macadamia, Hazelnut, and Pistachio: But we'd rather wrassle!
TV Announcer: Wrassle match!
SpongeBob: Now you girls go easy on me, okay? [giggles]
Macadamia: [arm wrestles SpongeBob and flips him over] One!
[SpongeBob gets up and goes to arm wrestle Hazelnut.]
Hazelnut: [arm wrestles SpongeBob and crushes his hand] Two!
[SpongeBob's hand and fingers is crumbled into dust. SpongeBob waters his hand and it replenishes back to normal. SpongeBob then goes to arm wrestle Pistachio, but she was too strong for him to handle. Pistachio yawns in boredom. She knocks him upward and shatters the picnic table. She throws his severed arm and SpongeBob crashes into Sandy's tree.]
SpongeBob: Ow!
Sandy: [comes out of the tree when she heard the ruckus and shakes her head] Ugh. [picks SpongeBob up and puts him back together as she walks him to the door] Why don't ya show the girls around town?
SpongeBob: Great idea! [places bubbles on their heads so they have enough air to breathe] I'll take them to the funnest place in all of Bikini Bottom!
[The girls merge together and form a huge smile. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab and the girls smile turns into a frown.]
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab! [the girls detach themselves and Mr. Krabs comes in] Mr. Krabs, these are Sandy's little nieces.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, nieces, eh? And what brings such cute little customers to Bikini Bottom?
Macadamia: We're visiting Auntie Sandy…
Hazelnut: And we want to sling hash...
Pistachio: A chophouse like this must be...
Macadamia, Hazelnut, and Pistachio: [their eyes have dollar signs on them] Loaded with cash!
Mr. Krabs: [giggles, then blushes] Aww! Go on! No, really. Go on.
[Mr. Krabs and the girls stare for a while until they turn and head to the register. Pistachio gives Mr. Krabs a death ray, saying that she's watching him. Squidward is knitting a beautiful sweater for himself at the register.]
SpongeBob: [sneaks up behind Squidward and accidentally causes him to tear his sweater apart] This is my coworker/best buddy, Squidward.
Squidward: Ugh! Children.
Macadamia: Ugh! Grown-ups.
Hazelnut: This feller ain't happy.
Pistachio: Just look at his face.
[Squidward's face appears ugly looking, with a foghorn blaring.]
Macadamia, Hazelnut, and Pistachio: We're gonna be sick all over the place!
[Squidward groans. Bubble transition to SpongeBob making a meal for the girls in the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: Here you go! Three Dolly Patties.
[Hazelnut sprays ketchup into SpongeBob's face to make him look like Mr. Krabs.]
SpongeBob: [imitates Mr. Krabs]
[Hazelnut sprays relish, ketchup and mustard all over the kitchen.]
Squidward: Can you stop playing dress-up long enough to make some Krabby Patties?
[The girls spray mustard into Squidward's face to make him look like SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Huh! Guess that's me all over. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: [comes in the kitchen and laughs] You two look ridiculerous!
[The girls spray ketchup, mustard and relish on Mr. Krabs to make him look like Plankton.]
Squidward: Ha! You're your own worst enemy.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, from now on, babysit off Krusty Krab Property! [SpongeBob backs away in embarrassment] And Mr. Squidward, dress like SpongeBob on your own time.
[SpongeBob and the girls exit the restaurant.]
Macadamia: That place really stunk.
Hazelnut: It was lamer than lame.
Pistachio: Take us somewhere fun.
Macadamia, Hazelnut, and Pistachio: [holds up brass knuckles with spikes on them] Or taste Texas pain!
SpongeBob: Aww, what cute little knuckles you have. Hmm, hmm... ooh, I've got just the spot.
[Bubble transition to Goo Lagoon. SpongeBob and the girls are in bathing suits.]
SpongeBob: [inhales] Ahh, smell that fresh seawater.
[Macadamia taps on the bubble to remind SpongeBob they can't smell through it.]
SpongeBob: Oh, heh-hey, right. Sorry.
[SpongeBob throws the blankets in the air and it magically flips onto the girls. The umbrella lands next to SpongeBob along with the picnic basket and sand bucket. The girls layback and relax in the sun.]
SpongeBob: [yawns] See, Sandy, nothing to worry about. Baby-sitting is eaaaaasy. [falls fast asleep]
[Moments later...]
Macadamia: Hey, Uncle SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Huh? [blinks his eyes]
Hazelnut: Open your eyes!
[SpongeBob blinks his eyes.]
Pistachio: You're just gonna love...
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Hm? [sees a sandcastle built over him]
Macadamia, Hazelnut, and Pistachio: Our sandy surprise!
Macadamia: It's our gift to you!
SpongeBob: Well, isn't that sweet!
Hazelnut: And it won't wash away...!
Pistachio: [holds up a trowel] 'Cause it's made of concrete!
SpongeBob: Concrete, what?! [gets up] Good structural integrity girls, but a little tight!
Macadamia: So, sorry, Uncle.
Hazelnut: We made it too small...
Pistachio: But we'll get you out...
Macadamia, Hazelnut, and Pistachio: With this wrecking ball!
SpongeBob: [Scared] Wrecking what?!
[Pistachio bashes SpongeBob in the head a couple of times, giving him a really long bump on his head. The bump reaches the surface next to Bikini Atoll. A seagull lands on top of the bump. SpongeBob pulls himself out of the sand.]
SpongeBob: [dizzy] Let's all go to my house and take a little break. [moans and walks away with the girls]
[The scene changes to the girls skipping around SpongeBob tying his bump with ribbons.]
SpongeBob: Here we are, girls. Pineapple, sweet pine— [opens the door and Patrick with a horrible look on his face as if he didn't sleep for weeks] Whoa!
Patrick: I've been waiting all day to watch your TV! [backs up inside as his face gets eerie]
[SpongeBob and the girls enter the house.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you could have watched it while I was out.
Patrick: I forgot how to make it work! [shakes SpongeBob's television] Show me! Show me funny! I wanna see stories! Go, go! [sobs] Please!
SpongeBob: [turns the television on] Boop. There you go.
[The television shows a funny black and white comedy show.]
Patrick: [rubs his head and stupidly] I don't know how you remember all this technical stuff.
SpongeBob: Yeah. Patrick, meet Sandy's nieces.
Patrick: [flies over to SpongeBob's chair] Good to meet ya! [sits on the chair]
[A squirrel hand puppet is shown.]
Squirrel hand puppet: [on TV] Hey, kids, know what time it is? [smashes an acorn] It's nutcrackin' time!
Patrick: [giggles] I love this episode!
Macadamia: Well, well, what do you know?
Macadamia, Hazelnut, and Pistachio: Patrick is watching our favorite show!
[The girls move over to the television so they can watch it.]
SpongeBob: Ah, finally, I can relax. [holds up a mixer in the kitchen] With work!
[SpongeBob turns on the mixer and starts to make a batter for his brownies. The batter splatters all over the kitchen. SpongeBob licks the batter from his eyes and body. Back in the living room, Patrick is having a hard time seeing the show due to the girls blocking the view. He huffs in anger. He gets up from the chair to see the show. But Pistachio's tail blocks his face. He moves himself and the chair in front so he can see.]
Patrick: Ah, that's better.
[The girls growl angrily. They move themselves in front of Patrick and stack each other up.]
Patrick: [angrily] Aww!
[Patrick hops his chair in front of the girls. He laughs at the show. The girls climb onto Patrick so they can see the television. Patrick growls angrily and activates the chair's lever to get the girls off. He snickers evilly and scoots himself in front of the television.]
Macadamia: Let's launch this goof...
Macadamia, Hazelnut, and Pistachio: Right to the roof!
Macadamia: [chuckles as she grabs the chair's lever] Lift-off!
[Macadamia launches Patrick upwards and the girls laugh.]
Patrick: [flies through the roof] Whoo! [falls back down] Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: [comes in with a plate full of brownies] Who wants brownies? [Patrick falls on SpongeBob and eats the brownies before bouncing backwards] Heh. I'll go make another batch.
[The girls laugh at the show before Patrick falls back onto the chair.]
Macadamia: Let's send this nitwit...
Hazelnut: On his way!
Pistachio: Before he ruins our whole dern day!
Macadamia: [holds up a hangman's noose] Yeah!
[The girls merge together and form a huge evil smile. The scene changes Pistachio tying a rope to the end of the bus.]
Bus driver: All aboard for Glove World!
[Macadamia ties the rope to Patrick and the chair. The bus begins to drive away and drags Patrick with the chair.]
Patrick: Save me a brownie!
Macadamia: He'll be away...
Macadamia, Hazelnut, and Pistachio: The whole dern day!
[The girls fistbump and proceed to watch television. But much to their misfortune, Patrick returns with a group of people wearing gloves on their heads.]
Patrick: Hi! I brought some friends.
[Patrick and everyone else enter the house and move in front of the television, blocking the girls' view once again. SpongeBob comes back in with a new batch of brownies.]
SpongeBob: [sees more people in his house] Ooh! I'll have to make more brownies! [goes back in the kitchen]
Macadamia: [fed up with Patrick's stupidity and selfishness] All y'all shoo! You're blocking our view!
Bikini Bottomites: [nervously back away] Excuse us. Sorry. Sorry, ma'am.
Hazelnut: We're taking that seat...
Pistachio: Right where you sit!
Patrick: What you gonna do?
Macadamia, Hazelnut, and Pistachio: Let's wrassle for it!
TV Announcer: Wrassle match!
SpongeBob: [as the referee] Ready, set...wrassle!
[The bell rings. Patrick and the girls struggle with all their might. They both look as they were equally matched due to their strength. But just as the girls were about to win, Patrick spots a brownie on the table.]
Patrick: Ooh, brownie! [slaps the girls' hands down on the table, which inexplicably helps him win the match]
Macadamia, Hazelnut, and Pistachio: Huh?
Patrick: You saved me one! Thanks! [eats the brownie] Guess I get the TV. [chuckles evilly]
Macadamia: That guy's mean!
Hazelnut: Where's our auntie?!
Pistachio: We gon' leave!
Macadamia, Hazelnut, and Pistachio: [tears fill up their bubbles as they cry] We want Sandy!
[The girls run back to Sandy's treedome, crying their eyes out.]
Macadamia: Oh, Auntie Sandy, what a terrible place!
Hazelnut: Everyone was so mean!
Pistachio: Right to our face!
Sandy: [sympathetically] Aw, don't fret, little ladies. I made a present just for you, [pops Macadamia's bubble] you, [pops Hazelnut's bubble] and you. [pops Pistachio's bubble]
[Sandy pushes the button on the invention she was working on and it forms into a castle-shaped bouncing house.]
Macadamia: From a rattlesnake's tail...
Hazelnut: To an armadillo's chest...
Pistachio: Our Auntie Sandy...
Macadamia, Hazelnut, and Pistachio: Is the gol'durn best!
[The girls go and play on the bounce house just as SpongeBob enters the treedome without his water helmet.]
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, Sandy. [begins to dry up due to not wearing a water helmet] I guess I'm just not a very good babysitter.
Sandy: [puts a water helmet on SpongeBob] I tried to tell ya the first rule of babysitting my nieces.
SpongeBob: What's that?
Sandy: Don't babysit my nieces!
[SpongeBob smiles in embarrassment, since he should have listened to Sandy in the first place. Sandy pushes another button and turns the bounce house into an inflatable submarine, trapping the girls inside.]
Macadamia, Hazelnut, and Pistachio: Bye, Auntie Sandy! Bye, Uncle SpongeBob!
[The submarine exits the treedome and floats away to the surface. SpongeBob and Sandy wave goodbye. But despite everything SpongeBob went through with them, his eyes teared up as he smiles happily.]
Sandy: Bye-bye! Have a nice trip back to Texas! [quietly whispers to SpongeBob] Bless their evil little hearts.
[Back in Texas, Rosy is submerged in a pool relaxing as she is enjoying her time off from her children.]
Rosy Cheeks: Ahhh... [the submarine's shadow looms over her; she gasps] Oh, no.
[The submarine crashes on top of Rosy and her children are happily bouncing up and down in front of her.]
Macadamia, Hazelnut, and Pistachio: Hiya, Ma! Did ya miss us?
Rosy: [groans] No, I didn’t.",0.94,Luke Brookshier

Mr. Krabs suggests that SpongeBob is dead, so he, Squidward, and the customers decide to go into his house and check it out. It turns out that SpongeBob was sleeping because his alarm clock was not plugged in, causing him to sleep late. When SpongeBob tries to turn it on, it is too heavy and topples over, causing it to bounce around, and eventually break into pieces. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to get a new clock, but SpongeBob would not because he and the clock have through so much together (In other words, SpongeBob has had his foghorn alarm clock for years and built up good will with it).At first, SpongeBob tries to fix it, but Patrick, trying to help his friend, breaks it completely, forcing SpongeBob to buy another one at the alarm clock store. In the store, the seller tells SpongeBob that his alarms are no longer being produced, so SpongeBob decides to buy the whole store in order to choose a suitable alarm clock from the set.However, not one of the alarms can wake SpongeBob, making him late for work every time. This forces Mr. Krabs to tell SpongeBob that if he is late again, he will fire him and hire another chef. At home, SpongeBob invents and creates a mechanism that will prevent him from being late for work, and as a plus, he will be able to sleep while this mechanism makes Krabby Patties. However, the mechanism breaks when Bubble Bass returns his order due to not having extra pickles, but Mr. Krabs does not fire SpongeBob, he warns if he does not show up, he will have to open and close the Krusty Krab an hour later, something SpongeBob overreacts to. At the same moment, Patrick brings SpongeBob his old alarm clock. However, it still does not work properly, so Patrick has to imitate the noise of the alarm to wake up SpongeBob every morning.",Broken Alarm,"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. The customers are running wild with hunger and are gnawing everything in sight. A barrel crashes onto Mr. Krabs' office door.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward! [dodges an incoming axe] What is happening in me restaurant?!
Squidward: The customers have gone crazy! [screams as Monroe was thrown in the kitchen] SpongeBob is late for work, so there's no food!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps then grabs and shakes Squidward] But he's never been late for work in his life! Oh, this can only mean one thing. [hops on a table and rings the bell] SpongeBob has passed away!
[The customers pause for a moment and cry.]
Mr. Krabs: Or...maybe he's just seriously injured. [chuckles]
[The customers cry once more.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah, that's still bad, isn't it? [sobs along with the customers]
Squidward: [files his tentacle] I had no idea you cared that much about SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs Squidward] Of course! He's been a loyal employee. His passing would be a great loss to me bank account. Oh, I—to me personally, of course. Now, come on, we have to go check on SpongeBob's possible remains.
Squidward: With pleasure! [smiles sadistically; but Mr. Krabs stares angrily at him] What? Too soon?
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob's pineapple. The sky is gray and the scenery looks gloomy. Mr. Krabs, Squidward, and the customers are outside SpongeBob's bedroom door.]
Mr. Krabs: Prepare yourselves for the horror. [the customers quiver, but Squidward gives a sadistic smile] Or the joy. Let's not be downers about this.
Bikini Bottomites: Oh, yeah. Okay.
Mr. Krabs: But probably, like I said, the horror!
[The customers gasp while Squidward grins maliciously. Mr. Krabs peeks in through the bedroom door. Inside, SpongeBob is still in bed with Gary sleeping on him. Gary is licking SpongeBob to get him to wake up.]
Mr. Krabs: Neptune's nightmare! That snail is eating SpongeBob's face! [rushes over to SpongeBob's bed and grabs Gary] Get away from him! [pulls Gary off of SpongeBob]
Bikini Bottomites: [overlapping chatter] Such a nice kid.
SpongeBob: [wakes up] I—I— [babbles and shakes his head before the lights turn on] Oh, good morning, everyone.
[Everyone gives SpongeBob disappointed looks and they all walk out. Mr. Krabs and Squidward stay behind to talk to SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: [picks up SpongeBob] SpongeBob, you're alive!
SpongeBob: I am? Well, thank goodness. Wait, why wouldn't I be alive?
Mr. Krabs: [sets SpongeBob down] You were late to work, so we assumed the worst.
Squidward: [rolls his eyes in annoyance] You mean, ""the best.""
SpongeBob: Late to work? But that's impossible! My trusty alarm clock always waked me up. [holds up his alarm clock] See? [sees it unplugged] Well, how do you like that? It's unplugged. Well, we'll just fix that and I'll never be late again.
[SpongeBob goes to plug his alarm clock back in. But the alarm clock falls over and goes bouncing around the bedroom. SpongeBob hides under the covers to prevent himself from getting hit. The alarm clock bounces back from the bed and flies under Squidward. The alarm clock bounces back from a wall and hits Squidward in the back of his head, breaking it into bits of pieces.]
SpongeBob: [catches Gary] Oh, my clock!
[Squidward and Mr. Krabs stand up and see pieces of the alarm clock everywhere. The blowhorn part of the alarm clock is stuck through Squidward's neck. Squidward falls over and the blowhorn breaks.]
Mr. Krabs: Looks like you need a new clock, boy-o.
SpongeBob: Oh, I could never replace my old clock, Mr. Krabs. We've been through a lot together. [hugs the remains of his alarm clock] It's the only alarm clock I've ever owned. I can fix it.
Mr. Krabs: Eh, good luck. But you better not be late tomorrow. [leans in closer to SpongeBob's face] Or else.
Squidward: [rubs his head] Did that stupid clock give me a bump on my head?
[Squidward shows a clock-shaped bump on his head. A woman screams in the background.]
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: [grossed out] Ugh!
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob trying to fix his broken alarm clock. Patrick is asleep on top of his rock.]
SpongeBob: Oh, come on, come on. I still love you. Let me fix you. [flicks the part] Wow!
[The clock part flies into Patrick's mouth. Patrick wakes up from sleeping and swallows the part.]
Patrick: Ooh, hey, SpongeBob, what're you doing? [hops off his rock and goes over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm just trying to fix this old alarm clock. I'm gonna need that part you swallowed, by the way.
Patrick: That's cool. Just give a couple of hours. You know, [looks through SpongeBob's magnifying glass] I could totally fix your clock for you. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't know, Patrick. This clock means a lot to me and— [sees Patrick making an eager giggle] Well, okay, are you sure?
Patrick: Absolutely. Don't you worry. I promise to be super careful. [grabs some parts and tries to put them together, but they don't fit; he smashes them together in frustration] Why won't you fix?! [screams wildly as he grabs the blowhorn and smashes everything in pieces until he stops] Hmm? Uh... Sorry, SpongeBob, I couldn't fix it.
SpongeBob: Thanks for trying, Patrick, but I guess nothing lasts forever. Looks like I'm gonna need a new clock after all.
Patrick: Hmm! [laughs] In that case... [kicks some parts around and body slams them]
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob going to the clock store. He enters the store and loads of clocks are hanging on the walls.]
SpongeBob: Um, hello?
Con man: [pops out of the coo-coo clock] Hello, there! [shakes SpongeBob's hand] Welcome to Clock World, where we always have time [shows an alarm clock under his hat] for a bargain. How can I help you?
SpongeBob: [holds out a bag of the remains of his alarm clock] Do you have another alarm clock like my old one?
Con man: Hmm… [takes some of the clock's remains, licks it and examines it] Ah, the 740 Foghorn Wake-Em-Up Grand. I'm sorry to say they don't make this model anymore. But if you have a second, [shows SpongeBob a vast amount of clocks] I have many others I can show you. [giggles]
SpongeBob: Wow. So many to choose from. [his eyes are shown as clocks] Oh, I'll never be able to choose a clock with this many choices. Then I'll just take 'em all! [takes out a bunch of money and gives it to the salesman]
Con man: Ah! I'm rich! [laughs manically as he leaves the clock store] Whoo! [rushes over to the yacht store and gives the money to the yacht salesman] Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo! [hops into a yacht and drives away]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob setting a fire hydrant alarm clock.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: My old foghorn clock was the only alarm clock that could wake me up. Sure hope one of these works. [shows a huge pile of alarm clocks he bought] Goodnight, Gare-bear. [hops into bed and goes to sleep]
[Gary goes to sleep as well. The next morning, the fire hydrant alarm clock goes off and scares Gary. The firefighter figure sprays water in SpongeBob's body, making him bigger. But SpongeBob continues to sleep.]
French Narrator: [narrating time card] One hour later...
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Huh? [panics and rushes over to the Krusty Krab, but trips over due to being to big from absorbing the water]
[SpongeBob meets up Mr. Krabs and Squidward outside the restaurant. Mr. Krabs is angry with SpongeBob while Squidward finds this very amusing.]
Mr. Krabs: [sticks a late paper on SpongeBob] Late.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob setting his punching bag alarm clock.]
SpongeBob: I hope this one works. [hops into his bed and goes to sleep]
[The next morning, the punching bag alarm clock unzips itself. A bell is heard in the background and a boxing glove punches SpongeBob out of bed, injuring him in the process.]
French Narrator: [narrating time card] Late again...
[SpongeBob meets up Mr. Krabs and Squidward outside the restaurant again, this time on a wheelchair. Mr. Krabs is still angry with SpongeBob while Squidward still finds this very amusing.]
Mr. Krabs: [sticks a late paper on SpongeBob's cast] Late!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob sleeping in his bed with his jellyfish hive alarm clock set. It goes off and jellyfish fly onto SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [gets stung by the jellyfish]
French Narrator: [narrating time card] You get the idea!
[SpongeBob meets up Mr. Krabs and Squidward outside the restaurant again with his body all puffy from the jellyfish.]
Mr. Krabs: [sticks a late paper on SpongeBob] Late! [shows SpongeBob on fire with a late paper] Late! [shows SpongeBob with a clam eating his head and with a late paper on its shell] Late! [shows SpongeBob as a pile of dust on the ground with a late flag] Still late! [shows SpongeBob with arrows sticking through his head and a late paper] Late! [shows SpongeBob getting late papers all over his face] Late, late, late, late, late, late, late!
Squidward: [sticks a late paper on SpongeBob] Still late. [smiles maliciously at SpongeBob as he whimpers]
Mr. Krabs: Late again. [the papers fall off of SpongeBob] I told you before that you best not be late or else! But this time, I'll be emphasizing it with a furrowed brow. [looks closer at SpongeBob] Or else.
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob's pineapple home. SpongeBob is sitting in his chair with Gary on his head, thinking about what Mr. Krabs said.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't know how many more ""or else"" I can take. [looks at the alarm clock next to him] I have to figure out a way to wake up on time.
[The alarm clock rings. Gary meows excitedly and runs over to his food bowl. The feeding machine pours snail food into his bowl and Gary eats it.]
SpongeBob: Hey, what a great idea!
[SpongeBob gets up from his chair, takes all of the alarm clocks and goes off to do something with them. It took him all night long until morning arises. SpongeBob, who is now tired, goes back into his house. He climbs into bed and goes to sleep. Just then, the alarm system rings loudly and shines 6:00 down at him. The punching bag alarm clock punches SpongeBob out of his bed and lands into a wagon. The fire hydrant alarm clock sprays water at the wagon and sends SpongeBob to the door. The cuckoo clock ejects a boot and gives the wagon a little push. Outside the house, a loud thud and buzzing noise is heard. A clock with a spring pushes SpongeBob out from the front door. SpongeBob then rolls himself down the street into downtown Bikini Bottom. The street line of clocks push SpongeBob gently further down the street with their pendulums. SpongeBob rolls over to a clock in the middle of an intersection. The giant hand pushes SpongeBob to the other side. SpongeBob rolls through a painting scene that looks similar to The Persistence of Memory painting. Meanwhile at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs and Squidward are anxiously waiting for SpongeBob to arrive.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, I really thought that last ""or else"" would've worked. Maybe I should've wagged my finger.
[SpongeBob continues to roll down the street. The wagon stops and gets sucked into the sand. The sand turns out to be part of an hour glass. The door of the hour glass opens and SpongeBob rolls out while covered in sand. Sand flies off of SpongeBob's face. The wagons rolls SpongeBob right past Mr. Krabs and Squidward and into the front doors of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is really happy that SpongeBob made it to work while Squidward stood there in complete disbelief.]
Mr. Krabs: Right on time! [turns to another sponge named SpongeTom while Squidward groans in defeat] Looks like I won't be needing you after all, SpongeTom.
SpongeTom: [throws his spatula onto the ground] D'oh! [stomps away]
[SpongeBob rolls into the restaurant and crashes into the register boat. SpongeBob flies into the kitchen and kicks a plank, knocking over a barrel.]
SpongeBob: [half awake] Good morning...
[The barrel hits SpongeBob's head and puts his working hat on. SpongeBob continues to sleep as some wood burns on the grill, giving away some smoke. The smoke goes up the chimney, activating the log-shaped cuckoo clock. The clock's archer figure shots an arrow at Gary.]
Gary: Meow! [groans as he pulls the roll for SpongeBob's contraption]
[It turns out that SpongeBob spent the entire night at the Krusty Krab, building a contraption out of the alarm clocks he bought. The contraption is made to create Krabby Patties for the customers. As ingredients are being hung over a rope, one clock uses its pendulum to cut the patties in pieces. One cuckoo clock blasts fire at the patties. A lighthouse clock rolls out the buns. One clock spirts mustard and ketchup on the buns. All of the ingredients fall into the funnel and form into Krabby Patties. One patty falls on a catapult. It flings the patty toward a sleeping SpongeBob. SpongeBob's snoring blows a bubble for the patty to fly into. The bubble with the patty inside floats over the window. It pops and the patty falls on the plate, ringing the bell.]
Squidward: [takes the patty and gives it to the customer] Sadly, it looks like your order's on time today. [gives the customer the patty and the bell rings again for the next order] D'oh!
[The customer sticks a dollar in Mr. Krabs' pants.]
Mr. Krabs: [gleefully giggles and goes into the kitchen with his pants full of money] Glad you finally woke up on time, boy-o! [laughs as he leaves the kitchen]
[SpongeBob continues to sleep while the contraption continues making patties.]
SpongeBob: [sleepily] Just five more minutes, Gary. [leans over until Gary pushes him up]
[Squidward gives another customer a patty. Just then, Bubble Bass cuts in front of the line.]
Squidward: Sir, there's a line.
Bubble Bass: I'm filing a complaint. [holds out his half-eaten patty] I ordered this with extra pickles. And I only count fourteen.
Squidward: [places Bubble Bass' patty on the window] SpongeBob, we got a wrong order.
[SpongeBob continues to sleep. His snoring blows a bubble and floats a patty to the window. The bubble pops and the patty lands on the grill, setting it on fire. The fire builds up so much power in the chimney that is makes the wood-shaped alarm clock shoot various arrows at Gary. Gary yelps in pain and runs off while pulling the contraption's rope. SpongeBob's clock contraption goes haywire and it clogs up the funnel, making it explode and leaving the kitchen a total mess.]
Mr. Krabs: [comes in after hearing the explosion] What in Poseidon's beard?!
SpongeBob: [gasps as he finally wakes up] Oh! Oh! Good morning, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: It's not a good morning. First, you're late for days, and now you destroyed me kitchen!
[SpongeBob looks around and sees the mess the kitchen is in. SpongeBob giggles nervously at his angry boss.]
Mr. Krabs: [looms his angry eyes down at SpongeBob] Oh, looks like it's—
SpongeBob: [sweating nervously] Time for ""or else?""
Mr. Krabs: You better be at work on time or else [calmly] I'll have to open up and close the restaurant an hour later.
SpongeBob: [confused] Uh, what? [gets upset] No! [falls to his knees as Mr. Krabs smiles maliciously at SpongeBob]
[Suddenly, Patrick comes into the kitchen.]
Patrick: I did it! [shows SpongeBob the alarm clock and it's fixed]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Yes! Oh, Patrick, you fixed it!
Patrick: Uh, kind of.
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob sleeping in his bed the next morning. The foghorn alarm clock rings with Patrick making sound effects in the blowhorn. SpongeBob and Patrick share a good laugh and the episode irises out.]",1.36,Ben Gruber

He begins his daily routine by playing music from his record player, trying to lift his weights, eating his breakfast in a can, and brushing his teeth until his mirror cracks to think that the lady turtles will see him like this. He decides to make himself look clean and gets himself out of his shell and leaves. Meanwhile, Squidward begins to celebrate because he thinks that Patrick is leaving.While Tony is getting himself ready, Patrick wakes up and climbs on top of Tony's shell to break his morning almond with a wooden hammer. When Tony hears the whack, he starts wobbling to try to get Patrick off of his shell, and Patrick thinks that his rock is moving. Patrick grabs Tony and uses a jackhammer and a bomb to break his morning almond. Tony explains to Patrick that his rock is his shell, but Patrick does not want to leave, so he glues himself on top of Tony's shell. They go to the barber shop to remove Patrick from his shell, and a spa so that Patrick will get dehydrated from the steam, but both of these do not make Patrick leave.They make it to the Goo Lagoon to meet the lady turtles, but they are more interested in Patrick, which makes Tony jealous. Frustrated and tired of Patrick, Tony pops out of his shell, which leads Patrick to go inside his shell. When Patrick makes it into his shell, he uses his record collection as a frying pan, while using a frying pan as a record, and tearing his wall-art. The two cause havoc inside Tony's shell, which causes chaos to erupt at the Goo Lagoon, tipping over buildings, being tied to a swing set, and destroying the Krusty Krab, from which Patrick made a to go order. Eventually, a giant rock destroys their home, causing them to start crying, and the lady turtles decide to leave. Patrick gets an idea for a home that they can share. They decide to use Squidward's house as a rock and a shell. Tony walks away with Squidward's house as his shell and meets the lady turtles and they tell him he is looking sharp. The episode ends with Squidward arriving home from his shopping, seeing his house being taken by the turtles, and he begins to chase after them.",Shell Games,"[The episode starts off with a turtle named Tony, who is sleeping until his alarm clock goes off. Tony then smashes it. He looks around all tired.]
Tony: Oh, man. What time is it? I think I overslept. [scratches his underarm] Aah! I was supposed to meet the girls at the beach! [lifts his bed up] I hope they stick around till I get there. Alright, time to crush it. [turns on his record player and it starts playing music. He then goes to his barbell to lift some weights. He tries multiple times, but then he pretends to do pull ups. He then heads to the kitchen to find a can that has bacon, orange juice, eggs, and cereal] Aah, breakfast in a can. [opens the can and dumps food in his mouth, then bangs the can against his head. He then starts brushing his teeth. After he finishes brushing, he looks in the mirror with an ugly face, causing the mirror to crack] Attribute! I can't let the girls see me like this. I gotta get cleaned up. [heads to the door and tries to open it] Aw, come on! What's the deal?! [Tony finally opens it and pops out of his shell, which it's actually Patrick's house.] Ooh, boy. How long was I out? [picks a piece off of Patrick's rock] Ew. Long enough for all this crud to get stuck on my shell. [Patrick's rock is revealed to be Tony's shell. It turns out this whole time Patrick's home was a shell in Conch Street. Tony then smells the dirt.] Oh, nasty! [shakes the dirt off and puts glasses] Let's get this show on the road.
[Tony starts to hum as he starts leaving Conch Street. Squidward looks out his window and notices Tony leaving. But he thinks that is Patrick's house.]
Squidward: Well, there goes the neighborhood. [runs back with a party hat and confetti] For the better! So long, you big pink loser! [laughs]
[Patrick starts stretching and yawning while Tony starts walking. He then brushes his teeth, but while he does that, he bumps into a rock which cuts his body, he hits a mailbox, and then his stomach bumps into Old Man Walker. After Patrick finishes brushing his teeth, he crawls on top of Tony's shell and pulls out a walnut.]
Patrick: Time for my pre-breakfast snack. Come on out, yummy treat. [pulls out a hammer] Smashy! Smashy! Smashy! Smashy! [Tony shakes Patrick off his shell and continues walking.] Hey! Where are you going, rock? I don't wanna move! I really live next to my best friend Squidward, and that little yellow guy!
[Patrick runs to Tony and takes him back to Conch Street.]
Tony: What the? Oh, you gotta be kidding me! How did I get back here?! [Patrick puts his walnut back on Tony's shell and brings a jackhammer with him. He uses it to open his walnut. Patrick then throws it away and pulls out a bomb. Tony notices Patrick on his shell.] Huh? Oh, what do you think your doing, you moss parasite? [throws the bomb away] Sheesh.
[The bomb accidentally goes into Squidward's house.]
Squidward: What the? [The bomb explodes.] Ow...
Patrick: Hi, rock. I'm trying to enjoy a snack.
Tony: Hey, the name is Tony, not rock. And I think it's time for you to vamoose.
Patrick: Huh? What's a vanmoose?
[Patrick imagines a van that has the fur and antlers of a moose]
Tony: [chuckles] You're a few pickles short of a jar, ain't ya, kid? I'll make it simple. [knocks on his shell] This is my shell. I live here, you don't, so beat it!
Patrick: Oh no! You can't fool me! This is my rock, and I'm not leaving! [pulls out glue and glues himself on Tony's shell]
[Tony tries to get Patrick off of him, but gives up.]
Tony: Alright, you daba dose. Stay up there if you want. I've got places to be.
[Tony leaves Conch Street again, with Patrick on top of him. Transition to the Mel's Man Salon.]
Patrick: Where are we going?
Tony: Mel's Man Salon. [Patrick gets hit in the head.] Best place in town to get a manly makeover.
[Patrick and Tony enters inside the salon. Reg is seen hitting a bag and two men are getting shaved and having a haircut. One fish is getting his nails a makeover until he smashes them. Patrick looks around and sees three guys getting a hair salon. One fish has a big screw through his head.]
Mel: Hey! [laughs] Tony, good to see you again! But you're late.
Tony: Oh, sorry, Mel. I overslept a little.
Mel: A little? Your appointment was thirty years ago.
Tony: Thirty years? Ohhh! Hey, I never was a morning person.
Mel: Ah, you're telling me, Tony, come on over. I got a chair already for you.
[Mel starts shaving Tony's chin. He gives him the mirror and Tony looks at himself.]
Tony: Mel, you still give the closest shave in Bikini Bottom. Could you do one thing for me though?
Mel: Ah, sure. Anything for you, Tony.
Tony: Take a little off the top... [points to his shell with Patrick on it] of my shell!
[Mel sprays Patrick, then combs him, and then shaves his head until Patrick's head grows back.]
Patrick: [laughs] That tickles!
Tony: Well, it was worth a try. [grabs Patrick's head and leaves] Come on, kid, time for our next stop.
[Patrick and Tony makes it to the Bikini Bottom Bath House.]
Patrick: No, I don't want a bath! I already had one this year! Ew!
Tony: Don't get your Bermuda shorts in a bunch, buddy. We're just here for a spritz.
[They go in. Patrick hits his head]
[Tony and Patrick are in. Tony yawns]
Tony: [to Patrick] I tell ya, kid, this is the one wonders for my back. [one of the fishes next to them spills some water onto the lava rocks, making more steam] I must've slept on a rock for the last 30 years.
[Patrick starts sweating, then he dries; his shorts fill with his sweat and his head becomes tiny]
Tony: Oh, if it's too hot, you can always leave!
Patrick: No way! I'm just a little thirsty!
[a bell rings, suddenly a waiter comes in and gives Patrick a straw and puts it into his shorts]
[waiter leaves, Patrick starts drinking his own sweat and goes back to normal]
[bubble transition to the Goo Lagoon]
Tony: Here we are, kid! Last stop! [finds the lady turtles] Oh! There they are! [Tony goes to the lady turtles] Hello, ladies!
Lady turtle 1: Oh, so now he gets here!
Lady turtle 2: We've been waiting 30 years for you, Tony! You lucky turtles live so long!
Tony: I know, I know, my apologies. But never fear, Tony is--
Lady turtle 2: [to Patrick] Say, [pinches one of Patrick's cheeks] who's this?
Lady turtle 1: Oh, you didn't say you were bringing your pet [strokes Patrick's chin] parasite!
[Lady turtle 2 takes out a plate of cookies, and starts feeding them to Patrick.]
Lady turtle 2: Oh, now, this is a cutie!
Tony: Uh, hello? I didn't get all dolled up just to be treated like snail litter! [growls in anger] That's it! [goes out of his shell] All right, I've had it up to here with you! [the lady turtles continue laughing at Tony in his underpants. Tony is embarrassed at first, but continues to laugh.] Excuse me a second, ladies. [goes back inside of his shell, and sees Patrick in the kitchen. Tony growls angrily at him.]
Patrick: [notices Tony] Oh, hey, Tony! Check out all this cool stuff I didn't know I had in this attic I didn't know was here!
Tony: Buttagots! This ain't your attic, and that ain't your stuff!
Patrick: Look! [Patrick is frying an egg on one of Tony's records] The kitchen has everything I need to make omelets. You want one? [the egg and the record melt] Oops. Ah, time for a new frying pan! [takes out another record]
Tony: That ain't a pan, you ja like! You're melting my record collection!
Patrick: Oh! Oh, that would explain why the stereo isn't working! [the stereo has a frying pan on it]
Tony: My Hi-Fi! [gets crushed by the bed in the wall] Pasta fasul! [Tony gets his head out from beneath the bed]
Patrick: Oh, this is so cool! Look, there's a bed hiding in the wall! [Tony growls angrily at him] Ooh, I wonder if there's anything else hiding in the wall! [gasps] Maybe candy! [Patrick rips off a part of Tony's 'Lynyrd Squidyrd' poster.]
Tony: My wall art!
Patrick: No, nothing here. Dang. [jumps off the bed, and rips off a part of Tony's 'Fissh' poster] Nope. [Tony growls again, as Patrick jumps over to the wall, and is about to smash a mallet through it, but Tony throws the hammer away.]
Tony: [shouting at Patrick] Get out of my shell!
Patrick: [shouting at Tony] Get out of my rock!
Tony: [pushes Patrick] My shell !
Patrick: [attempts to push Tony] My shell! Uh, wait… rock !
[Tony jumps onto Patrick, and they start to have a fight, breaking a lamp and the stereo, as the lady turtles watch, still on the beach, as three Tony heads and three Patrick heads come out, and then comes back in. Lady turtle 1 laughs.]
Lady turtle 1: This is exciting!
Lady turtle 2: I've got a fiver on the parasite.
[The fight continues inside Tony's shell, and Tony's head comes out, and Patrick's head comes out from Tony's butt.]
Tony: [to Patrick] Hey, that's my butt!
Patrick: [to Tony] Oh, yeah? Well, now your butt is my face! [tries to move Tony's shell] I'm taking my home home!
Tony: Oh, no, you're not! [Tony stretches his hand towards a volleyball court, and holds onto it. The people playing volleyball run away as Patrick and Tony crash into the net, and are sent rolling around, crashing into the lifeguard tower (with Larry inside) and Larry falls into the sea. ]
Larry: [in the sea] Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! [the tide comes out] Oh.
[Patrick and Tony roll around the beach, crashing into various beach umbrellas. They then start to roll around the town, crashing into various buildings. They then pass the roadway, where Incidental 41 is attempting to cross, and he notices Tony and Patrick rolling around on the road.]
Incidental 41: Hey! [the green light goes on, and he is about to cross, but it then flattened by Tony and Patrick. They then get tied up in the swings on a playground, and two kids start riding on them.]
Tony: Hey! Get off of me, you brats!
[The kids walk away upon hearing this.]
Patrick: Aww, you guys! [A kid throws a stone at Tony, which makes him and Patrick start spinning around out of the playground. They crash through the Krusty Krab, and SpongeBob comes running out with a bag of food.]
SpongeBob: Hey! You forgot your to-go order! [Patrick and Tony come back, and Patrick collects the bag off of SpongeBob.]
Patrick: Thank you! [he and Tony continue spinning, and crash into a rock, breaking the shell/rock]
Tony: My shell!
Patrick: My rock!
Tony and Patrick: Our home! [both start crying, as the two turtle ladies watch them]
Lady turtle 2: Yeesh. Couple of babies over here.
Lady turtle 1: Who needs this weepy mess?
Lady turtle 2: Yeah, we came to see action. Let's vamoose. [the van moose that Patrick was dreaming about earlier on in the episode approaches, and the turtles step into it, as Tony and Patrick continue crying.]
Patrick: Oh, Tony, I'm so sorry.
Tony: I'm sorry too, kid.
Patrick: If we hadn't been fighting, we'd both still have a home. [he and Tony continue crying, but Patrick has an idea] Hey, wait a minute! I know another rock we could share!
Tony: Really? Hey, maybe you ain't so brainless after all.
[Bubble transition. Patrick, in sunglasses, sips a soda underneath what appears to be a blue rock, but is actually Squidward's house, and Tony comes out, and starts humming as he walks along with Squidward's house on his back. He passes the turtle ladies.]
Tony: Hey, ladies! Check out my new shell.
Both turtle ladies: Ooh! Looking sharp, Tony!
Squidward: [approaches with his grocery bag, and notices that his house is missing. He stammers] My house! Come back! [starts to chase after his house, as the camera irises out on it]",0.80,Andrew Goodman

The story's narrated by Fishmael Tentacles, an ancestor of Squidward, looking for work from town to town, ending up in a seaside town. He comes across and subsequently slips on jellyfish jelly, leading him into The Jelly Squirt Inn, landing right at the bar's counter, meeting an old-timey Capn' A. Krabs and a parakeet version of Plankton named Planky. Planky offers him some jelly, but Fishmael explains that he's only here to find an occupation, suggesting a potential career as a cashier to Krabs. Unfortunately, Fishmael is denied of a job - but thankfully for him, Pat-Buck snatches him under a table and tells him of a gig as a crew member on Captain SpongeHab's pineapple ship. Fishmael refuses to work on a ship, thinking it's too low-brow, but Pat-Buck ignores his reply, knocks him out, and kidnaps him.Fishmael finds himself on SpongeHab's quarters, and Pat explains that the captain has a special job for him, so the star shows him the ""ropes,"" literally, going on with teaching him. All of that ropey education was only meant for Fishmael to be tied up to the ship's pole with his tentacles, and Pat-Buck along with the rest of the sailors (jellyspotter anchovies) frolic around enjoying themselves. That is, until Captain SpongeHab enters the scene with a frightening presence, telling the crew all about great-white jellyfish Dopey Dick with bubble-gum imagery, and saying to give him a holler if they see him. Quickly enough, Dopey's spotted and the crew scrambles to catch him. SpongeHab tells Fishmael he's got a special job for him, and it ends up being used a harpoon to reel in the jellyfish. Dopey and Fishmael are on a wild chase for quite a while, so Fishmael uses his awful recorder-playing skills to calm Dopey down. This ends up working, and Dopey is caught and pulled just above the ship's platform. SpongeHab then shows the crew the best part of hunting down and catching a jellyfish - releasing it. The anchovies and Pat-Buck are initially disappointed, but it later warms their heart. Everything seems like it's off to a good conclusion, but it abruptly comes to a pause when Dopey is hooked in by another ship.That ship turns to be the ones owned by Capn' A Krabs and Planky, who instead of catching and releasing Dopey Dick, plan to exploit his jelly and kill him off. SpongeHab, Fishmael, and Pat-Buck angrily rebel against this, but the anchovy sailors quickly switch sides and Planky destroys the near entirety of their ship with the power of nematodes. Despite all the destruction, SpongeHab still wants to save Dopey, and Pat-Buck is commanded to use his oar and follow the evil duo who kidnapped the great-white.Day turns to night, and the crew quietly sneaks onto Krabs and Planky's ship while they're asleep and rescue Dopey Dick, who thanks them and escapes. Their plans are immediately foiled when the opposing crew awakes, and they seem doomed, but Dopey snatches them from the ship. Krabs and Planky try to harpoon Dopey back onto the ship, but the jellyfish turns around and rams into it, leaving the boat destroyed. Krabs and Planky try to avoid Dopey in the ocean, but their harpoons leave them tied onto him when brought out of the water. After a day of complete mania, a frightened Fishmael states that he doesn't want to work with SpongeHab anymore, causing the sponge and Pat-Buck to laugh. Dopey then jumps into the remains of Krabs and Planky's ship, creating a whirlpool and leaving Fishmael as the lone survivor of ""Dopey Dick.""The scene cuts to Fishmael back at the Jelly Squirt Inn, turning out to be a story that he told all along. Everyone at the inn laughs at how he over-exaggerates himself as the hero, as they were all there themselves. Fishmael angrily leaves the inn, and everyone gets another round of jellyfish jelly on the house. Dopey Dick squirts jelly to all of the inn's customers, even Fishmael, who grumpily stands outside. Dopey subsequently closes the book he opened in the beginning of the episode and Fishmael states ""The End,"" concluding the segment.",Dopey Dick,"[The episode opens with Dopey Dick's hand opening a book titled after him. A grayscale image of a Squidward-like character called Fishmael is on the front page.]
Fishmael: [narrating] Welcome to the terrific, tumultuous tale of Dopey Dick. [fade into the book, as Fishmael walks alongside a street] Call me Fishmael. In my youth, I was an intrepid, fresh-faced journeyman, looking from town to town for any work I could find. Little did I know, I was about to step in some-- [slips in some jellyfish jelly and shouts] Jellyfish jelly? Whoaaa!
[Fishmael slips into the Jelly Squirt In. His head gets caught between the saloon doors. Fishmael grabs onto the counter, and Capn' A. Krabs, a lookalike of Mr. Krabs, with a parrot version of Plankton, named Planky, on his shoulder comes up at the counter.]
Capn' A. Krabs: Welcome to the Jelly Squirt Inn. How can we help, me hearty?
Anchovy: [entering doors] Excuse me.
[Fishmael screams as his head snaps back and hits the cash register. He pulls it back, and it's still squished, so he shakes his head to get it back to normal.]
[Capn' A. Krabs grunts.]
Planky: [jumps off Capn' A. Krabs' shoulder and squawks, then grabs a purple glass] Have some jelly juice, lad?
Fishmael: No, thanks. I'm job hunting. Might you lubbers have employment for an able-legged young buck with [goes behind the register and operates it] cash register experience?
Capn' A. Krabs: [shuts the cash register on Fishmael's tentacles] No, no!
Fishmael: [screams]
Capn' A. Krabs: Nobody touches me money but me!
Planky: Buy some jelly, or get out! [points away and squawks]
Fishmael: Here you go. [flips coin on Planky, crushing him]
Planky: Huh? Ow!
[Fishmael drinks the juice and hears someone whispering to him.]
Pat-Buck: [off-screen] Psst. Hey, come here. Hey, buddy.
[Fishmael walks up to a table and is pulled under it by Pat-Buck, a Patrick lookalike. His head hits the edge of the table, and he yelps.]
Pat-Buck: [as people walk by] Shh. [whispering] I've heard tell that a boat called ""Ye Olde Pineapple"" is shipping out soon, and they need more hands. [shakes Fishmael's legs] You've got plenty of hands. [squishes against him] I think I hear them cutting the ship right now. [huddles closer]
[At the port, two anchovies cut off half of a giant pineapple. The half that falls has a sail hoisted.]
Fishmael: [nervously] Uh, thanks, but I always get seasick. I wouldn't be caught dead on a ship. [crawls away]
Pat-Buck: [seriously] I'm so sorry to hear that. [taps Fishmael on the head with a club]
Fishmael: Ow!
Pat-Buck: Shhh!
Fishmael: [groans as Pat-Buck drags him away]
[Pat-Buck holds up Fishmael in a net.]
Fishmael: Got one!
Inn patrons: [cheering]
[Ye Olde Pineapple sets sail. Pat-Buck dumps Fishmael onto the boat. The other crew members are anchovies.]
Fishmael: [gasps and flops on the surface, then inhales] I've been Egads! I've been squid-napped!
Pat-Buck: Yup. The captain has a special job just for ye.
Fishmael: For me?
Pat-Buck: [happily] No, for ye .
Fishmael: [considering] Well, I do need a job. [shrugs] Ah, if I get seasick, I get seasick.
Pat-Buck: Oh, don't worry. I'll show ye the ropes. [Fishmael smiles, but frowns when Pat-Buck shows him a tangle of rope] There's the big rope, [shows him a small rope] the little rope, [Fishmael glances at the audience; Pat-Buck makes himself frown with the rope] the frowny rope, [smiles with the rope] the smiley rope, [takes out licorice rope] and the licorice rope! [slurps it] This one's mine!
Fishmael: [shudders]
Pat-Buck: [swallows licorice rope] Ahh. [leans forward] Do you know how to tie a knot?
[Pat-Buck leans in very close to Fishmael, who looks uncomfortable.]
Fishmael: [nervously] No, but I'd love to learn.
Pat-Buck: I'll teach ya.
Fishmael: [imitating the French Narrator while reading time card] Later...
[Pat-Buck ties Fishmael's tentacles in a knot, tying him to a pole. He plays the accordion and sings as the anchovies dance.]
Fishmael: Typical.
[Loud footsteps are heard, catching Fishmael's attention. Pat-Buck stops playing and turns around. The anchovies huddle together. Sponge-Hab, a captain who looks like SpongeBob, with a spatula leg and a beard, steps on board. Fishmael gets nervous.]
Sponge-Hab: Avast ye. I be Captain Sponge-Hab. Argh! [his beard falls down, he blushes and excuses himself] Hmm? Oh. [chuckles nervously and puts his beard back on] I brought you all here for a special mission-- to hunt down the great white jellyfish, Dopey Dick.
Pat-Buck: [gasps]
Anchovies: [worried] Meep, meep!
Fishmael: [afraid] Was Dopey Dick the beast who took off thy leg, Captain?
Sponge-Hab: Naw. My leg is all squeezed into the handle. [laughs and pulls the spatula off his leg, showing it compressed, then puts it back in] I just love the sound my spatula makes. [jumps around on the deck as the spatula clanks]
[Pat-Buck and the anchovies clap. One anchovy nudges Fishmael, who starts laughing as well.]
Fishmael: [hesitant laughter]
Sponge-Hab: [laughs, then looks serious]
[Pat-Buck and the anchovies stop laughing and clapping. Sponge-Hab flings a wad of gum into the air with his spatula foot. He chews it and blows a bubble, which takes the form of a jellyfish. The crewmates gasp as the shadow comes over them.]
Sponge-Hab: Dopey Dick is a great white jellyfish, lads. And he's the size of a split-level condominium.
Anchovies: Meep.
Pat-Buck: [impressed] All that jelly!
Anchovy: [imitating Pat-Buck] Meep meep meep!
Anchovies: Meep meep meep!
Pat-Buck and Anchovies: Meep meep meep! Meep meep meep!
Fishmael: Um, uh, meep meep?
[The Dopey Dick gum bubble collides with a nail in the mast and explodes. Pat-Buck and the anchovies run away,a nd the jelly falls on Fishmael.]
Sponge-Hab: So keep your eyes peeled for Dopey Dick. [the crewmates watch, and Dopey Dick jumps behind Sponge-Hab] And if ye spot him, just give me a holler.
[The crewmates shout and point frantically.]
Sponge-Hab: [approving] Yes, just like that! [Dopey Dick jumps behind him again] That is exactly what you should do when you actually see him.
[The anchovies run up to Sponge-Hab, pick him up, and turn him around. He sees Dopey Dick jumping in the ocean and reacts with shock.]
Sponge-Hab: Huh? [angrily] Dopey Dick!
Dopey Dick: [raises from water] Doy, doy, doy, doy!
Pat-Buck: [dopey] Doy, doy, doy. [points] Jellyfish be dumb.
[Dopey Dick jumps away.]
Sponge-Hab: Chase that snow-hilled hump!
[The anchovies panic and run away. Sponge-Hab eyes Fishmael still tied to the pole.]
Sponge-Hab: You, in the smart wool cap. I have a special job for ye.
Fishmael: [nervously] Uh, I be ready. What is it?
[Sponge-Hab walks away and snaps his fingers. The anchovies untie Fishmael.]
Fishmael: Whoa. Oh! [the anchovies put his head in a harpoon gun] This is the special job?
Sponge-Hab: [cheerfully] Uh-huh. You'll make a great sticky harpoon. [laughs] Fire!
[Pat-Buck fires the harpoon. Fishmael screams as he sails through the air.]
Fishmael: Okay, now I'm gonna throw up. [retches, then keeps screaming, then grabs onto Dopey Dick and gets shocked]
Sponge-Hab: We got him! [ties knot to post]
Fishmael: [screams]
Dopey Dick: Doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy!
[As Fishmael and Dopey Dick are pulled, Ye Olde Pineapple goes with them.]
Fishmael: He's got us! [Dopey Dick rides over a rock] Whoa!
Anchovies: [riding over the rock] Meep!
[A map shows Dopey Dick's movement zigzagging around as everyone shouts.]
Fishmael: Oh, please slow down, Dopey Dick! I don't have anything left to throw up! [gets an idea] Wait, I know how to soothe a savage beast! [takes a flute out of his pocket with his tongue, then plays it badly]
Sponge-Hab and anchovies: [cover their ears] Ohh!
Pat-Buck: Ahh! My ears are biting me! [rips them off and sighs in relief]
Dopey Dick: Hmm. Doy, doy, doy. [slows down and splashes around] Doy, doy, doy. Doy.
Sponge-Hab: Argh! Dopey Dick cannot resist the music. [to crew] Quick, everyone! [anchovies run away] Reel him in!
Anchovies: [meeping]
[An anchovy throws a rope over the mast. Pat-Buck and the anchovies pull and Dopey Dick starts sliding backwards.]
Dopey Dick: Doy, doy, doy, doy, doy.
[Dopey Dick is hoisted up.]
Sponge-Hab: [seriously] Now, me hearties, comes the best part of hunting down and catching a jellyfish.
Anchovy: Spreading the jelly? [anchovies take out toast]
Pat-Buck: [panting and holding a giant, empty jar of jelly] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sponge-Hab: No, you sillies!
[The anchovies and Pat-Buck are disappointed.]
Sponge-Hab: Releasing the jellyfish!
[Sponge-Hab extends his spatula leg and pries Fishmael's suction cups off Dopey Dick. Dopey Dick falls into the ocean.]
Dopey Dick: Doy! [pats Sponge-Hab on the head]
Sponge-Hab: [laughs, then gets shocked]
Pat-Buck: [throws jar overboard] Awww.
Anchovies: Meeeep.
Sponge-Hab: [waving] Fly and be free, Dopey Dick!
Dopey Dick: [waving] Doy, doy! [jumps away] Doy. Doy. Doy doy doy.
[Another ship catches Dopey Dick in its net.]
Dopey Dick: Whoop! Doy... Doy...
[Capn' A. Krabs and Planky reel Dopey Dick in.]
Planky: [evil laugh]
Sponge-Hab: [shouting] Ahoy, mateys! Nice catch! Now it's your turn to release him! [laughs]
Planky: [scoffs] We're not releasing bupkis! [squawks]
Capn' A. Krabs: [sarcastically, pets Planky] Oh, I'm sorry, Cap'n. I'm afraid we're just gonna keep Dopey Dick and sell his jelly for money! [laughs] Money, money, money, money, money, money, money!
Dopey Dick: [weak] Doy, doy.
Sponge-Hab: [gasps] How can he exploit such a rare and gentle creature? Dopey Dick is our friend. And if ye think you're just gonna swoop in here and put our friend in a cage, ye've got another thing coming! [pounds fist and raises it] Right, me loyal crew? Huh?
[A splash is heard. The anchovies are meeping and paddling a smaller boat away.]
Sponge-Hab: Shiver me timbers! It's a reverse mutiny!
Planky: [holding match] Hey, Fake-Beard! Put this in your poop deck! [squawks, lights match and fires cannon, then blows out the match]
[Sponge-Hab gasps and ducks under the cannonball.]
Sponge-Hab: Phew!
[The cannonball crashes into Pat-Buck's belly and falls on the ground. Fishmael walks up to it.]
Fishmael: Ha, ha! Ye cannonball is a dud.
Capn' A. Krabs: Wait for it...
[A black paper unfurls around the cannonball, revealing a cluster of nematodes.]
Nematode: Hungry.
Nematodes: Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry.
Sponge-Hab: Nematodes! Ahh!
[The nematodes eat the entire ship, leaving behind a single slice of pineapple, and jump into the ocean.]
Anchovy: Wah, wah, waaah.
[The anchovies are on Capn' A. Krabs' ship. They all laugh, along with Capn' A. Krabs and Planky, as their ship sails away.]
Sponge-Hab: We've got to save Dopey Dick from them pilfering pirates!
Fishmael: We're gonna need a bigger pineapple!
Sponge-Hab: Scupper that! Pat-Buck, follow those bilge rats!
Pat-Buck: [salutes] Aye, aye, Captain Sponge-Hab! [coughs up a paddle and uses it to steer the ship]
[Pan up to show the sun. It transitions into the moon. Everyone on Capn' A. Krabs' ship is asleep and snoring. Sponge-Hab, Pat-Buck, and Fishmael look on-board to see Dopey Dick having his jelly harvested into jars.]
Dopey Dick: [weakly] Doy. Doy, doy.
Sponge-Hab: [worried] Dopey!
Pat-Buck: Shh! [stomach growling] Quiet, stomach! You'll wake everybody!
Sponge-Hab: Follow me, me hearties!
[Sponge-Hab walks carefully past some sleeping anchovies. Fishmael follows him. Pat-Buck surveys it, but ends up stepping on every one as he tries to cross.]
Anchovies: Meep. Meep. Meep.
Pat-Buck: [stomach growls]
Fishmael: Huh? Huh? [puts hand on it] Shhh!
[Pat-Buck's stomach bites Fishmael's hand and he screams. Sponge-Hab shushes him.]
Anchovy: [drowsy] Who's there? [touches mop] Oh, it's you, honey. [falls back asleep]
Pat-Buck: [wipes sweat off forehead] That was close.
Pat-Buck's stomach: Shh!
Pat-Buck: Sorry!
Dopey Dick: [weakly] Doy. Doy. Doy. [Sponge-Hab approaches, excitedly] Doy, doy, doy!
Sponge-Hab: [grabs sucker] Sit tight, Dopey! We're gonna cut you loose!
[Sponge-Hab removes the suction device.]
Dopey Dick: Doy, doy! [pats him on the head and shocks him]
Sponge-Hab: [laughing]
Fishmael: Not if he keeps doing that, we won't. [removes suction device]
Dopey Dick: [happily] Doy!
[Sponge-Hab unties Dopey Dick from the post.]
Sponge-Hab: There you go! All free, Dopey!
Dopey Dick: Doy, doy! [jumps off the boat and waves at them] Doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy. [jumps away]
Sponge-Hab: Ain't jellyfishing wonderful?
[Sponge-Hab, Pat-Buck, and Fishmael turn around to face Capn' A. Krabs, Planky, and the anchovies.]
Capn' A. Krabs: [threatingly] Somebody owes me 300 tons of jellyfish jelly.
Planky: I wonder if [points] octopuses give jelly. [squawks]
Fishmael: [whimpers]
Pat-Buck: [slides between his legs with a bucket] Do they?
Fishmael: No!
Sponge-Hab: [with pad of paper, to Capn' A. Krabs] Kind sir, will ye take an IOU?
Capn' A. Krabs: [stretches Sponge-Hab's eye] I'll take an eye... or two! [snaps it back]
[An anchovy wields a cutlass and advances on the crew.]
Dopey Dick: [faintly] Doy, doy!
Anchovy: Meep?
Capn' A. Krabs: Do ye hear it, lads? Do ya? Dopey Dick's song! [points] We still have a chance to catch him! Everyone, beat to quarters!
Anchovies: [meeping]
[Dopey Dick jumps over the ship. He grabs Sponge-Hab, Pat-Buck, and Fishmael.]
Capn' A. Krabs: [gasps, growls]
[Capn' A. Krabs runs up the crow's nest with a plunger harpoon gun and kicks out another anchovy who's already there.]
Anchovy: Meeeep!
Planky: [jumps on harpoon gun] Hardy har-poon, sucker!
[Capn' A. Krabs and Planky fire their harpoons, which hit Dopey Dick.]
Dopey Dick: [notices] Doy? [angrily] Doy! [swims after them]
Sponge-Hab: Dopey! No!
Capn' A. Krabs and Planky: [screams]
Dopey Dick: [rams through the ship] Doy!
[Capn' A. Krabs and Planky fall off and into the ocean. Anchovies are grabbing onto the wreckage.]
Anchovies: [meeping]
[Dopey Dick circles the wreckage. Capn' A. Krabs notices something and gasps. When Dopey surfaces, Capn' A. Krabs and Planky are tied to him.]
Planky: Cut me loose, you Dopey dunce! [squawks]
Capn' A. Krabs: For hate's sake, we spit our last breath at thee! [they spit, but it flies back in their faces]
Fishmael: [panting] Captain Sponge-Hab, I don't wanna work here anymore!
Sponge-Hab and Pat-Buck: [laughing] Woo-hoo!
Dopey Dick: Doy! [dives down] Doy! [jumps over the ship]
Anchovies: [panicked meeping]
[Dopey jumps into the wreckage and causes a whirlpool, which sucks the anchovies and ship parts inside. Fishmael surfaces, leaning over a plank of wood.]
Fishmael: [narrating] And that's how I became the sole survivor of the hunt for Dopey Dick.
[Fade to him in the Jelly Squirt Inn. Sponge-Hab, Pat-Buck, and the inn patrons laugh at him.]
Capn' A. Krabs: You weren't the sole survivor! We were all there! [he and Planky laugh]
Fishmael: It's my story! I'm the hero! And I can end it any way I want! [storms out]
Capn' A. Krabs, Planky, and inn patrons: Aww, Fishmael! [laughing]
Capn' A. Krabs: [puts glasses on counter] You're all buying another round of jelly juice!
[Everyone cheers and laughs. Dopey Dick is behind a counter. He sprays jelly from his tentacles.]
Sponge-Hab: Yay! Yay! Yay!
Anchovies: Meep, meep, meep!
[The jelly pushes over an anchovies, Sponge-Hab and Pat-Buck, some anchovies, Capn' A. Krabs, and Planky. Fishmael is outside the inn.]
Fishmael: Those scurvy swine wouldn't know a good story if it bit them on the-- [screams and gets washed away by a stream of jelly]
[Dopey Dick's arm closes the book, creating a splat of jelly.]

When the bus finally comes, Squidward is annoyed at the driver for being late. During the bus ride, Squidward makes many annoying comments, making the bus driver increasingly angry. He arrives at the Krusty Krab and Squidward comes out, only for him to tell the driver that he could do his job better than him. The bus driver states that he could do Squidward's job better than him. Listening to this conversation, Mr. Krabs intervenes and tells the two that they should switch jobs to settle things once and for all.Squidward starts driving the bus, with several of the passengers disliking him as the bus driver. However, Squidward still enjoys being the bus driver until SpongeBob comes along and plays around in the bus, as that day is his bus-riding day where he chooses to ride on a bus with no stops (and he happened to pick this exact one), much to the dismay of Squidward. After a while, Squidward sees Patrick wanting to go on the bus, and tries to drive past him, but fails to do so. SpongeBob and Patrick start playing around in the bus again, distracting Squidward from driving as well as hurting passengers on the bus.Because of SpongeBob and Patrick's antics, all the passengers except for the two leave the bus. Infuriated, Squidward storms out of the driver seat to the back of the bus and demands SpongeBob and Patrick leave the bus, but since he left the driver's seat, the bus goes out of control and goes off a highway into the depths of Crush County. Since the bus was not designed to withstand the pressure at this location, the entire vehicle starts to crush down. The three get scared, but thankfully SpongeBob has a map that allows Squidward to drive the bus back to the Krusty Krab. The bus driver is seen trying to deal with the customers at the Krusty Krab, but he gets frustrated and quits the job. The customers are satisfied to see Squidward as the cashier again, making Squidward happy to have that job.",Squid's on a Bus,"[The episode begins with Squidward waiting impatiently for the bus.]
Squidward: [grumbles as he checks his watch] Where's that bus? I've been waiting for almost an hour!
Lady skeleton: [sitting on a bench] Heh. Almost an hour he says. [crumbles into dust and gets blown away by the wind]
[Just then, the bus arrives at the bus stop and the door opens.]
Squidward: [enters the bus] Hmm. [shows the driver his watch] Late again. [takes out a quarter] One coin. Exact change. [the coin winks] Exactly. [flips the coin] Clink. [takes a seat as the coin falls into the coin deposit]
Bus driver: [rolls his eyes in annoyance] Oh, brother... [begins to drive the bus to the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Will you please watch your speed? And stay in the lane. [looks on the floor] When was the last time you cleaned this bus? [sniffs] Ew, it smells like a narwhal's armpit in here.
Bus driver: [grows angry with Squidward's annoying comments] All right, that's it! [pushes the brake and stops the bus, making Squidward fall onto the window] Krusty Krab! [flips the window and Squidward slides off]
Squidward: You big clod! I could do your job better than you ever could!
Bus driver: [comes out of the bus] Yeah? Well, I could do your job better than you ever could! [pulls down Squidward's nose and flips it up like a window shade] What's his job?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, he's a terrible cashier.
[Squidward stops his head from spinning.]
Bus driver: That I could do!
[Squidward and the bus driver growl in each other's face until Mr. Krabs, acting as the peacemaker, gets in between them.]
Mr. Krabs: [pushes Squidward and the bus driver out with his eyestalks] All right, all right! Jumpin' jellyfish! I'm tired of you two bickering every morning! I say prove it! [switches hats with Squidward and the bus driver] Switch jobs right now and settle it once and for all.
Bus driver: I'll take that challenge.
Mr. Krabs: [to Squidward] You better get going, driver. You're already behind schedule. [heads back into the Krusty Krab]
[Squidward and the bus driver growl at each other before going to their new jobs. Squidward runs into the bus and the bus driver heads into the Krusty Krab. Squidward sits in the bus seat and adjusts the mirror. Squidward sighs happily with his new job and goes to pulls the lever to make the bus move. But he inexplicably made the bus move for a few moments due to the break being on. Squid's lack of experience in the bus causes physical harm to the passengers until he manages to put the bus into driving mode.]
Squidward: [humming to himself] Oh, I like this. [stops the bus and picks up an old lady] Good morning.
Incidental 82: It's afternoon already, clown! [attempts to hit Squidward with her umbrella, but is halted by Squidward]
Squidward: Eh, ah-ah. No sharp objects allowed. [puts umbrella in a box full of sharp stuff; he hears munching sounds] Huh? [sees Incidental 160 eating a Krabby Patty and begins talking through microphone] Attention: this is your cheerful driver speaking. There'll be no eating or drinking aboard my happy bus... [rudely takes the Krabby Patty from Incidental 160 using Incidental 82's umbrella] Especially Krabby Patties. [throws the umbrella and Krabby Patty out the window and drives away, leaving them stuck to a man's head; stops the bus at another bus stop] This stop is Coral Boulevard. Thank you for riding with your merry bus driver. And have a beautiful da— [opens the door and, much to his dismay, sees SpongeBob standing there] hey...
SpongeBob: Squidward!
Squidward: Nooo!
SpongeBob: [hops onboard the bus] It's you! [jumps up and hugs Squidward] I've always dreamed one day I'd board a bus and see you driving it.
Squidward: Why am I in that dream?
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, you're in all my dreams.
Squidward: [struggles to get SpongeBob off] Get off me and pay your fare! And you'd better have— [sees SpongeBob holding a hug wallet of coins] huh?
SpongeBob: Exact change. Exactly . [takes one coin at a time and puts them in the coin deposit] Clink, clink, clink, [the screen becomes dark at night] clink, clink, clink, [the screen becomes lighter at day again] clink, clink.
Squidward: Augh! Enough with the pennies! [swats the wallet away]
SpongeBob: [continues paying the fare with his coins] Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink.
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob standing next to Squidward while driving. He pretends he's driving alongside Squidward.]
SpongeBob: [hums] Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. [Squidward grumbles] Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.
Squidward: What?!
SpongeBob: I'm helping you drive. [makes driving hand motions]
Squidward: No, you're not.
SpongeBob: Time to switch lanes. Better use my signal. [makings weird noises while pretending to drive]
[SpongeBob's fake driving annoys Squidward so much that is makes him lose concentration on the road. The bus swerves left and right, causing on boat to fly off the highway and crash into a billboard.]
Squidward: Don't help me drive!
SpongeBob: Okay.
[SpongeBob lets go of the invisible steering wheel and the bus nearly tips over. Squidward grabs the invisible steering wheel and sets the bus back up.]
Squidward: Whew! Oh, what am I doing?! Sit in the back!
SpongeBob: Okay! [heads over to the back seats and sits down]
[Bubble transition to Squidward continuing to drive the bus. SpongeBob continuously annoys Squidward by seating in one seat to another.]
Squidward: [looks at the mirror and sees SpongeBob seating in the back; he goes back to driving, but sees SpongeBob in another seat] What—what the... [SpongeBob waves at Squidward as he sighs; he looks up, sees SpongeBob in the mirror, and screams]
SpongeBob: Objects in mirror are closer than they appear. [laughs and pulls himself out of the mirror] Aw, let me help. [puts a pillow under the brake] This is for softer braking.
Squidward: [tries to use the brakes, but he can't push it down due to the pillow shoved in between] Augh, the brakes don't work!
[The bus speeds down the road and Squidward tries desperately to push down the brakes. The bus gets coated with fire and zooms through the intersection at a fast speed. Squidward removes the pillow and presses the brake to slow the bus down. Squidward throws the pillow out the window and hits Frank. Frank turns around and gets angry that someone threw it at him. He throws the pillow at an old lady on a scooter. The old lady gets up and throws the pillow back at Frank. Soon, everyone in Bikini Bottom is having a pillow fight with each other.]
Squidward: SpongeBob, what is your stop, so I can take you there right now?!
SpongeBob: [steps on other people's heads while heading to the driver seat] Oh, I don't have a stop. Today is my bus riding day, the day I just pick a bus and ride it all day. [lays on Squidward's head]
Squidward: There's only one thing I can think of that could be worse. [screams as he sees Patrick waving at a bus stop] Augh! And that's it! [drives to bus pass Patrick, which makes him drill himself into the sand] Phew. I dodged that one. Heh-heh. [sees Patrick at another bus stop; he turns the wheel and flips the bus over Patrick; he continues to drive] Phew. That was close.
Patrick: [appears next to Squidward] It sure was. I almost didn't catch this bus.
[Squidward is completely overwhelmed and turns his head in anger.]
SpongeBob: Eeeee….Patrick! Wow! We're both on the same bus on our Just Riding Around On The Bus Day! What are the odds?
[Squidward's eyes spin like a slot machine. His eyes stop with a laughing SpongeBob and Patrick on them.]
Squidward: Yes, what are the odds?
Patrick: I got my bus money somewhere. [digs in his pants and pulls out SpongeBob] Oh, there it is! [puts SpongeBob down] Huh, I think I left my wallet in my other wallet.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, buddy. [holds out his back of coins] I've got exact change.
Patrick: [takes one coin at a time, licks them and puts them in the coin deposit] One...Two...Three.
[Squidward's eyes and nose melt off his face. Bubble transition to Squidward humming to himself while driving. But his peace and quiet ended when SpongeBob and Patrick are shaking the bus while swinging onto bus straps.]
Squidward: You hooligans!
[Patrick injuries Fred with his overweight body while swinging. The ruckus in the bus causes Squidward to crash several boats on the road.]
SpongeBob: And now, SpongeBob will attempt to catch his high-flying partner, Patrick, while swinging from the strap of death.
Patrick: [swings on the bus strap] Hey—oh! [flips in the air, which amuses the other bus passengers]
[Patrick and SpongeBob prepare to finish their act. But just when SpongeBob was about to catch Patrick, Patrick misses and falls on an old lady's snail.]
Mable: Awwww. Ohhh, yes.
Squidward: Lady, get that horrible thing off your lap!
Mable: I'll do no such thing! He's my emotional support animal. [rubs Patrick's butt] Oh, yes, aren't you?
[SpongeBob crawls around on the floor and barks like a worm. Patrick hisses like a snail and they both chase each other under the seats. As they chase, they hit the bus passengers as they sit.]
Fred: [gets hit by SpongeBob and Patrick] My leg!
[SpongeBob and Patrick continuously chases each other while hurting people on the bus. Bubble transition to all the passengers, now in casts and bandages, who have had enough with SpongeBob and Patrick's antics and exit the bus. Squidward closes the door and proceeds to drive. SpongeBob and Patrick sit quietly in the back. Squidward grumbles silently at them right before Patrick belches. He turns his head and is now really, really angry.]
Squidward: [growls] That's it! I am throwing you two off right now! [heads to the back seat and Patrick is not there] Where's that pink pinhead?
SpongeBob: Oh, he's in the restroom.
Squidward: Huh? [sees the emergency exit door] That's not a restroom, it's the emergency exit.
[A toilet flushing sound is heard. Patrick opens the emergency exit door in Squidward's face and climbs back in the bus.]
Patrick: You're out of toilet paper. Who's driving?
Squidward: Well, I am, of course. [sees no one in the driver's seat] Wah!
[Since the bus has no one in the driver's seat, it is driving out of control. It crashes into the end freeway sign and falls into a deep crevice. The bus's gravity gets slower and the bus lands safely on the ground. When SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward look out the window, they see everything completely smooshed. It turns out they landed in a place called Crush County. Suddenly, the bus begins to crush due to the pressure of the crevice.]
Squidward: This bus isn't designed for the pressure at these depths.
[The bus's rivets pop out and fly everywhere, nearly hitting SpongeBob and Patrick. Squidward gets hit by the incoming rivets and gets covered by them. Water leaks into the bus as it continues to get crushed. The pressurized bus smooshes SpongeBob and Patrick.]
SpongeBob: [giggles] Look at you.
Patrick: [chuckles] Look at you.
[SpongeBob and Patrick share a good laugh. A smooshed Squidward attempts to drive the bus through Crush County as the bus continues to pressurize.]
Squidward: We're gonna be crushed to death! I don't wanna drive a bus. [gets sprayed by water]
SpongeBob: I don't wanna be crushed!

[Squidward drives the bus past some geysers.]
SpongeBob: [sees someone in the street] Hey, look, a passenger. Hi!
[The passenger at the Crush County bus stop is a grim reaper. Squidward screams in horror and drives the bus past him. The grim reaper throws his scythe in anger as Squidward continues driving.]
Squidward: I don't know where we're going.
SpongeBob: Don't worry. I have a bus map. [takes out a map and reads it] Take a left. Take another left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left, left, left.
Squidward: [the map blocks the window] I can't see!
SpongeBob: We don't need to see. We just need to believe.
Squidward: I believe your map is upside-down.
SpongeBob: Oh, I can fix that.
[SpongeBob pulls down the lever, flips the bus over, lands in a geyser and it erupts the bus out of Crush County. Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab, the bus driver is having a hard time working as a cashier as angry customers are constantly complaining.]
Bus driver: Back in line, people! Back in line! [the customers continue shouting and Fred holds up a dollar] Exact change only, please!
[Mr. Krabs is not too thrilled with this outcome and his eyestalks explode in anger. Suddenly, the bus crashes through the roof and falls on top of the bus driver. The bus driver crawls out and angrily throws his Krusty Krab work hat to the floor.]
Bus driver: That settles it. I quit everything! [leaves]
[SpongeBob rips through the map and sees that he and the others landed in the Krusty Krab. Squidward peaks his head out through the bus door window.]
Incidental 27: The Krusty Krab Local right on time! One Krabby Patty, please.
Squidward: One Krabby Patty? [gasps] Yes, sir! One Krabby Patty! [taps the cash register]
SpongeBob: [pops out through the bus's exhaust pipe] One Krabby Patty coming up! [pulls himself out and heads to the kitchen]
Squidward: Place your orders, everybody! Because no one can do this job better than me! I win!

Plankton becomes horrified, because he does not want the baby, but Karen states that it is already too late to cancel the order. Plankton tries to prevent the baby from being delivered by having the Chum Bucket Glove fight the stork-shaped drone, but the drone delivering the baby stops him. Karen starts taking care of her new baby and names him Chip after her grandfather, much to the dismay of Plankton. SpongeBob comes along to greet the baby and give compressed air as a present.Karen takes a good care of her baby, while Plankton neglectfully ignores his son. Later, Chip upgrades from baby into toddler, as seen he grows feet and starts walking. Plankton tries to show off by walking himself, but ends up tripping and falling into a nearby trash can. Chip then upgrades and grows up to be a walking handheld payment terminal.Karen brings Chip to the arcade to have fun, but Chip goes inside of a video game to battle the monsters inside. This worries Karen, who tells Chip to get out of the game. Chip does not listen, so Karen grabs the arcade machine and forces Chip out of the game. When he gets out, he upgrades again, this time into a teenager, and curses at his mom for preventing him from playing the game. Karen gets offended by this and angrily drags Chip home. There, she tells Plankton he needs to talk to his son while she cools off. While talking with Chip, Plankton thinks Karen does not get Chip, as he was beating the game very easily. He tells Chip that he should run away, so Chip leaves the Chum Bucket and heads out into the Bikini Bottom streets.Once Chip's gone, Karen arrives and asks Plankton how his conversation with Chip going, which Plankton tells her that he is a good bot. Karen agrees, until she sees no sign of Chip and asks where is he. Plankton tells her that he told him to run away. Karen gets angry at Plankton for telling Chip to run away. Karen explodes in rage and unleashes electronic weapons to physically harm Plankton and tells him he needs to bring him back or else he is not allowed in the Chum Bucket.Meanwhile, Chip meets a robot gang in an alley and wants to join it. However, it turns out they want to take Chip's parts, which frightens him and causes him to try and escape the gang. Plankton, who is searching for Chip via a tank, hears the commotion and heads off to rescue his new son. However, the robots destroy Plankton's tank and chase him around the alley. Chip breaks free from the magnet he got attached to and saves Plankton by using an ice cream machine to defeat the robot gang. The two go back to the Chum Bucket, with Plankton bragging to Karen about how Chip said his name before he said her name. At the same time, Chip upgrades again and has to go to college, causing both Karen and Plankton to cry tears of joy.Eight semesters later, Chip, now adult, is shown working as an ATM at the First Nautical Bank, playing a trick on Mr. Krabs by not letting him get the money he earned. Karen and Plankton are shown to be very proud of their son. Plankton gives his newfound pride towards his son for doing something mischievous and he says: ""That's my boy!"" as the episode ends.",Karen's Baby,"[The episode begins at the Chum Bucket. Karen is pacing back and forth, waiting for something to be delivered. As she paces, her monitor continuously sparks. Karen groans impatiently and numbers scroll on her screen. At that same moment, Plankton comes in.]
Plankton: Karen, I— [gets run over by Karen]
Karen: [gasps] Oh, sorry, Planky-Bear! [picks Plankton up] I'm just a little distracted waiting for our baby to be delivered.
Plankton: Oh, well, that makes sense. [beat] A baby?! I don't want a baby!
Karen: It's too late to stop it now. [shows the marketing website on her monitor] It's been nine months and the baby is no longer on back order. [shows the order button, which clicked into in stock, then scrolls up to show the out for delivery button]
Plankton: Can we ask for store credit instead? [gasps as he sees the stork drone outside]
[The stork drone flies over the Chum Bucket with Karen's baby. The drone rings the doorbell.]
Karen: My baby's here! [laughs]
Plankton: Not if I have anything to say about it.
[Plankton hops onto a computer and activates the Chum Bucket's hand. The hand closes the roof and goes to fight the drone. The drone holds out a laser and zaps the hand away, opening the roof in the process. The drone drops the bundle and Karen's happily catches it. Karen unwraps the bundle to reveal the baby, which happens to be a little calculator.]
Karen: [giggles and happily squeals] Oh, Planky-Poo, look how cute our baby is!
Plankton: Oh, please, that thing isn't even a graphing calculator. Weak.
Karen: Oh, come on. [holds out her baby] How can you look at our baby's itty wittle keyboard and say he's not the cutest? [gasps as an exclamation point shows on her screen] I have the perfect name for him. Well, don't you wanna know the name?
Plankton: Not really.
Karen: It's Chip. [shows the word ""chip"" on her screen, then shows an old computer chip] He's named after my grandfather.
[Chip starts to cry.]
Plankton: [groans] Great, here we go with the crying! Will you please hush that thing up?!
[Karen taps on Chip's buttons and Plankton groans angrily. Suddenly, Chip stops crying.]
Karen: There you go. All better.
Plankton: Wow, how did you do that so fast?
Karen: Simple, I just typed 4-4-4-5 in his cute little keyboard.
Plankton: I don't get it.
Karen: [turns Chip upside-down and the numbers show the word, ""Shhh"" on it.] Shhh.
Plankton: [groans and continues his work] At least it can't get more annoying.
SpongeBob: [giggles as he flies in with a present] Hello! [giggles and a background audience is heard cheering]
[Plankton groans angrily and stomps over to Karen and Chip.]
SpongeBob: [giggles] A little drone told me you two are new parents. So, I just had to bring over a little present for the baby. Hello, baby. [gently rubs Chip's face, making him giggle]
Karen: Oh, I think little Chip likes you.
Plankton: Obviously not the brightest diode in the box.
SpongeBob: Look, Chip, your uncle SpongeBob got you a little something. [opens the present and reveals a can of compressed air] It's a can of compressed air to keep your keys nice and clean, like this! [pushes button and the nozzle flies out, nearly hitting Plankton]
Plankton: Phew.
[The nozzle bounces on the wall and flies back at Plankton, knocking out his eye. SpongeBob giggles, pushes the button on the compressed air can and flies out of the Chum Bucket. The scene changes to Chip, who has appeared to have grown arms and legs, learning how to walk. He goes to walk, but falls down.]
Karen: Come on, walk to Mommy.
[Chip stands up and goes walking to his mother.]
Karen: That's it. You can do it.
[Chip nearly falls down, but continues to walk.]
Karen: You're walking, baby!
Plankton: [chuckles] You call that walking? This is walking. [walks around in place] This is how you do it. This is how it's done.
[Chip goes to walk over to Plankton. When suddenly, Chip's screen shows the word, ""upgrade"" on it.]
Karen: Ah! Mama's big boy is upgrading!
[Chip upgrades himself and grows out of his diaper and becomes a walking calculator. Chip happily runs over to Karen and hugs her.]
Karen: Aw.
[Plankton slips on some long sheet of paper.]
Plankton: Whoa, ah! [flies over to the trashcan filled with Chip's stinky diapers and groans] This stinks!
[The scene changes to Karen taking Chip to the arcade on a stroller.]
Karen: Let's see if we can find some friends for Mama's special little boy. [enters the arcade] You need to interface with someone fun. Try that video game over there. It doesn't look too dangerous.
[Chip hops out of the stroller, opens the video game's door, and enters the game. Chip appears on the video game's screen and jumps onto the submarine. Chip begins to play the game and goes to collect coins. Karen slowly starts to become worried about Chip's safety. Chip then starts to zap various stuff with the submarine's laser.]
Karen: Careful, Chip.
[Chip continues to zap the video game items.]
Karen: Uh, those monsters are too big. Come out of that game right now!
[Chip ignores his mother's warnings and starts to become more violent in the video game.]
Karen: Chip, get out of there!
[Karen knocks on the game's door, but it wouldn't budge open. She grabs the machine and shakes Chip out. Suddenly, the word, ""error"" appears on Chip's screen and Chip upgrades himself into a teenage video game console with a red cap.]
Karen: [laughs] So you think you can do whatever you want because you're a teenager now? [as she's talking, Chip just rolls his eyes and yawns] You just wait until I tell your father.
[Chip makes a loud screeching sound on his screen, indicating that he said a curse word in front of his own mother.]
Karen: What did you just say to me?! [groans angrily as she grabs Chip by the button ears and takes him home]
[The scene changes back to the Chum Bucket. Plankton is still working until Karen comes in with Chip.]
Karen: I told Chip that game was too dangerous, and do you know what he said to me? [makes the same loud screeching noise as red scribbles appear on the screen]
Plankton: And?
Karen: [angrily growls and spins her monitor around] Just talk to your son! I need to cool my circuits. [leaves]
Plankton: [slides himself over to talk to Chip] Ooh, uh, hey, buddy. Heh, what you doing?
Chip: [depressed] Eh…
Plankton: Yeah, I hear you. So, uh, what happened at the arcade?
[Chip mimics every detail of what happened at the arcade. He shows that he was having a fun time playing in one of the videogames by making gun noises. Then he inhales and exhales himself, saying that his mother sucked him out. And then he shows various symbols on his screen with a dolphin sound heard in the background, saying that he said a curse word in front of his mother.]
Plankton: What? Your mother stopped your game, even though you were crushing it? Your mother clearly doesn't get you, man. But I have the perfect solution to your problem. Run away.
Chip: Huh?
Plankton: Yes, I said run away. Take off, see the world. You do you.
[Chip was confused about what Plankton said. But after seeing an image of himself running away, he was happy about it.]
Plankton: Eh, now get out of here, you little scamp.
[Chip gets up and leaves the Chum Bucket. Plankton goes back to his work right when Karen comes back in.]
Karen: So, how was your talk with Chip?
Plankton: Oh, it went great. He's a good boy.
Karen: Yeah, he wh— [notices Chip is missing] Where—where is he?
Plankton: Oh, he ran away.
Karen: What?! Why would my baby run away?
Plankton: Because I told him to. Duh.
[Karen screams in an uncontrollable rage. Her hands gather up green electricity and form into a green rolling pin and a green frying pan. Plankton screams in terror as Karen goes to hurt him. Karen throws the green rolling pin at Plankton, which turns into an electric trident and pins him to the wall.]
Plankton: Karen, baby, let's be reasonable here!
Karen: [picks up the trident holding Plankton] You find our son and bring him home this instant or don't bother coming home! [her green frying pan turns into a spiked glove]
Plankton: [screams as Karen flings him out of the Chum Bucket] I'm going! I'm going!
[The scene changes to Plankton driving in a tank while searching for Chip.]
Plankton: Chip! Chip! Where are you, boy? Come to Daddy! Ugh, what am I saying? Chip! Chip!
[Little did Plankton know, Chip is sitting by himself in a dark alley near a garbage can. Just then, a strange looking machine comes out.]
Weird machine: Psst, hey, kid, you lost?
Chip: [shrugs] Meh.
Weird machine: Running away from home, huh? Cool! Why don't you come hang with me and my buddies? [grabs Chip and pushes him over to meet his friends] Oh, don't be scared. In here. Check it out, guys. I found us a new friend.
[Three other weird machines come out and all look at Chip. They all give him a friendly greeting.]
Weird machine: I know, right? It is cool here. There's just one thing. If you wanna be part of us, we're gonna need your parts.
[Chip turns and sees a machine about to be taken apart.]
Machine #1: Uh-oh. [his monitor is unscrewed]
[One of the machines takes the spare part and puts it on another machine, making it into an arm. The machine giggles happily. Chip beeps in terrible fright and goes to run away.]
Weird machine: [grabs Chip] Oh, come on, kid, don't be like that. We've all done it.
[Chip runs off to escape.]
Weird machine: Get him!
[Chip screams in horror as he tries to escape. One machine takes out a huge magnet and uses it to drag Chip back. Chip tries to fight off the magnetic pull, but ends up getting dragged backwards. He gets stuck onto the magnet and the machines prepare to tear Chip apart. Chip struggles to break free and then lets out a loud screeching sound as a call for help. Meanwhile, Plankton is still driving around, looking for Chip.]
Plankton: Chip! Your mother's gonna kill me if I can't find you. [hears the screeching sound] Huh? [his antennas act up and point in the other direction] That's him! He's in trouble! Don't worry, son! Daddy is coming! [drives the tank around and goes in the direction Chip's call for help is coming from; plows through the wall near the dark alley] Get away from my son! [one machine chops the tank into pieces] Get away from me!
[The machines chase Plankton around.]
Chip: Father! [breaks free from the magnet] Leave my father alone!
Plankton: [Overhearing Chip and touched] Your first word was ""father."" Wait until I rub this in Karen's face. [chuckles as he continues to run]
[Chip hops onto an old ice cream machine and hacks into it, making it his own tank. He then shoots ice cream at the machines, breaking several of them into pieces. He shoots ice cream onto the ground, making one of them slip and break apart.]
Weird machine: No! The delicious horror! [gets sprayed by Chip's ice cream machine] Ah!
[The scene changes back to the Chum Bucket. Plankton and Chip are telling Karen what happened in downtown Bikini Bottom.]
Plankton: Oh, you should've seen it, Karen. Chip was all like, ""Stay away from my daddy, who is the most brilliant, handsome genius in the world.""
Karen: [rolls her eyes in disgust] Oh, brother.
Plankton: [hops onto Chip's monitor, making him drop his ice cream] Aw, we have got the best kid ever!
[Suddenly, Chip starts going through another upgrade. As Chip upgrades, Plankton loses his balance and falls in the ice cream on the floor. Chip upgrades himself into a young adult computer with a backpack.]
Karen: Oh! [giggles] Aw.
Plankton: [pulls himself out of the ice cream] Come on, son, let your old man buy you a quart of oil. [hops onto Chip's screen] Whoo-hoo! [giggles] Yes!
Chip: [removes Plankton from his screen] Sorry, Dad, I'd love to, but I'm leaving for college. [sets Plankton down on Karen's hand]
Plankton: [gets teary-eyed] I went to college. [sobs alongside with Karen as a waterfall appears on her screen]
[Chip exits the Chum Bucket, climbs onto a bus parked to the curb, waves good-bye to his family, and drives off to college.]
French narrator: Eight semesters later...
[The scene changes to the First Nautical Bank. Chip, now a full grown adult, is working as an ATM there. Just then, Mr. Krabs comes in. But little does anyone know that Plankton and Karen are secretly spying on Chip at his first day of his job.]
Plankton: [chuckles before Karen flicks him] Ouch! Watch it, Karen! We don't want Chip to know we're spying on his first day of work.
[Mr. Krabs inserts his credit card and types in the numbers 1234.]
Chip: [scans Mr. Krabs' credit card numbers] Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[Mr. Krabs giggles excitedly and money comes out of Chip's money slot. Mr. Krabs goes to get it, but Chip pulls the money back in. Mr. Krabs does it again, but the money gets pulled back in again. He does it a couple of time, but Chip still wouldn't give Mr. Krabs the money.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, what? [groans while shaking Chip]
[Mr. Krabs bangs on Chip's monitor and goes to grab the money. But discovers that Chip pulled the money back in.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey! [tries to grab the money, but fails when Chip pulls them back] Hey! Give me my money! [sobs]
Plankton: [laughs while Karen smiles with a heart on her screen] That's my boy!",1.09,Ben Gruber

[Inside the medicine cabinet, Plankton squeezes out of the toothpaste tube.]
Plankton: Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee! [talks through walkie-talkie] Fluoride to Desktop, I'm in a position to raise no suspicion, over.
Karen: [through walkie-talkie] Cut the poetry, Wordsworth. Did you get Krabs' hair sample yet?
Plankton: Keep your pants on, woman! I'm gonna steal his hairs right out of his razor. [chuckles as he grabs a razor and goes to take some hair]
[Suddenly, Mr. Krabs opens the cabinet door.]
Mr. Krabs: I'll just grab the razor here... [grabs Plankton]
Plankton: Wait! No! [gets dragged against Mr. Krabs' face with his teeth] Auugh!
[Plankton spits out a hairball of Mr. Krabs' hair.]
Plankton: [coughs] Ehhh! [rubs the hair off his tongue]
[Mr. Krabs holds Plankton up to the shower head and fills his mouth up with water.]
Mr. Krabs: Now for the rest of it. [uses Plankton to shave his back hair]

Karen: Well, if it isn't my thieving husband. So did you bring me the— [sees Plankton's mouth full of hair; she picks it up and removes the hair from Plankton's mouth] Hair? [takes a sample of hair and throws the rest away] I only needed one.
[The scene changes to Plankton leaning on the glass of his machine.]
Plankton: Hee-hee-hee! You married a genius, Karen. Using the DNA of Krabs' hair and my own DNA from my antennae— [his right antenna gets snipped off by Karen] Ouch! [his antenna is placed in the machine] I will create a combo-clone of me and Krabs to finally steal the secret formula! [pulls up the lever and cackles]
[The machine turns itself on and fuses the hair sample and antenna sample together. The cloning machine turns on and creates a single being with Mr. Krabs' and Plankton's DNA together. The being turns into a blob and the machine turns off.]
Plankton: Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Behold PlanKrab!
[The machine opens the door and the being steps out.]

PlanKrab: Arr-arr-arr-arr-arr!
Karen: How is this a good thing?
Plankton: Wake up, Karen! The Plankton side will know everything the Krabs side knows! It'll be easier than taking candy from a baby.
Karen: Mm, and we know how successful that was. [turns on the screen to show Plankton trying to steal a lollipop from a baby, but ends up getting sucked on]
Plankton: This is different! Isn't it, PlanKrab, my pretty? Now, here's my plan.
PlanKrab: Don't waste your breath, Plankteron. I already mapped out the perfect plot to swipe that formuler-ererer!

Plankton: B-b-but how?!
PlanKrab: All it took, me hearty, was a hearty handshake. The world's persuasive handshake, that is! [holds his hand out] It's me latest creation. Put her there-erer, matey.
Plankton: An evil handshake. That's hands down the dumbest thing I ever— [puts his hand on PlanKrab's hand] Huh? [feels tiny hands giving his hand nice, gentle massages and spa treatments] Oh. Ooh. Heh-heh, yeah. Oh, ooh, ahh, ahh. Yeah, yeah. Ahh! Yeah. Ohh-ho-ho! [lets go of PlanKrab's hand] Oh, your handshake is exquisite! I'd believe anything you say.
PlanKrab: [turns Plankton around] Then believe this, swabby. [steals Plankton's deed to the Chum Bucket] I'll also be commandeer-ering the Chum Bucket from now on.
Plankton: Ahh—ahh. Sounds great to me, P.K.
PlanKrab: And I'm afraid your services are no longer required-ererered! [throws Plankton in the air]
Plankton: Gosh, I still can't get over this handshake. [gets booted out of the Krusty Krab and is sent flying in Mr. Krabs' coffee mug] I'm over it now.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps upon seeing Plankton in his mug] Plankton! [sets Plankton down] Some creepy one-eyed crab took me restaurant! [sobs really hard]
Plankton: Wait a minute. I think he took mine too! [sobs alongside Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: I-I-I don't know what happened. But that was some handshake of his, huh? I mean...hoo—hoo!
Plankton: Snap out of the handshake! It's a trick, Krabs! [slaps Mr. Krabs in the face] A dirty, beautiful trick!
[Suddenly, a truck with a crane comes by. It implants something on the top of the Krusty Krab. The cover pulls itself up and reveals to be the Chum Bucket. Only this time, it says Krusty Bucket in place of the word, ""Chum."" The sign opens to reveal the word, ""The Krusty Bucket."" Plankton and Mr. Krabs scream in terror upon what they're seeing. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs and Plankton eavesdropping on the Krusty Bucket to see what PlanKrab is doing.]

Mr. Krabs: He may have taken our restaurants, but we'll take his customers!
[Fred sees signs that says the Krusty Bucket is closed and are pointing to something else in another direction. Fred walks over to Mr. Krabs and Plankton's stand, buys a patty, and leaves. Mr. Krabs and Plankton chuckle, thinking they've won.]
PlanKrab: [holding a drive-thru sign but points it to Plankton and Mr. Krabs] This way! Drive-thru! Literally.
[Mr. Krabs and Plankton get run over by a passing truck. PlanKrab then heads back into the Krusty Krab.]
Plankton: All right, all right! I can't go any lower, Eugene! Please make it stop!
Mr. Krabs: [picks Plankton up] It looks like there's only one way out of this one, Sheldon.
Plankton: Oh, no! You don't mean...
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. I'm afraid so.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs and Plankton sitting in PlanKrab's office. SpongeBob is acting as a moving fan for PlanKrab.]
PlanKrab: That'll be all for now, Spongematey.
SpongeBob: Oh, could I just have one more handshake, Captain?
PlanKrab: [chuckles] Sure as yer born. [gives SpongeBob the soothing handshake]
SpongeBob: Ooh…. [melts and slithers back into the kitchen]
PlanKrab: So you two scallywags want to work for me, eh?
Mr. Krabs and Plankton: I wanna be the manager! [both growl angrily]
PlanKrab: Well, you're both in luck. It just so happens I'm looking for two new manager-erers…
Mr. Krabs: Ahh!
Plankton: Yeah!
[The scene changes into the Krusty Krab restrooms. PlanKrab gives Mr. Krabs and Plankton working hats and toilet brushes.]
PlanKrab: To manage me toilets! [chuckles and leaves]
Mr. Krabs: [removes the hat] Well, here's another fine mess you've gotten us into.
Plankton: [whimpers and coughs] Hair.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs and Plankton scrubbing the toilets with toilet brushes.]
Plankton: The humiliation in here stinks!
Mr. Krabs: This is all your fault, Plankton. I'm gonna keel haul yer face at lunchtime!
Plankton: Why wait? Let's take a coffee break! [throws a coffee maker onto Mr. Krabs] Pow!
[Mr. Krabs' eyes pour out of the coffee maker. Mr. Krabs grabs Plankton and pushes him against a fast-moving toilet paper roll.] [Plankton pushes Mr. Krabs into the toilet and gives him a swirly flush.]
Plankton: [laughs] Swirly!
[Mr. Krabs pulls himself out of the toilet and is all twisted. Mr. Krabs and Plankton then get into a massive brawl. One customer, Administrator Flotsam, is hearing the commotion from the other side.]
Administrator Flotsam: Hey, I'm trying to read! [Mr. Krabs and Plankton plows through the curtain] Ahh! Hey! [gets caught up in the brawl]
[Outside, PlanKrab is giving Squidward the soothing handshake. Squidward happily faints into his register boat.]
Administrator Flotsam: [runs out of the restroom] Two guys...fighting...toilet paper everywhere! [runs away]
PlanKrab: [gets angry and pulls up his sleeve] Oh, yeah? [kicks the restroom door open and enters] Who's defiling me rester-ereroom?!
[The doors fall down and sees Plankton and Mr. Krabs fighting on the toilet.]
Plankton: He did it!
Mr. Krabs: He did it!
Mr. Krabs and Plankton: No, he did it! No, he did it! No, he did it! [continuously bickering]
[PlanKrab gets so confused at what he's getting at, when all of a sudden, his head splits into half. One head is Green PlanKrab and the other head is Red PlanKrab.]
Green PlanKrab: Get off of him, Plankton!
Red PlanKrab: It was obviously Krabs' fault!
Green PlanKrab: Why are you siding with Plankton?!
Red PlanKrab: Why are you siding with Krabs?!
Plankton: They're arguing!
Mr. Krabs: And splitting up!
Green PlanKrab: Stop hitting myself! [hits Red PlanKrab]
Red PlanKrab: Ow! [hits Green PlanKrab] Stop hitting myself! I'm sick of you! [bashes into each other's heads]
Green PlanKrab: What in Neptune's name is wrong with meself?!
[The two heads keep on fighting and going on each other's throats with their arguing.]
Mr. Krabs: Jeez, is that what we sound like?
Plankton: I hope not, 'cause that's pathetic.
Green PlanKrab and Red PlanKrab: [continuously hitting each other] I can't stop hitting myself, because I'm torn!
[Green PlanKrab and Red PlanKrab split into two separate beings. They both growl angrily each other until Mr. Krabs and Plankton came in their referee outfits and break them up while blowing whistles.]
Mr. Krabs: All right, you clones, I want a clean fight. No rough stuff. Go back to your corners when the bell rings and come out fighting.
Plankton: But first, you gotta shake hands.
Green PlanKrab: Well, fine.
[Green PlanKrab and Red PlanKrab give each a handshake. And, at the same time, they end up getting the same massage and spa treatment that the original PlanKrab gave out earlier. Green PlanKrab chuckles warmly.]
Red PlanKrab: Wow, this is a great handshake.
[Green PlanKrab and Red PlanKrab both melt into puddles on the floor, leaving nothing but their severed hands.]
Plankton: Splitting? So soon?
[Mr. Krabs and Plankton laughs heartily.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you. [laughs]
Plankton: [coughs] Hair.
Mr. Krabs: Here, me bucko. Let me get that for ya. [steps on Plankton to cough out a hairball]

At the same time, Patrick catches the painting when it is thrown away by the art critic and later reveals to Squidward that he is the museum's security guard. This makes Squidward understand that since the security is awful, he can hang his painting in the museum with ease.Patrick appoints SpongeBob to junior guard and gives him a tour of many of the exhibits of the museum as well as what rules he needs to enforce. While Patrick is giving SpongeBob the tour, Squidward goes inside the museum through a window to put his painting. He almost gets caught several times, but successfully puts the painting up.Unfortunately, SpongeBob and Patrick see Squidward with the painting and think he is stealing it. They chase him through the museum and eventually catch him. The episode ends with Squidward's painting being put up on the museum, making Squidward happy (and somehow the Squidward in the painting as well), despite getting arrested by the police.",Insecurity Guards,"[The episode begins at the Bikini Bottom Museum of Everything. Squidward is at the front doors, showing an art critic his latest painting.]
Squidward: Well, what do you think? Do you love it?
Art critic: Mr. Tentacles, I simply cannot express my true feelings about your work!
Squidward: Yes, I realize my artistic brilliance [eyebrows twitch] can be overwhelming.
Art critic: Quite frankly... [sniffs the painting] It stinks! [turns the painting to reveal a picture of a sad-looking Squidward with his clarinet]
Squidward: Yes, and—what?! Now, see here! Maybe this ""museum"" is too low-brow for this masterpiece.
Art critic: [gasps] How dare you! [slaps Squidward for his offensive remark] Be gone! [smacks him down the stairs with his painting] And take your putrid painting with you! It has no place in this museum's art collection!
[The art critic catapults the painting off the museum's limits.]
Squidward: Won't anyone save my precious painting?!
[The painting lands in Patrick's butt.]
Patrick: Got it!
Squidward: Why couldn't it have been anyone else? Give me that! [pulls the painting out of Patrick's butt] What are you doing here?!
SpongeBob: Patrick is the museum's new security guard! And he's giving me a guided tour.
[Patrick sees that his body is backwards. He turns it around to make it just right.]
Squidward: Him? Security?! [scoffs] Ha! This museum's dumber than I thought. [thinking] Hold on, Squidward, if that pointy-headed pea brain is the security guard for this place, then I could sneak my artwork into the museum!
SpongeBob: [appears out of Squidward's head] Sneak what into a where?
Patrick: [appears out of Squidward's head] Think louder, Squidward! You're mumbling!
Squidward: Get out of my head! [shakes SpongeBob and Patrick out of his head; Patrick has Squidward's brain in his mouth; Squidward takes his brain back from Patrick] Give me that! [leaves]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Bye!
SpongeBob: Bon voyage!
Patrick: Keep making pretty pictures!
SpongeBob: We're gonna miss you!
[Bubble transition to Patrick leading SpongeBob into the museum's locker room.]
Patrick: The first exhibit on our tour is... [opens the door and green fumes are everywhere]
SpongeBob: Whoa!
Patrick: The employee locker room!
SpongeBob: Wow! Your life is so glamorous! [puts an underwear with red hearts on his head]
Patrick: You could be my junior assistant!
SpongeBob: Really?!
Patrick: Sure. There's a ton of uniforms in these metal boxes! Check it out! Let me just get my key. [digs into his bellybutton, pulls out a crowbar and pries the locker open] Put this on! [tosses SpongeBob a security uniform]
SpongeBob: Okay! [swallows the uniform and switches it with his regular clothes] Well, how do I look?
Patrick: Guard-tastic!
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick in the middle of the museum. Tourists are looking at paintings, sculptures, and ancient artifacts.]
Patrick: Now, rule number one of guarding is, don't let visitors touch stuff. [pokes SpongeBob's eyes as an example]
SpongeBob: No touchy, no feely. [pops his eyes back out] Eye-eye. [writes it down on his clipboard]
Patrick: Rule number B: no running!
[SpongeBob writes it down on his clipboard. Just then, children run over SpongeBob and Patrick to see the next artwork. An old and tired man walks by.]
Art curator: Single file, children, single file.
[The children run off to see the next artwork.]
Patrick: But stampeding is just fine. [he and SpongeBob stand back up] And the most important rule of all is, [takes SpongeBob's clipboard] don't let visitors steal stuff! If you see anybody suspicious, [a robber walks by] you give them the ol' stink eye!
[The robber prepares to steal a piece of art. But Patrick leans in closer to the robber. He opens his eyes with onions as pupils. The pupils leave out a putrid smell, which causes the robber to faint.]
Patrick: Now you try!
[SpongeBob pulls up his pants and walks over to the robber.]
Robber: [stands back up] Whew! [screams as SpongeBob leans closes to him]
[SpongeBob tries to make his pupils smell like onions. But instead, they become delicious cupcakes. The pupils give off a sweet smell and it makes the robber happy.]
Robber: Mmmm. Ooh, delicious. [takes the piece of art and happily skips away while giggling]
SpongeBob: Ohh….
Patrick: You'll get there, pal.
[Bubble transition to Patrick showing SpongeBob the historic section of the museum. It is filled with skeletons of cave people and prehistoric animals.]
SpongeBob: Ooh….
Patrick: Behold, SpongeBob. Before laughter, there was the pre-hysterical period. [takes the skeleton's arm and flosses his teeth]
Shubie: [gasps] Oh, look, honey!
[Shubie sees the painting of the sponge evolution. But they were unaware that SpongeBob is not from the painting.]
Nat Peterson: What an excellent example of the primitive security guard era. [takes a picture with his camera]
Patrick: [jumps in between] Ooh! I almost forgot rule number fourth! No flash photography! [snatches the camera, which scares Nat and Shubie away] And that is everything I know about being a security guard.
[Patrick eats and swallows the camera. He belches and flashes a bright light in SpongeBob's face. A picture of SpongeBob comes out of Patrick's mouth. SpongeBob is fazed by the camera's flash and takes the picture from Patrick's mouth.]
Patrick: [shakes his head to recover from the flash] Now, I'll teach you everything I don't know. [crickets chirp in background as he sees SpongeBob motionless and pushes him forward] Right this way.
[Patrick takes SpongeBob to the other part of the historic section.]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! An extinct wooly mollusk! [sees a display of the wooly mollusk, elephant trumpets] Aw, this little guy looks like my Gary. [morphs his head into Gary] Meow. [morphs back to normal] Too bad we aren't allowed to touch anything.
Patrick: [scoffs] SpongeBob, the rules don't apply to us. We're security!
SpongeBob: Hooray!
[SpongeBob climbs onto the wooly mollusk display and plays around under its fur. SpongeBob makes an angel with the fur. Patrick pushes the button and it makes the wooly mollusk's eyes glow. But that doesn't amuse Patrick very much.]
Patrick: Is that it? Come on. [pushes button harder] Do something! [growls and pants like a wild animal and keeps on banging the button] Why! Won't! You! Work!
[The wooly mollusk unexpectedly comes to life. It sucks SpongeBob and Patrick through its trunk and blows them out. SpongeBob and Patrick are sent crashing into one of the skeletons and they land in a different section of the museum.]
Patrick: And here we see the ancient junk of the great empire of Pat-Lantis!
[The screen pulls out to reveal that the section had many different pieces of art that feature Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick walk over to a statue holding the Earth on his back.]
SpongeBob: Ooh…. [whistles]
Patrick: Hm? Hey! No touching the exhibits, buddy! [jumps on the statue and breaks the arm off]
[The stone Earth rolls over to an ancient temple and crashes into it. The temple crumbles and it creates a statue of Patrick thinking while sitting on the toilet. The statue notices that he is being looked at and pulls the curtains so no one would see. Patrick realized his horrible mistake of destroying the statue and tries to put the arm back together with his saliva.]
Patrick: Sorry about that, mister.
[The statue's arm hits Patrick on his head. Patrick and SpongeBob tumble over to an ancient mummy's tomb.]
SpongeBob: Huh? Oh, look, Patrick! A mummy!
Patrick: Mummy! Aww! [hugs the tomb]
SpongeBob: Uh, no, Patrick. It's not your mother—
Patrick: Love your new look! How's dad?
SpongeBob: Never mind.
[Suddenly, the children come running in. Patrick opens the tomb and traps the children inside.]
SpongeBob: Will those kids be okay in there?
Patrick: Oh, sure. Mummy loves kids! [the art curator comes by] I think this is yours. [leaves with SpongeBob]
[The art curator opens the tomb and the children run out.]
Art curator: Single file, children. [the mummy falls on him]
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter the next part of the museum. It has many different paintings, sculptures and pottery made by famous people.
SpongeBob: Ooh. Ooh. Oo-oo-ooh.
Patrick: Ooh!
[Patrick stops and sees an art restorer cleaning a painting that features Mr. Krabs, his money, and a Krabby Patty. SpongeBob and Patrick peak through the magnifying glass.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whatcha doin'?!
Art restorer: [gasps] I'm cleaning centuries of dirt from this priceless painting.
Patrick: Going too slow!
SpongeBob: I think I know how we can speed things along!
Patrick: [pushes the art restorer aside] Please stand back for your own safety.
[Patrick picks up SpongeBob and attempts to clean the painting. But instead, they wash the painting away.]
Patrick: Here you go!
[The art restorer is deeply shocked that SpongeBob and Patrick destroyed a priceless painting. Her glasses shatter into pieces. SpongeBob and Patrick turn and leave. The art restorer takes the destroyed painting and forms it into a window. She opens the window, climbs out and runs away frantically. Squidward, disguised as an artist, appears.]
Squidward: Now to hang my masterpiece. Uh-huh.
[Squidward looks around and breaks into the museum by climbing through the open window. Squidward chuckles evilly until he sees SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Squidward: Huh? [hides behind a painting of a seahorse, revealing his butt outside]
SpongeBob: Ooh! I didn't know they had pin the tail on the sea-donkey!
Patrick: This place has everything!
[SpongeBob and Patrick put on blindfolds and hold out pins with a toy donkey tail. They go to pin Squidward's butt until they hear a flash from a camera.]
Patrick: Hey! No flash photography!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run off to stop the photographer. Squidward comes out from his hiding place.]
Squidward: Whew! [chuckles evilly as he proceeds to hang his painting]
[Squidward sees SpongeBob and Patrick coming back and hides behind the painting again. SpongeBob and Patrick pin the donkey tails on Squidward's butt. Squidward screams and the seahorse painting comes to life as it brays like a donkey.]
Squidward: Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
SpongeBob: The winner! [sees a robber stealing a statue] Did you see that guy?
Patrick: Yeah! No running allowed! Let's get him!
[SpongeBob and Patrick chase after the robber. Squidward comes out of his hiding place.]
Squidward: [pulls the pins out of his butt] Hee-haw! [silence] Ah! They're finally gone! [chuckles evilly as he runs over to some paintings]
[Squidward checks to see if the cost is clear. He removes a painting that features Mrs. Puff and throws it in the trash can. The painting's smile turns into a frown. SpongeBob and Patrick come back after they captured the robber. They catch Squidward trying to hang his painting on the wall.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick? I think that guy's trying to—
Patrick: Touch that painting!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run over to Squidward. The robber shrugs and proceeds in stealing more art.]
Squidward: Uh-oh! [runs off with his painting]
Patrick: And now he's stealing it!
[SpongeBob and Patrick chase Squidward through the museum. SpongeBob imitates a siren sound while riding on Patrick's back. Squidward finds himself backed into a dead end.]
Squidward: Oh, no. Dead end!
[SpongeBob and Patrick look around to find Squidward. Squidward blends into one of the paintings to hide. Once the cost is clear, he comes back out of the painting while accidentally destroying it. SpongeBob and Patrick spot Squidward and run after him once more.]
Patrick: Stop, thief!
[SpongeBob and Patrick chase Squidward down the hallway. Squidward snickers as he believes that he's losing sight of SpongeBob and Patrick. But he suddenly realizes that he isn't looking where he was going as he crashed into the mummy's tomb. SpongeBob and Patrick open the tomb and see Squidward all wrapped up.]
SpongeBob: Looks like this case is all wrapped up.
Patrick: Thank you, Mummy.
Mummy: Anytime, sweetie.
[Just as they were about to arrest Squidward for his crimes, SpongeBob and Patrick notices that he escaped from the mummy's wraps and see him running away. SpongeBob and Patrick chase Squidward down another hallway.]
Patrick: We're never gonna catch him!
SpongeBob: Ooh! The wooly mollusk! [pulls the button off the control panel, hops on the mollusk's back with Patrick, and pushes the button]
Patrick: [kicks the wooly mollusk's shell] Hi-ya!
[The wooly mollusk comes back to life and lets out a mighty roar. The wooly mollusk begins to move. However, it is moving slower than faster.]
SpongeBob: [attempts to tap the wooly mollusk with his feet to speed up] Come on.
[Squidward makes it to the museum's nearest exit.]
Squidward: [pants] Ha, ha! Too slow!
[Suddenly, children run over Squidward and run out the exit.]
Art curator: Single file, children. [steps on Squidward while walking out through the exit] Single file.
[The robber runs out through the exit with pieces of art, stepping on Squidward in the process. The wooly mollusk comes by. SpongeBob and Patrick slide down its trunk and land on Squidward.]
Patrick: [talks into walkie-talkie] We've secured the purple-tater, over.
[Bubble transition to the exterior of the museum. Inside, the police lady arrests Squidward for breaking into the museum and vandalizing artwork. SpongeBob hangs up Squidward's painting on the wall.]
Squidward: Hmm?
SpongeBob: There! Back where you belong. [leaves]
Squidward: [mumbles] It's beautiful!
Lady officer: You actually like that eyesore?
Squidward: Why, it's the greatest painting I've ever seen...hanging in the museum! [laughs like a crazed maniac]
Lady officer: [creeped out by Squidward's crazed laughter] Okay, that's enough, weirdo. [takes Squidward away so she can turn him in for his crimes]

[The magic trick starts when the kelp forest turns into a white screen as SpongeBob turns into magic playing cards, which then transform into a buzzsaw and cut a copy of SpongeBob in-half, and then a rainbow appears. Then ten cut in half/rainbow-colored SpongeBobs, two green, two yellow, two pink, two red, and two blue, each holding one magic playing card start running out as the rainbow disappears. Then, two other SpongeBobs, one on the bottom of the screen, and the other on top of the screen being upside down, start leading a bunch of card people from the top, and the bottom of the screen. Then, two other card people start going over and under each other five times, becoming SpongeBob, and back to a playing card. Then the camera zooms out to see lots of card people on the screen, which then fade to SpongeBob. wearing a magician's outfit, a magic hat on top of his head, and a magic wand for a nose, which automatically makes some flowers come out of it, The Great Spongedini then takes the magic wand out of his nose and turns it into three metal rings, that are linked to each other. Then, The Great Spongedini puts himself through the rings, and then, the rings transform into a cannon that shoots out three colorful fireworks. One pink, one yellow, and one blue. Then, The Great Spongedini appears on the screen again, and then notices a red ribbon stuck through his left sleeve.]
The Great Spongedini: Huh? [The Great Spongedini pulls the ribbon out of his left sleeve, but then reveals a red, blue, pink, green, and orange ribbon that covers the whole screen. Then the scene becomes spirally and gets put into a magic hat. Then, the white screen turns back to the kelp forest and SpongeBob pulls himself out of the magic hat in a pink bunny suit, ending his magic trick.]
SpongeBob: ♪ Ta-dah! ♪ [notices that the audience he made was fake and didn't respond to his magic trick.] Oh... I still wish Patrick was here to see it. [then he notices Patrick sitting on a mushroom, hanging onto another mushroom.]
Patrick: [off-screen] I saw it, SpongeBob! [on-screen] It was astonishable! [Patrick falls of the mushroom and falls flat onto the ground, and pulls himself off the ground.]
SpongeBob: [hugging Patrick] Oh, Patrick! You showed up just in time! What was your favorite part?
Patrick: Uh... My favorite part was... uh... ""♪ Ta-dah! ♪"" I missed everything before that.
SpongeBob: Oh, then you haven't seen seen anything yet! [he grabs a hold of Patrick's hand. The two spin around and then they disappear into a magic hat. Some confetti and a card come out of the hat as the two laugh. Fireworks also start coming out of the hat, while the rock creatures stand inanimate.]",0.89,Doug Lawrence

He sees that it is raining outside and asks himself why it is raining if Gale Doppler said it would be sunny skies. The rain turns out to be from the baby storm cloud, so SpongeBob decides to take him under his wing. He names the cloud Drizzle and the two start doing many activities together.One day, he ties Drizzle onto a fence and tells him he cannot go inside the house until he is housebroken, due to Gary not being fond of him. While he brings him his food, the cloud escapes and starts causing havoc on Bikini Bottom. Gale Doppler notices this and tries to suck up Drizzle so his prediction about the weather can stay true.SpongeBob goes looking for Drizzle and eventually finds him. He thanks Gale Doppler for finding him, but he says he needs to suck up the cloud, as it is a danger to the public, so the two use reef blowers to get Drizzle. SpongeBob has a kid handle the reef blower, allowing him to grab the cloud. While he is escaping, Drizzle gets pulled in by Gale Doppler using a large reef blower attached to a construction machine.He begs him to let go of Drizzle, while crying out tears that make Drizzle bigger. The skies turn gray and Drizzle goes inside Gale Doppler's body, turning him into a storm cloud. He likes this as first, but realizes the damages caused to him and wants to go back to normal. He eventually hits the parent clouds of Drizzle, who make him come out of Gale. He asks about the clouds, but they blow him into the dehumidifier he was going to use on Drizzle and explodes. The cloud family leaves, but Drizzle gives off a smaller cloud for SpongeBob to keep, as the episode ends.",Stormy Weather,"[The episode begins on a stormy night in Bikini Bottom. Above the city, two clouds come to life as the sun rises.]
Cloud father: [yawns and looks at his watch] Whoa. [wakes up his cloud wife] Hmm. [points to their next destination]
Cloud mother: Oh!
[The two clouds float away, but they accidentally left a small baby cloud behind. The baby cloud wakes up from its slumber.]
Drizzle: Huh? [whimpers and sees neither of his parents] Ma? Pa? [cries a small rainfall over the town]
Gale Doppler: I'm Gale Doppler with the big weather! Well, just as I predicted, those severe thunderstorms are moving to the southeast, and I guarantee it's gonna be nothing but sunny skies for the rest of the week. [takes off his raincoat to reveal his summer attire] This is Gale Doppler, and I broadcast the forecast that's never wrong! [reveals to be on TV] Heh, heh.
SpongeBob: [running on the treadmill] Huh? [gets tangled up in the treadmill] Whoa-boing! [crashes into the wall] Hah! Sunny skies all week? [his eyes become yellow like the sun] Hot diggity! [runs to the window, but to his surprise, he sees rain falling; his eyes then turn black] Rain. [grabs a photo of Gale Doppler] But-but Gale Doppler is never wrong. Huh? Hm.
[SpongeBob runs outside to check to see if it is raining.]
SpongeBob: [mumbles] What...? [sees a waterfall of rain] Hm? [looks up and sees the baby cloud crying] Aw, it's a little baby storm cloud. Hello, little cloud. Nice to meet you.
Drizzle: [crying]
SpongeBob: Oh, you're crying. I thought you were raining.
Drizzle: Huh? [hides behind one of the pineapple's leaves]
SpongeBob: Oh, now don't be scared. SpongeBob knows just what a growing storm cloud needs. [brings in a pot of steaming hot water] Hot steam. Mwah! [kisses, sets the pot down and goes back into his house]
[The baby cloud comes out from the leaves on the roof and slurps down the hot water. SpongeBob watches the cloud in the water from inside his house. He comes back out through the front door.]
Drizzle: Huh? [hides behind the house]
SpongeBob: Well, okay, I don't see any clouds, so I'm just gonna take a walk.
Drizzle: Huh?
SpongeBob: [whistles as the baby cloud casts a shadow over him] Tut-tut, it looks like rain. Hah! [the baby cloud disappears before reappearing in front of him] Oh, hello there. [the baby cloud licks SpongeBob like a dog] Aw, who's a cute cumulous? [hugs the baby cloud] I always wanted to have a pet cloud formation. I gonna name you... [gets sprayed in the face by the baby cloud; gasps] Drizzle. [giggles as Drizzle floats around him and plays with him]
[Drizzle picks up SpongeBob and shows the viewing of Bikini Bottom.]
SpongeBob: Hey, good visibility!
[Drizzle absorbs SpongeBob into his cloud body and rains him down to the ground. SpongeBob laughs and Drizzle blows a gust of wind in his face. Drizzle's wind causes SpongeBob to lose his pants.]
SpongeBob: [imitating Gale Doppler] And gusty winds from the southeast.
[SpongeBob and Drizzle laugh. Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Drizzle playing in Jellyfish Fields. SpongeBob is laying on the ground and Drizzle is forming shapes for SpongeBob to guess. Drizzle forms into a boat.]
SpongeBob: Um. A clam eating a telephone.
[Drizzle forms into something off-screen.]
SpongeBob: A fur chandelier!
[Drizzle forms into a boot.]
SpongeBob: A lamp!
[Drizzle forms into a treasure chest.]
SpongeBob: A shoe factory!
[Drizzle forms into a globe.]
SpongeBob: A continental breakfast!
Drizzle: Ooh. [forms into a dog]
SpongeBob: A chicken!
Drizzle: [moves its mouth but clucks like a chicken instead of barking like a dog]
SpongeBob: Oh, I am so good at this.
[Raindrop transition to SpongeBob taking Drizzle for a walk. They both stop at a fire hydrant and run into a civilian who is walking his worm. Both Drizzle and the worm snarl at each other. The worm barks ferociously. But Drizzle lets out a blast of cold ice from his mouth, freezing the worm and its owner.]
SpongeBob: Sorry. Ee...
[SpongeBob and Drizzle continue walking as the civilian and his worm crumble into ice particles.]
SpongeBob: Bad Drizzle. Bad. [Drizzle nuzzles up against SpongeBob] Well, all right, not that bad. Okay, let's go home. [hops on Drizzle's back and rides home]
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob tying Drizzle to a pole outside his house.]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Drizzle, but you can't go in the house until you're housebroken.
[Gary is looking out the bedroom window and is all wet from Drizzle's rain.]
Gary: [closes the blinds] Meow.
SpongeBob: I'll check on you later. [goes back into the house]
[Drizzle struggles to break free from the pole, but it is no use. So, it creates thunderbolts and burns the pole to a crisp.]
Drizzle: Whoo-hoo! [flies away]
SpongeBob: It's later! [holds out a bowl of hot water] Who wants a steaming hot bowl of steam? [sees Drizzle gone] Ah! Drizzle! [the bowl of hot water falls on his head] Yow! Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot! Where art thou, Drizzle? Oh, what unfortunate forecast be this? [sees Drizzle flying away, crying] Oh, wait. There he goes. Come back, Drizzle! Come back! [follows Drizzle]
[Drizzle is in the middle of Bikini Bottom's intersection, dodging incoming boats left and right.]
Drizzle: Whoa!
Mary: Oh, get off the road!
[A truck hits Drizzle and sends him spinning. Another truck sends Drizzle spinning into a random pet store. When he comes out from the pet store, he turned gray and rained snails and worms similar to the phrase ""raining cats and dogs."" The citizens run in panic as snails and worms fall on them.]
Nat Peterson: [covered in snails and worms] It's raining snails and worms! [trips over Gale Doppler and runs off]
Gale Doppler: [takes off his sunglasses and pulls out his microphone] That's impossible! I called for sunny skies and for 35 years I broadcast the forecast that's never wrong. [snails and worms fall on him]
[The snail and worm begin fighting each other and Gale is getting pummeled by them. Nat comes back and takes the microphone.]
Nat Peterson: This just in: Gale Doppler is wrong ! [removes a worm from his head and puts it on Gale's head before leaving]
Gale Doppler: [laughs awkwardly] Huh? [turns and sees Drizzle causing mayhem in town]
[Drizzle is zapping thunderbolts at everyone and blows them all around.]
Gale Doppler: [rips off his summer attire] Ah! I see the trouble now, folks. That is what they call an unpredictable storm front. [Drizzle turns back to normal and flies away] But don't worry. [pulls out a leaf blower and turns it to suck] I'm gonna suck him right out of the sky to save my reputation, after these messages.
Debbie Rechid: Are you constipated? Sure, we all are. [holds up a plunger contraption] Thank goodness there's new—
SpongeBob: [interrupts the commercial] Drizzle! Drizzle, where are you? Excuse me. Have you seen a little storm cloud about yea big?
[Drizzle continues running around town and tries to hide from Gale Doppler. Drizzle hide behind a billboard, hoping that Gale would never find him. However, Gale finds him and sucks him in his leaf blower.]
Gale Doppler: I got him! Naughty nimbus, nobody messes with my flawless forecasts. It's back to sunny skies for Bikini Bottom. [prepares to blast Drizzle away, but SpongeBob passes by]
SpongeBob: Drizzle! Drizzle! Drizzle! [finds Drizzle in Gale's leaf blower] Oh, there you are, Drizzle. [gasps as his irises' light reflections turn into stars] Gale Doppler! [shakes his hand] You're my favorite well-eyed weather man! Oh, thanks for finding my lost pet, Mr. Doppler. Time to go home, Drizzle.
Gale Doppler: I'm sorry, square face. This cloud is a danger to the public. And I'm sending him straight to cloud heaven. [turns on the leaf blower and blows Drizzle away, but sucks him back; he laughs] I'm Gale Doppler, and I control the weather. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Hey, Doppler. [appears to have his own leaf blower] You're not the only one who knows how to use a leaf blower, sucker. [turns on his leaf blower and sucks Drizzle out of Gale's]
[SpongeBob and Gale go out on a little tug of war with Drizzle using their leaf blowers. Just then, a kid comes in. SpongeBob gives the kid his leaf blower and takes Drizzle. SpongeBob runs to a corner to hide from Gale. SpongeBob then disguises Drizzle as a wig so they could fool Gale as he runs by. But that didn't fool him at all. He sees through SpongeBob's disguise and prepares to suck Drizzle. But SpongeBob activates his leaf blower inside Drizzle and blows away.]
SpongeBob: We did it, Drizzle. We put a stoppler to the doppler. And I predict sunny skies for the rest of our lives.
[Drizzle gets pulled away by something and SpongeBob falls into a mailbox in the street.]
Drizzle: Huh?
[Drizzle is being sucked by an even bigger leaf blower attached to a construction machine operated by Gale Doppler.]
Gale Doppler: Ooh! That's a nasty low pressure system from the north!
[SpongeBob comes out of the mailbox and coughs up random letters and a package. Drizzle cries out for help as he is being sucked in the machine even further. SpongeBob runs over to Gale Doppler and falls to his knees.]
SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Doppler, don't send Drizzle to cloud heaven!
Gale Doppler: That's just an expression. He's not going anywhere.
SpongeBob: Phew, that's a relief.
Gale Doppler: [moves the machine over the dehumidifier] I'm gonna drop him in this dehumidifier and dissolve him.
Drizzle: [screams]
SpongeBob: Dissolve him?! What?! [hops onto Gale's head and holds his eyes shut] Please, Mr. Doppler! Drizzle's a good cloud! He doesn't deserve to dissolve! [cries a fountain of tears]
Gale Doppler: I've got zero visibility. Let go of my eyes, square face!
[SpongeBob's tears fall onto Drizzle into the sucker.]
SpongeBob: [sobs] Drizzle!
[Suddenly, SpongeBob's tears cause Drizzle to grow bigger and turn gray. Drizzle's growth breaks the sucker. Gale finally gets to remove SpongeBob off his face. He turns around and sees Drizzle forming thunderbolts and blowing winds. SpongeBob gets up and nervously runs away, sensing that Gale made him mad.]
Gale Doppler: I'm in the middle of a severe thunderstorm— [gets hit by a stop sign from the extremely powerful windstorm] And we're bringing it to you li—
[Drizzle blows the microphone into his cloud body. Drizzle zaps Gale, and flies right in his mouth and into his body. Gale is lifted in the air and he coughs up the microphone.]
Gale Doppler: I'm Gale Doppler, and I actually am the weather! [laughs, but thunder rumbles in his body and rain falls; it appears that Drizzle is now taking control of Gale's body and is making him do what he what him to do] Huh? Uh-oh.
SpongeBob: Uh-oh. [pulls his right leg and makes an umbrella]
[Drizzle floats Gale back into town and makes him blow wind everywhere. Drizzle then makes Gale's body freeze.]
Gale Doppler: [shivers and freezes] My body is cold!
[Drizzle makes Gale create a blanket of snow over the town.]
Gale Doppler: I don't want to be the weather anymore. It hurts! [Drizzle produces thunder and lightning in Gale's body, making him wail in pain]
SpongeBob: [comes out through the roof of one of the buildings] Excuse me, Drizzle. I don't mean to parade on your rain, but could you please put Gale down?
[A gust of wind blows SpongeBob into the sky.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! [screams and lands on top of a bigger storm cloud; he gets up and sees two bigger storm clouds] Huh? Oh, no! Not more storm clouds.
Gale Doppler: [as Drizzle makes him fly around] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
[The two bigger storm clouds create a loud thunder to get Drizzle to stop.]
Gale Doppler: No!
[Drizzle turns Gale around and comes out from his mouth.]
Drizzle: What? [sees his cloud parents and laughs] Aw. [flies over to his cloud parents and hugs them]
SpongeBob: Holy hurricane, they're Drizzle's parents!
Cloud father: [pats Drizzle on the head] Mm, mm. [mutters sternly to not stay behind again and looks down to see Gale] Hmm? [his thunder rumbles]
[Gale is dangling on Drizzle. He takes out his microphone.]
Gale Doppler: You know, everybody complains about the weather, but my next guests actually do something about it. Did you two always want to be storm clouds?
[Gale points the microphone at Drizzle's cloud parents. They were not very happy for the way Gale treated their son.]
Cloud mother and Cloud father: [inhales and blows Gale away]
Gale Doppler: I'm Gale Doppler, and I could probably use an ambulance, [gets blown off into the distance] right about now! [lands in the dehumidifier, which causes it to explode]
[The sun begins the rise and the cloud family start to leave for their next destination.]
SpongeBob: Good-bye, my little foul weather friend. I'll never forget you, come rain or shine. Mwah! [blow kisses]
Drizzle: Huh? [turns back and gives SpongeBob a smaller storm cloud as a token of appreciation for his kindness]
SpongeBob: Aw, thank you, Drizzle. Don't worry, I'll water him and walk him every day.
Drizzle: [waves good-bye and goes to rejoin his cloud parents] Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: Bye! [looks at the smaller storm cloud] Aw, I'm gonna name you Drizzle Jr. [Drizzle Jr. licks him like a dog just like his father, Drizzle did earlier in the episode] And I know just where to keep you too.
Everyone: Aww!
Gale Doppler: [reveals to have survived the explosion and is completely burned] Aww. [groans]
[Bubble transition back to SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is preparing to start the day as usual and is going to take a shower. He opens the shower curtains and climbs into the tub.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Drizzle Jr. Not too hot but not too cold.
Drizzle Jr.: Uh-huh. [produces rain for SpongeBob to shower]

He decides to go with ""Pat-Star-Piece Theatre"" and picks a book about Great Sir Patrick and the Fire-Breathing Dragon, only to get burned by flames from the book. He then chooses a story about Explorer Patrick on safari in the jungle, when a lion from inside the story encounters SpongeBob and almost causes devastation. SpongeBob finally chooses a book called Swamp Mates, about two buffoons in a bog. After book-bugs leave, the story begins.The story starts with Man Ray robbing the bank. Unfortunately for him, a ship comes from the sky, containing Bubble Bass. The hero escapes the ship and captures Man Ray with his posterior. It is then revealed that the act happened a week earlier, as Bubble Bass and a gang of superheroes are seen watching it on TV in the Mermalair. Bubble Bass introduces the rest to their newest member, Wonder Whale, but she is not at the Mermalair, late for her appointment, as Bubble Bass said. The chief then comes on TV with important news about Wonder Whale, who has been kidnapped by Hoodoo Guru, the Voodoo Villain. Most of the heroes get shocked by the news and faint, while Bubble Bass becomes tough and would do anything to find her. However, the sound of his mother's voice claims the whole thing imaginary, and thus Bubble Bass is seen in the basement of his mother's house.While Bubble Bass was searching for his Wonder Whale action figure, his mother arranged a playdate for him, which is revealed to be with Patrick. The former freaks out about it, especially when Patrick is playing with his action figures. Eventually, it gets to the point when Patrick fills the room with swamp water, and a whirlpool forms in the middle of the basement. The Wonder Whale action figure is seen swirling around the center, but the two playmates are too late to save it, and they too, get sucked down.Bubble Bass and Patrick end up in a swamp with a single log as a raft. After realizing what a swamp is like, Bubble Bass notices a figure with his Wonder Whale action figure. They lose him, assuming he is in a shack. The residents of the dilapidated dwelling take them inside, thinking they were trying to steal their illegal hot sauce that could blow anyone's head off, which is what happens to Patrick before he states that it is not spicy. Bubble Bass and Patrick decide to run away, with the group after them. After a long chase, the hot sauce finally causes Patrick to go full-dragon, so he burns the boat that the hot sauce gang was on.Afterward, the two playmates find the robber again and fall into his snare trap. The villain then reveals himself as Hoodoo Guru, the Voodoo Villain, who stole the action figure to complete his collection. Patrick then offers spaghetti to Bubble Bass, which he got from the net, and Patrick eats the rest, releasing both of them as they land on Hoodoo and retrieve Wonder Whale. But the Voodoo Villain subsequently grabs a Patrick action figure without red spots. This is soon revealed to control Patrick, as his body matches how the action figure posed. After getting back the Wonder Whale action figure, Hoodoo positions Patrick about to throw Bubble Bass, but the villain unintentionally throws Bubble Bass toward himself, and he once again gets defeated.After the swamp mates declare victory, the hot sauce gang re-encounter them, and another chase commences. Unfortunately, the log swam away, but when Bubble Bass was ready to surrender, Patrick gave him trust by becoming his boat. On the other hand, the gang brings the Voodoo Villain with them. But the mention of the power of reluctant friendship freaks them out as they retreat, or that is what Bubble Bass thought. They were really running away from a waterfall from behind the two playmates, and the latter fall down the waterfall.Just after, Bubble Bass wakes up as Patrick performs CPR on Bubble Bass, claiming that he was ""dead"" for ten minutes. The whole thing ended up being a hallucination. Patrick's confidence about the indoor pool, and a slap in the back, release the Wonder Whale action figure from inside Bubble Bass. After his mother complained about the mess in the basement, Bubble Bass says he would prefer the swamp, and Patrick says that that was the best playdate ever. The episode ends with the chief finding a Patrick action figure which completed his collection, a reflection of Hoodoo and his collection.",Swamp Mates,"[The episode begins with SpongeBob talking to Gary in his library.]
SpongeBob: Are you ready for a bedtime story, Gary?
Gary: [goes into his shell and pops out wearing a night hat and yawns] Meow, meow.
SpongeBob: [twists around his chair and starts wearing a fancy outfit] Good evening, Gary, and welcome to Pat-Star-Piece Theatre. [blows out of his bubble pipe]
[Patrick is shown on a high wheel bicycle drinking tea in front of a red stage with Pat-Star-Piece Theatre written in red. There are two trumpets blowing as well.]
Patrick: Hot, hot, hot! [Patrick falls off the bicycle, and a trumpet falls on his face]
SpongeBob: [pulling his mustache] Hmm. [picks out a book] Would you like to hear an exciting story about Great Sir Patrick and the Fire-Breathing Dragon? [he opens the book and gets burned by the contents inside]
Gary: [scared] Meow. [shaking his head] Meow.
SpongeBob: [closes the book, cleans his face and puts the book back on the shelf] Or perhaps a thrilling tale of explorer Patrick on safari in the jungle! [a lion head comes out of the book and roars at SpongeBob, scaring him while Gary hides in his shell. Once he closes it, SpongeBob pants heavily]
Gary: Meow, meow.
SpongeBob: [puts the book inside a cage] Ah! [he picks out a book called ""Swamp Mates."" He blows on the dust and flings into his chair] This is a good one. ""Swamp Mates,"" a story of two buffoons in a bog. [he and Gary laugh. SpongeBob opens the book, disgusted by the amount of bugs there are on it] Gee. Once upon a time, there was a saucy superhero with a prognathous posterior, and they called him [SpongeBob turns the page where Bubble Bass is shown] Bubble Bass.

Bank guard: [points to Man Ray] Stop, thief!
[Bubble Bass is seen in his plane targeting Man Ray and obtaining his information. He hits the eject button and dives in mid-air. He smashes his posterior onto Man Ray, and at that moment the Anchor Man pauses the video.]

Bubble Bass: Thank you, Anchor Man, [he sits up] he was no match for my [shows his posterior to the crew, with dumbbells on them] mighty heinie!

Anchor Man: [he salutes] It's the chief!
The Chief: Wonder Whale isn't late, she's been kidnapped! By the nefarious snare dwell, Hoodoo Guru, the voodoo villain!

Bubble Bass: Mother?! [his stomach fat slaps on the table]

Bubble Bass: [grunts and groans as his fantasy is interrupted as he is in his mother's basement]
Mama Bass: [from across the room] Why don't you go outside and make some real friends?
Bubble Bass: Mother, you know direct sunlight gives me gas. [burps loudly] Besides, I'm busy looking for my Wonder Whale... [looks under the couch] action figure.
Mama Bass: I knew you'd say something like that.
Bubble Bass: [angered] Why you...
Mama Bass: So your mother has scheduled a play date for you.
Bubble Bass: I'm not 23 anymore, mother! You'll just have to cancel it!
Mama Bass: Too late, your new friend is already here. Have fun!
Bubble Bass: [walks up the stairs and hears knocking, then opening the door to reveal Patrick at the entrance] Huh?!
Patrick: Heya, buddy! Ready for our playdate? [squeezes Bubble Bass into a tight hug]
Bubble Bass: [slaps Patrick and picks him up to scold him] I will not associate with such a dimwitted doofus.
Patrick: [flattered] Aw, you're just saying that!
Bubble Bass: Ugh! [throws Patrick back outside of the room and slams the door on him, creating a dent in the shape of his body through the door] Ugh! [gasps to see Patrick somehow found his way into the basement] What?!
Patrick: [laughing as he is playing with his Man Ray and Anchor Man action figures, then chews on the Anchor Man figure]
Bubble Bass: [snatches the Man Ray figurine out of his hand] Put those down! [takes the rest of the action figures on the table and hugs them in protection] My poor little things. Don't worry, daddy will protect you.
Patrick: [starts chewing on the Anchor Man figure]
Bubble Bass: [snatches the figure out of his mouth] You've completely chewed up my limited-edition Anchor Man! [a close-up is shown of the action figure, chewed up and covered in saliva. Bubble Bass then groans]
Patrick: Sorry. I'm teething. [a close-up is shown of Patrick's one tooth and his gums pulsating]
Bubble Bass: [groans as his head start to release smoke due to anger]
Patrick: So... What do you want to do for our play date? [wraps his arm around Bubble Bass' neck]
Bubble Bass: [pushes Patrick aside] I have no time for a cretin like you. I must find my Wonder Whale action figure. [walks off to find it]
Patrick: [gets excited and starts making an amused face] Oh? Oh! I'll help you look! [lifts a box upside down filled with other toys and skims through the pile, then throws some of the toys at the wall]
Bubble Bass: Stop it, you clod! [walks over to Patrick] Do not touch any of my property!
Patrick: Oh! That's okay! We can play with my game. [takes out a gigantic bag from his pants and jumps onto it, which leaks out green liquid] Let's play swamp! [opens up the bag to reveal more of the green liquid, which he then pours on the ground as it floods the basement]
Bubble Bass: [screams and becomes repulsed] Wait, stop! What are you doing?! [screams as Patrick creates a flood. The action figures get lost in the flood, and Bubble Bass manages to catch some of them] No! My precious babies!
Patrick: Heh, no problem! I'll fix it! [flushes the toilet, causing the swamp liquid to flush down]
Bubble Bass: [notices his Wonder Whale action figure in the swamp liquid] My Wonder Whale! [runs to catch it]
Patrick: I got it! [tries to catch it but misses. He hangs onto the toilet so he does not get sucked into the swamp drain, where the toy is heading]
[Bubble Bass hangs onto the back of Patrick's short as Patrick hangs onto the toilet seat, which then detaches as both of them get sucked into the drain and find themselves in a swamp forest. After the screen turns to black, Bubble Bass is shown sticking his head out from the swamp pool with the toilet seat around his neck. He gasps for air.]
Bubble Bass: Wonder Whale! Where are you? [is about to drown] I. Require. Assistance! [sinks into the swamp pool]
Patrick: I've got you, play date partner! [grabs Bubble Bass by the toilet seat to save him from drowning. Patrick then starts to lose balance and slips continuously on the log, causing Bubble Bass to spin in circles]
Bubble Bass: [coughs up liquid as he slowly regains consciousness] Where am I? [is startled as he hears an owl howling and looks around] By the enchanted spatula of Suburban Dad... We're in a real swamp! [notices the toilet seat around his neck] Ew! Why am I wearing this collar of shame?
Patrick: I think it looks good on you.
Bubble Bass: [removes the toilet seat from his neck and throws it into the lake] Eugh! I despise nature.
Patrick: Aw, you just haven't given it a chance. Smell that swamp air!
[Patrick inhales deeply and gets a lot of plants and a few firefly-like jellyfish stuck inside his nose, then sneezes them out as the firejellies fly into Bubble Bass' mouth and sting him constantly before flying out and giving him a tongue blister]
Bubble Bass: [looks at his stung tongue] My tongue! [notices Patrick drinking a cup of liquid] Water! Give me water! [takes Patrick's cup and drinks it, but then spits it out in disgust over realizing it is not water, but rather swamp goo] Ew! Where did you get this disgusting liquid?!
Patrick: [drags his cup through the swamp goo and turns it upside down as it drops into his mouth. He then swallows the goo] Ah. [wipes his mouth] Slimy and refreshing.
Bubble Bass: This can't be happening. [preaches out loud] This place is a nightmare! [sobs] I'll never find my Wonder Whale action figure. [they then hear an evil man laughing and see his shadow behind one of the plants. Both Bubble Bass and Patrick gasp] What is that? [the guy is then revealed to have stolen Bubble Bass' Wonder Whale action figure] My Wonder Whale! That crook stole my precious possession! [points his finger at him] Get him!
Patrick: Are we playing tag? I love tag! [jumps off the log and onto the sand, where Bubble Bass swims to. Patrick puts his dirt-covered hand on Bubble Bass' face] Tag, you're it! [laughs, and then the evil man laughs. The man then takes off with Bubble Bass' action figure]
Bubble Bass: After him! [he and Patrick run to chase the villain. Patrick trips over some rocks and lands his face into Bubble Bass' butt. Bubble Bass pushes his butt away from Patrick]
Patrick: Where'd he go?
Bubble Bass: Perhaps he's in that dilapidated dwelling. [points to an old shack house]
Patrick: Doubt it. Maybe he's in that shack? [points to it, and Bubble Bass is angered. They then look through the window of the shack to reveal a blue and green crocodile; the blue one pouring peppers into a machine]
Bubble Bass: Hmph. It's just some uncouth natives. [he and Patrick get grabbed by the heads by a purple crocodile]
Patrick: Hello! [he and Bubble Bass then get thrown into the shack]
Buford: I caught these two a peepin' through the window.
Cletus: They're thieves! Trying to steal our illegal hot sauce!
Bubble Bass: Illegal?
Luther: Our swamp sauce is so spicy, it can blow your head clean off.
Bubble Bass: I assure you we are not interested in your disgusting hot sauce.
Cletus: Then what's he doing?
Patrick: [gulps the bucket of hot sauce, and his head explodes from his body and makes a steam sound, and falls into Bubble Bass' arms] Huh. You call that spicy? [burps out flames, causing the nearby equipment to catch on fire]
Bubble Bass: [aiming Patrick's head at the crocodiles] Back off, you backwater bumpkins! Run!
[Bubble Bass runs with Patrick's head, and Patrick's body runs soon after.]
Cletus: After 'em, boys!
[The crocodiles run after Patrick and Bubble Bass. Patrick's body is exhausted, and his head is panting. Bubble Bass puts Patrick's head back onto his body. They both look behind them, and scream and run away again.]
Cletus: You ain't a-gettin' away that easy!
Luther: [launches a hot pepper from a slingshot] Yee-ha.
[The hot pepper causes an explosion behind Patrick and Bubble Bass. Cletus launches more hot peppers with his slingshot, which explode in the water.]
Bubble Bass: Ha, [taunting with his butt] too slow, you cold-blooded clowns. [he gasps as he sees that the crocodiles are now in a boat heading towards them. He quickly pedals the log forward] Those crocs are catching up with us!
Patrick: [groans; his belly growls] That hot sauce has already caught up with me. [he burps a flame onto Bubble Bass' head]
Bubble Bass: [gasps] That's it!
[Bubble Bass grabs onto Patrick's tongue and wraps it around Patrick, who lets out a flame, both propelling them across and burning the crocodiles.]
Cletus: What?! [their boat stops]
[The scene bubble transitions to Bubble Bass and Patrick on the log.]
Bubble Bass: So, play date partner. What are we supposed to do now? Hmm?
[Patrick gargles the swamp water, and creates a geyser with it while giggling. Bubble Bass facepalms. Bubble Bass then notices the evil man, who still has his Wonder Whale.]
Bubble Bass: Give me back my Wonder Whale! [leaps off of the log, running towards the man]
Hoodoo Guru: Huh? [runs away]
Patrick: [with kelp on his head] Huh? Hey, wait for me, buddy!
Bubble Bass: Come back here! [the man is now in front of a giant rock] You'll swing for this, you ruffian!
Hoodoo Guru: I am afraid you are the ones who will swing. [pulls a rope, causing Patrick and Bubble Bass to be trapped in a net] [laughs] You ignoramuses fell right into my trap.
Patrick: [raises hand] Technically, I'm a doofus.
[The man blinks, and then takes his disguise off to reveal himself as Hoodoo Guru.]
Bubble Bass: Hoodoo Guru the Voodoo Villain? He's real!
Hoodoo Guru: That's right, Bubble Bass, and your precious Wonder Whale is all mine.
Bubble Bass: I dread to think what horrific ritual you will use it for.
Hoodoo Guru: Huh? Ritual, shmitual! [presses a button on the rock; it opens up a shelf of his action figures] I just needed it to complete my collection. [places Wonder Whale onto the shelf]
Bubble Bass: Stealing from a fellow collector? That's despicable! I will thrash you, sir! [tries to break out of the net] Can't break out.
Patrick: [bell rings] You're probably weak from hunger. Here, try some of this spaghetti. [gives Bubble Bass a plate of spaghetti, who eats it all in one slurp]
Bubble Bass: Mmm! [flexes his bicep] Glorious caloric intake! Wherever did you find it?
Patrick: We're sitting on it! [slurps on the net, which is made of spaghetti]
[The net falls apart, and Bubble Bass and Patrick scream as it makes them fall onto Hoodoo Guru.]
Hoodoo Guru: Ouch.
Bubble Bass: [gasps as he takes back his Wonder Whale] Ha ha! Evil never triumphs against a truly obsessive fan!
Patrick: Yeah! Evil never triumphs over a oscillating fan!
Hoodoo Guru: [groans] Hmm? Not so fast, Bubble Bass. I've got one more trick up my sleeve. Or should I say, up my glove! [a woman screams as he pulls a Patrick voodoo doll from his glove; Hoodoo laughs]
Bubble Bass: A Patrick Star action figure? Ha! No collector would touch such trash.
Patrick: Plus, it's a choking hazard.
[Hoodoo makes the voodoo doll raise its arm, making Patrick raise his arm as well. Patrick struggles to put his arm down as it keeps raising itself up.]
Patrick: What's going on?
Bubble Bass: That fiend, Hoodoo, is using his magic voodoo doll powers.
[Hoodoo laughs as he makes Patrick choke Bubble Bass, extending Bubble Bass' arm.]
Patrick: Sorry.
Hoodoo Guru: [grabs the Wonder Whale from Bubble Bass' arm] I'll take that.
[Hoodoo laughs again as he makes Patrick pick up Bubble Bass. He then makes Patrick spin Bubble Bass around.]
Bubble Bass: Stop! I'm allergic to centrifugal force!
[Patrick keeps spinning Bubble Bass around, and eventually tosses him directly into Hoodoo.]
Hoodoo Guru: Uh-oh. [he gets hit by Bubble Bass, making the Patrick voodoo doll fall into the sand. The real Patrick falls into the sand as well]
Bubble Bass: [on top of Hoodoo] Ha! I'll return this to its rightful owner. [taking back his Wonder Whale] Me.
Patrick: [embracing Bubble Bass with his muddy body] Well done, pal.
Bubble Bass: [shoves Patrick back] Eww.
Buford: [emerging from the tall grass] Hey, Luther, Cletus, I found them fellers what blowed up our still!
Patrick: Oh, hi!
[Bubble Bass dashes away, leaving behind a bubble version of himself.]
Bubble: Run. [disappears]
[Patrick and Bubble Bass run away from the crocodiles as they launch hot peppers at them. Hoodoo is running alongside the crocodiles. The hot peppers hit Patrick and Bubble Bass' log, sinking it.]
Bubble Bass: No, our only escape! If only I had something large and buoyant.
Patrick: I don't know what that means, but... [leaps into the swamp on his back] Hop on, friend!
Bubble Bass: Friend?
Patrick: Sure, you're my play date, right, buddy?
Bubble Bass: B-B-B-B-Buddy? [jumps onto Patrick's belly, who paddles away]
[The crocodiles and Hoodoo hop over some tall grass in the boat from earlier. Patrick and Bubble Bass scream, and Bubble Bass pushes Patrick along.]
Hoodoo Guru: It's over, Bubble Bass! Give up!
Bubble Bass: You will never win, Hoodoo, because we have the power of reluctant friendship!
[The crocodiles and Hoodoo gasp and turn the boat around.]
Bubble Bass: Yeah, that's right. Run away from our righteous acquaintance!
Patrick: Uh, they might be running from that. [points to the waterfall in front of them]
[Bubble Bass screams, and they both try paddling away from the stream. Bubble Bass holds onto a rock, but loses his grip, causing him and Patrick to fall down. The screen fades to black as it cuts back to Bubble Bass in the basement. He opens his eyes to Patrick giving him CPR.]
Bubble Bass: [pushes Patrick off of him, coughing and spitting] What happened?
Patrick: Oh, you were dead for like [looks at the tally marks on his arm] 10 minutes.
Bubble Bass: Oh, it was all just a hallucination? Then my Wonder Whale action figure is still missing.
Patrick: Well, you may have lost your toy, but you've gained an indoor pool! [slaps Bubble Bass on the shoulder, causing the Wonder Whale to exit his mouth and land in Bubble Bass' hands] Congratulations!
Bubble Bass: My precious Wonder Whale! [cradles the Wonder Whale]
Mama Bass: [off screen] Bubble Bass! What did you do to my basement?
Bubble Bass: [tugs on his shirt] Perhaps the swamp wasn't so bad after all. [slithers into the swamp water]
Patrick: Best play date ever! [slithers into the swamp water as well]
[The scene fades to black as it cuts to the underground lair. The monitor turns on, showing the Chief.]

Then, Plankton drives a huge barrel of old chum to the place where he usually dumps it, but when Plankton opens it, he realizes that it is already filled to the top, so he begins to look for other places. He tries the well, but it is also clogged.Along the way, Plankton accidentally stumbles upon SpongeBob, who is walking with Gary. SpongeBob spots a barrel of chum and asks what it is for. Plankton replies that it is for a holiday called Chum Day. On this day, the fish supposedly give each other chum. Then SpongeBob agrees to help Plankton make ""gifts"" in the city, much to his delight. The two of them go to Mr. Krabs' house, where they pour chum under the carpet. Then they start to spread chum everywhere until they finally say goodbye.On the way home, SpongeBob sees that the streets of Bikini Bottom are flooded with chum. The angry residents quickly run to Plankton and want to beat him, but SpongeBob, in a Santa hat, starts to tell and sing about the day of chum. Then the fish are happy and proceed to celebrate, but the sanitary inspector gives Plankton a fine and forces him to eat all the spilled chum for the safety of the citizens, as the episode ends.",Plankton's Old Chum,"[The episode begins at the Chum Bucket in the evening.]
Karen and Plankton: Five, four, three, two, one!
[The chum in the barrel turns brown and explodes all over the laboratory.]
Plankton: [wipes rotten chum off his face] You know, it's remarkable how chum goes bad every week right on time.
Karen: Yeah, just like your underpants.
Plankton: What? They're good for another month. [his underwear pops off his body]
Karen: Now go and get rid of that chum before the Health Inspector gives us a fine. [begins to leave, but turns around.] And don't play with it!
Plankton: [pokes the rotten chum with a stick and laughs] But it makes a funny sound!
[The rotten chum bubbles over and eats the stick. It belches out a foul breath in Plankton's face, making him faint. Plankton takes the barrel of rotten chum out of the Chum Bucket and goes to dump it down the sewer.]
Plankton: Hm. [reads the sign] ""No chum dumping. $1 billion fine."" Eat chum, sign! [sprays rotten chum at the sign; the rotten chum changes the sign that reads, ""Chum Dumping?....Alright fine! (See if I care!)] Ha-ha! [chuckles; tries to open the manhole, but it's stuck] Eugene H. Krabs! [lifts the manhole lid and overfills the sewer with rotten chum] I guess I've used this sewer hole one too many times. [tries to push the manhole lid, but it's too heavy; he paints the chum to make it look like the manhole lid] Those evil painting lessons I took really come in handy. [leaves with the barrel of rotten chum]
Business Man: And so I said to Andy that, uh— [sinks into Plankton's rotten chum] Yeah, Larry. I'm gonna have to call you back.
Plankton: [takes the barrel of chum to a wishing well] Oh, yeah, this old wishing well. I'll just dump some chum in here. [climbs up the well's wall and looks inside; he sees the well is full of rotten chum] Guess I've gone to this well once too often. [gasps] Wait, I know! [takes out a quarter] I wish this well was empty of chum. [tosses the quarter in the well, but sinks into the chum] Lousy rip off. [leaves with the barrel of rotten chum]
[Little did Plankton know, the wishing well magically makes the chum disappear and the business man climbs out.]
Business Man: [coughs out the quarter and calls on his phone] And I'm back.
[Plankton takes the rotten chum to a local snail park. He pushes the hose through the hole in the fence and into one of the holes in SpongeBob's back. Rotten chum sprays out through SpongeBob's holes and he flies all around in the air. SpongeBob finds this very ticklish and laughs in joy. Down on the ground, Gary and the other citizens in the snail park are getting covered in rotten chum. SpongeBob lands on the ground with rotten chum all over his body.]
SpongeBob: That was unbelievable! [sees the rotten chum] Wait a minute. What is this? Chum?
Plankton: No, of course not. It's...it's, uh, a gift!
SpongeBob: A gift? For who?
Plankton: [walks off with the barrel of rotten chum] For you. For everyone.
SpongeBob: Sure looks like chum. [follows SpongeBob]
[Gary comes out from behind the fence.]
Plankton: It's new chum. It's delicious. [eats some rotten chum and gags]
SpongeBob: New chum? Ooh, let me try.
Plankton: [slaps the rotten chum off of SpongeBob's fingers] No! Uh, you have to wait. For, uh, like a holiday.
SpongeBob: Holiday? What holiday?
Plankton: Um. Chum Day...?
SpongeBob: Chum Day. Tell me about Chum Day. What's it like? What do you do?
Plankton: I'll tell you all about it if you help me hide all these gifts.
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Chum Day. A brand new holiday! [turns to Gary] Okay, Gary. You can go home.
Gary: Meow. [slithers off, gets into a boatmobile, and drives away off-screen]
Plankton: Was that his car?
SpongeBob: No.
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob carrying Plankton and dragging the barrel of rotten chum down the street.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, and does it snow chum on Chum Day? [giggles]
Plankton: Uh, sure.
SpongeBob: Do the kids make chum men? What about icicles? Do you call them [giggles] Chum-cicles?
Plankton: Yeah, whatever. [sees Mr. Krabs' house] Wait a minute. This is Krabs' house.
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. I thought we could hide his chum gifts inside by pumping them through the window. [goes up to the window] Oh, darn, the window's closed.
Plankton: Hey, what's that? [blasts the window while distracting SpongeBob] The window's open.
SpongeBob: Yay! [pushes the hose through the window and sprays rotten chum under the rug]
Mr. Krabs: [yawns] Who's there? Wha— [trips over the lump in the rug and groans; he then falls asleep]
SpongeBob: Aw. [pushes the rotten chum from under the rug to make it more comfortable] Shh. [takes the hose and exits Mr. Krabs' house through the window] I bet he has visions of sugar chums dancing in his head. [giggles]
Plankton: Let's keep moving.
[A montage of SpongeBob and Plankton hiding rotten chum in various places is shown. Bubble transition to SpongeBob hides some rotten chum in Patrick's rock. Then he hides it under the hat of a sleeping cowboy. Then he hides rotten chum in the chimney of a house. Then he hides rotten chum inside a child's teddy bear. Mrs. Puff is on her chair watching television and eating popcorn in the middle of the night. SpongeBob plugs her mouth with the hose and inflates her with rotten chum. Bubble transition to the Chum Bucket at the brink of dawn.]
SpongeBob: And we'll drink chum-nog and sing around the chum-chum tree and there'll be colorful chum lights all over town.
Plankton: Yes. That'd be good. Heh heh. [jumps off of SpongeBob and taps on the barrel] Sounds like there's only one scoop left.
SpongeBob: Ooh, that one's for you! Let me hide it. I want to hide it!
[Plankton groans and gives SpongeBob the last scoop of the rotten chum.]
SpongeBob: Okay now, go home so you don't see where I hide it.
Plankton: Oh, no, I wouldn't want to see that. [quietly as he takes the barrel back to the Chum Bucket] What a numbskull. [walks a few miles away from SpongeBob, then stops and looks back]
SpongeBob: [sing-songy] No peeking!
Plankton: [turns and resumes heading back to the Chum Bucket] Well, Plankton, you got rid of it all. And with no chum-uppance. [chuckles] Whoa. [pauses and looks around before resuming with his evil laughter]
[Bubble transition to a very tired SpongeBob trying to find a place for the rotten chum.]
SpongeBob: [yawns] What time is it? I guess I should hide Plankton's Chum Day gift before Chum Day's all over. [stops at a manhole] Ah-ha! I bet Plankton would never think to look in the sewer. [kicks the lid open and sees it filled with rotten chum] Oh. Chum. Oh, well. Maybe I can get a little more in there. [puts the chum in but doesn't go down; he pushes real hard to get it to go down then he closes the lid; he chuckles until suddenly, the ground shakes]
[Rotten chum erupts from the ground and comes back down as little chum flakes. One man comes out from his house and slips on the rotten chum.]
Man #1: [takes out a sign] Caution wet chum!
[A lady is driving in her boatmobile, but skids off the road due to the rotten chum.]
Lady #1: [crashes into sign and reads it] ""Slippery wet chum?""
Baby: Mmm, nummy!
Baby's mother: [slaps the rotten chum off of her baby's hands] Don't eat chum off the sidewalk. Bah!
Various Bikini Bottomites: There's chum here! Ew! [chattering angrily] What's with all the chum? Call my lawyer!
Plankton: [comes out of the Chum Bucket and sees rotten chum snowing down] What has that yellow idiot done?! [becomes surrounded by an angry mob]
Man #1: Our homes have been ruined by you and your stinking chum!
Woman: Your chum ruined my hair!
Patrick: Your chum made me dumb!
Man #2: You were already dumb.
Patrick: Well, it didn't make me any smarter!
Kid #1: Get him!
Angry mob: Yeah! [grab Plankton and prepare to beat him up]
[Suddenly, SpongeBob, who is wearing a Santa hat, appears and is ice skating on the rotten chum.]
Choir: [sings in the tune of Carol of the Bells off-screen] ♪Chum, chum, chum, chum, chum-chum-chum-chum♪
[SpongeBob skids some of the rotten chum on Patrick and the angry mob.]
SpongeBob: We shouldn't be fighting. [picks up two scoops of rotten chum] It's Chum Day.
Man #1: Chum Day?
Baby's mother: What's Chum Day?
SpongeBob: [skates all over the place while singing in the tune of Deck the Halls] ♪ Deck the sea with lumps of new chum / Chuma chuma chum, chum, chum, chum, chum / 'Tis the season to be chum dumb / Chuma chuma chum, chum, chum, chum, chum / Don we now our chum apparel / Chuma chum chuma chum, chum, chum, chum / As we sing this stinky carol / Chuma chuma chum, chum, chum, chum, chum ♪
[Everyone looks at SpongeBob with blank and confused looks on their faces.]
SpongeBob: [takes some chum and makes it into a beard, making himself a chum version of Santa Claus] Chum! Chum! Chum! Hello, I'm Chumta Claus.
[Everyone is still looking at SpongeBob with blank and confused looks on their faces.]
Man #1: So anyway, back to the mob violence.
[Just as everyone proceed to beating Plankton to the bone, they stop and notice all the children having fun. Building chum men, making chum angels and throwing chum balls like how they do it when it snows in the winter. A kid on a sled slides up to the angry mob.]
Kid #2: Merry Chum Day, everyone.
Angry mob: [confused] Huh? [subside their anger and instead greets each other with thanks like how they do it on Christmas] Strong grip, huh? Yeah.
Mayor: I officially declare today Chum Day! [kicks the kid on the sled away by accident]
[Everyone cheers in excitement. Bubble transition to kids decorating a tree with rotten chum like how they decorate a Christmas tree. The purple kid wakes up and a lump of rotten chum comes out of his teddy bear.]
Kid #3: Whoa! Yay!
Man #3: [trying to catch chum flakes on his tongue like how everyone does it with snowflakes] Whoo! Heh. Tastes really bad.
Nancy Suzy Fish: But the holiday spirit is keeping us in denial.
Man #3: [holds up a lump of rotten chum with a toe in it] Gristle toe? [shares a kiss with Nancy Suzy Fish]
[Squidward wakes up from his bed and goes to the window. He gasps in wonder and sees chum flakes falling.]
Squidward: Huh? [sees Morty walking in the sidewalk] Ah. You! Boy! What day is today?
Morty: Today?
Squidward: Such an intelligent boy. A remarkable boy. Yes, today! What is today?
Morty: Why, it's Chum Day!
Squidward: Then I haven't missed it! [pauses] Wait a minute. Chum Day?! That's disgusting! [slams his window shut]
[Everyone is continuing their Chum Day festivities.]
Plankton: You all love Chum Day? [mutters in excitement] It was me! I invented Chum Day! Chum Day is copy-written by me! [gets bumped into the Health Inspector's shoes]
Andy Yellowtail: Uh, excuse me, are you responsible for all this chum?
Plankton: Yes, that's right. You're welcome.
Andy Yellowtail: Well, as the Health Inspector, [holds up his badge] I've got something for you. [gives Plankton a paper]
Plankton: Hm. [reads paper] $1 billion?! [whimpers and faints]
Andy Yellowtail: You know, there is a way out of paying the fine.
Plankton: I'll do it. What is it?
Andy Yellowtail: [holds up a spoon] You can eat up all the chum. [scoops up some rotten chum and feeds it to Plankton]
Plankton: [coughs] Isn't there anyone that knows the true meaning of Chum Day?
SpongeBob: I know.
Plankton: Huh?
SpongeBob: Lights, please. [the lights turn off and a spotlight shines on SpongeBob] And lo, there was chum. A food that turned from revolting to festive by magical thinking. And the goodwill of chum clogged the hearts of fish kind and ushered in a new— [gets hit numerous times by chum balls, much to his joyful laughter]
French narrator: Several days later...

Meanwhile, Patrick is taking a long time to order something, much to Squidward's annoyance. SpongeBob says ""hi"" to Mrs. Puff, but Mrs. Puff reminds him that they should pretend not to know each other when they are not at school. SpongeBob delivers two Krabby Patties to Mrs. Puff and Pearl by spitting them out of his eyes. Out of nowhere, the local health inspector appears. He pulls a device and scans the room, declaring the Krusty Krab to be a health hazard. He suspects that someone in the restaurant has a case of the disease known as ""Clam Flu"" and puts the restaurant under quarantine, locking everyone inside.This causes everyone except for SpongeBob to run around, screaming and panicking. Patrick then asks what a quarantine actually is, and SpongeBob replies that it is like a ""mandatory sleepover."" Squidward debunks this, saying that a quarantine is when a group of people are forced to be locked in a room with a sick person, until eventually everyone gets sick. Overhearing everything that has just happened and not wanting to get sick himself, Plankton comes out of a nearby soda cup, saying that he is abandoning ""operation soda-jerk."" He escapes via the restaurant's funnel, but is immediately lasered by a hazmat fish, prompting everyone else to stay inside.Pearl complains, but Mr. Krabs states that back in his navy days, when one of his fellow sailors got sick, they would isolate the ""sicko"" and lock them in the freezer so that the others can enjoy their good health. When Mrs. Puff asks if they let the sicko out of the freezer once he got better, Mr. Krabs hesitates and says that somebody probably let them out eventually, which concerns Mrs. Puff. Mr. Krabs asks if anyone is feeling sick, to which nobody responds, prompting him to use a pair of tongs as a threat. This causes Squidward to freak out and bump into a table, launching a pepper shaker into the air and into SpongeBob's nose, causing him to sneeze. Everyone assumes that SpongeBob has the disease, even though he clearly doesn't.SpongeBob states that he will go into the freezer willingly, despite not feeling sick. He tries to have an emotional speech, but he is cut short when Mr. Krabs slams the door in his face. It is then revealed that SpongeBob is having fun in the freezer, sledding on a mountain of snow and eating ice cream. Everyone is relieved as they think the worst of the quarantine is over. Patrick looks over and notices that SpongeBob has an ice cream cone, making him interested. Patrick pretends to be sick by rubbing relish all over himself. This causes everyone to freak out, and Patrick ends up getting locked in the freezer. SpongeBob and Patrick end up having a snowball fight with chocolate ice cream.Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl are sitting at a table, paranoid if anyone else has the disease. Squidward itches his arm, and Pearl accuses him of having the Clam Flu. Mr. Krabs throws Squidward in the freezer. Mrs. Puff then yawns, making Mr. Krabs freak out, and he locks her in the freezer as well. Pearl remembers that she still had money left over from last time she went to the mall. This makes Mr. Krabs think that the flu has poisoned Pearl's mind, and he locks her in the freezer too. In the freezer, everyone meets inside an igloo, and Squidward finds out that nobody in the freezer is actually sick. Mrs. Puff then deduce that Mr. Krabs is the one with the sickness, causing Pearl to cry. Squidward decides that the only option is to break out of the freezer and lock Mr. Krabs inside. Everyone agrees, except for SpongeBob, who is reluctant at first. Squidward convinces him by explaining that he cannot make Krabby Patties if he is locked in the freezer. And SpongeBob accepts it as he puts his sunglasses on to put the crab on ice.Everyone busts out of the freezer, much to Mr. Krabs' surprise. Patrick tries to attack him, but Krabs shrinks himself down and hides under the grill. SpongeBob chases Mr. Krabs under the grill and tries to convince him to go willingly, but Mr. Krabs refuses and goes down a pipe leading to the grease trap. SpongeBob comes out from under the grill, covered in mold and unaware of what to do. Squidward then says somebody has to go down there and get Mr. Krabs out before he escapes into the sewers and infects the whole town. Patrick lifts up the grill and shoves Squidward through the pipe, not knowing there was a hatch that leads down there, covering him in grease. After seeing Squidward and had sicko germs from Squidward's sneeze, Mr. Krabs escapes the grease trap and runs into the dining room. Pearl gives chase, but Mr. Krabs gets stuck in her blowhole. Pearl sneezes him out, but he loses his shirt in the processes, causing her blowhole to get plugged up. Patrick corners Mr. Krabs, and they begin to fight. During the fight, Mr. Krabs throws Patrick into the broom closet, covering him in dust. Patrick grabs Mr. Krabs with his tongue and throws him to Mrs. Puff, who catches him in a garbage can. She puffs up, causing trash to fall all over her.Later that night after the battlefield, the health inspector returns to the Krusty Krab and goes inside. He says that he made a mistake (it is surprisingly revealed that he had been holding his tracking equipment upside-down when he came by earlier yesterday) meaning nobody actually had Clam Flu. However, he finds out that everyone now has a different disease, and Mr. Krabs has a combination of all five diseases due to the fight they had earlier of a failure plan to send him back to the freezer. The health inspector panics and runs out of the restaurant, yelling that everyone is actually sick and declares an ""Ultra-Mega Quarantine."" A team of Hazmat units lock the Krusty Krab inside of a crate and airlift it over to the Chum Bucket, where it is dropped. Plankton is heard begging the gang to stay away so he does not get sick, only to end up sneezing; revealing that he was the one with Clam Flu the whole time as the episode ends.",Kwarantined Krab,"[The episode starts at the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [talking to Pearl and Mrs. Puff] Oh, I love it when my two best gals become my two best paying customers. Sit tight, lunch is almost ready!
SpongeBob: [comes out of the Krusty Krab kitchen with Krabby Patties in his eyes] Order up!
Patrick: [standing in front of the Galley Grub] Uh... let me get a southwestern patty, heavy on the south. [grabs Squidward's arm] No, wait! Uh...
[Mrs. Puff laughs until SpongeBob starts squashing her face, at which point she starts grunting.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, that feels like Mrs. Puff! Hi, Mrs. Puff! [laughs]
Mrs. Puff: Remember, SpongeBob, we agreed. Outside of class, we don't know each other.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah! Well, here's your Krabby Patty, mysterious lady. [pops the components of a Krabby Patty out of his eyes for Mrs. Puff and Pearl, alongside his eyeballs] ""Eye"" hope you enjoy your meal! [laughs as a rimshot is heard]
[A health inspector enters by kicking the door open.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] The health inspector?! But I already bribed him this year!
Health inspector: [uses his detector] Just as I feared. Someone in this restaurant is infected with the highly contagious Clam Flu! You're all under quarantine! [locks up the Krusty Krab, declaring it a quarantine area]
[Everyone in the Krusty Krab apart from SpongeBob starts panicking and running around.]
Patrick: Wait, what's a quarter bean?
SpongeBob: A quarantine is like a mandatory sleepover. And we're all invited!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Sleepover! Sleepover!
Squidward: [blows a horn to silence them] A quarantine means you're locked in here with a sick person, until we're all sick and miserable.
Plankton: [comes out of a cup through the straw] Well, I'm aborting Operation Soda Jerk. Communicable diseases are my cue to leave. [leaves through a vent and laughs] Quarantine shmorentine. I'm the great... [screams while getting burned to a crisp with a laser by a robot. A quarantine enforcement person comes up]
HAZMAT Unit: Breach contained. Good work! [high-fives the robot as they leave]
Squidward: [gulps] Maybe we should stay inside.
Pearl: But I have to cheer at the big game tomorrow. Everyone's going to laugh at me if I get sick and die first. [stomps her foot]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, not to worry, my massive little angel. We'll just do what we did in me old navy days.
SpongeBob: Ooh, old navy days.
Mr. Krabs: You see, first, we found the sicko, and then we just locked him in the freezer hole! With the infected sailor isolated, the rest of us could enjoy ourselves, certain of our continued good health. Ah, good times.
Mrs. Puff: You... let them out of the freezer once they were better, right?
Mr. Krabs: Huh? I suppose... someone let them out, eventually. Okay, who's feeling queasy? Go on now, raise your hand. [no one says anything] So, that's how you want to play it, eh? [takes out forceps] Fine, I'll examine all of you, for signs of the pestilence itself!
Squidward: Oh, no, I am not letting any of you infected imbeciles near me! [trips up over a table and launches a pepper shaker into SpongeBob's nose, making him sneeze. Everyone panics, thinking SpongeBob has the Clam Flu]
Squidward: He's the sick one! He belongs in the freezer! Get him!
Mr. Krabs: Yah! [charges at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Wait! I'll go willingly. I feel fine, but... I don't wanna risk infecting my friends. Especially you, Squidward. [kisses his cheek. Squidward screams and sprays his cheek with disinfectant. SpongeBob sadly opens the freezer's door] All I ask is that you remember me as I was, full of life- [Mr. Krabs shoves him in the freezer and closes the door]
Mr. Krabs: Phew.
SpongeBob: Yah!
Mrs. Puff: Oh, it sounds like he's really suffering in there! Oh, I can't bare to look... [turns away, but smiles] But can someone describe it to me?
Mr. Krabs: All right, come on now, come on, let the poor boy enjoy his agony in peace.
SpongeBob: Whoooo!
[In the freezer, SpongeBob is skiing.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oooh, ice cream!
[Back at the Krusty Krab, everybody except Patrick is sitting behind one table.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, problem solved! Now we sit back and wait for the all clear.
Patrick: [checking up on SpongeBob] Hmm? Hey. [notices him licking the ice cream] Ooooh... [walks up to the gang with an open pack of relish behind his back, slurring] Boy, I sure am feeling under the... leather.
Squidward: It's ""weather"" , you moron. And--ah! [notices Patrick, causing him and Mrs. Puff to gasp] Sweet Neptune!
[Patrick has relish all over his body, which everyone else mistakes for Clam Flu spots.]
Mr. Krabs: The Clam Flu! It's spreading! Into the freezer with him! [tosses Patrick into the freezer using forceps]
[In the freezer, SpongeBob and Patrick have a snowball fight with ice cream. Patrick throws some chocolate ice cream into SpongeBob's eyes, which launch them back into Patrick's mouth.]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] We'll just have to be more vigilant now. Anyone could be a carrier.
[Squidward scratches his arm tentacle.]
Pearl: Itchy Skin! He's got Clam Flu!
Squidward: What? No, no! I was just scratching!
Mr. Krabs: To the freezer! [uses the boot to kick Squidward into the freezer with Pearl shutting the door.]
[Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs having a five o'clock shadow. He and Mrs. Puff dart eyes at each other until Mrs. Puff yawns.]
Mr. Krabs: Freezer! [throws Mrs. Puff into the freezer. Hyenas are heard laughing] At least we know we're safe now, my baby beluga.
Pearl: Oh! I just remembered. I didn't spend all your money at the mall. [hands Mr. Krabs some money] Here's your change.
Mr. Krabs: Change? Oh, the disease must've addled your tiny teenage mind!
Pearl: Wait, I take it back! There's still some shoes I wanna buy! [Mr. Krabs tosses her into the freezer, then wears a mask and sprays the money with disinfectant. Cut to inside of the freezer as ""Jingle Bells"" is playing.]
Squidward: So, let me get this straight. [cut to inside of an igloo] Nobody in this freezer is actually sick?
SpongeBob: [speaking at the same time] Never felt better.
Pearl: [speaking at the same time] Healthy.
Mrs. Puff: [speaking at the same time] Not me.
Patrick: Ice cream!
Mrs. Puff: Well, if no one is sick in here, then the sick person must be...
Pearl: [gasps] Daddy! Oh, no! [starts crying tears which turn into ice cubes]
Mrs. Puff: There, there. [gets hit by the ice cubes, grunting slightly]
Squidward: I say we bust out of here, grab Krabs, and lock him away!
Mrs. Puff: Oh, yeah!
Pearl: Daddy?!
Patrick: Who's this now? [eats some ice cream]
SpongeBob: Well, I don't know. Mr. Krabs didn't tell us to question his orders. I'll just wait for him to let me out.
Squidward: [smiling to convince him] You can't cook Krabby Patties if you're locked in the freezer.
SpongeBob: [shocked of hearing what Squidward said, and now changes his mind] All right. [puts on sunglasses] Let's put this crab on ice.
[Everyone busts out of the freezer, with Mr. Krabs noticing.]
Mr. Krabs: [screams] You sickos are supposed to be in the freezer!
Patrick: You're the sicko! [jumps towards Mr. Krabs, but he flattens himself to get out of the way, so he crashes into a table instead]
Mr. Krabs: Stay away from me, you sickos! [crawls under the grill, to where SpongeBob also flattens himself and crawls under in pursuit. Both of them getting covered in the grime there in the process]
SpongeBob: For the good of all of us, you have to go into the freezer!
Mr. Krabs: Keep your filthy hands off me, you infected ingrate! [notices the opening leading to the grease trap] Oh, look. Freedom! [drains himself into the grease trap. SpongeBob then crawls out from under the grill, now covered in the grime present of being infected]
SpongeBob: He's in the grease trap!
Squidward: Well, someone's gonna have to fish him out before he gets to the sewer and infects the whole town!
Patrick: Hey, I can help! [pries the grill out of the way and begins shoving Squidward into the opening to the grease trap]
SpongeBob: Patrick, Patrick!
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: There's a full-sized hatch over here. [begins scratching himself]
Patrick: Well, what do you know? [finishes shoving Squidward into the grease trap]
Squidward: [falls into the grease] Eugene? Are you in here?
[Mr. Krabs surfaces behind him, catching him off-guard, making him scream and cough to get some of the grease that was on him onto him.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah! Sicko germs! [leaves the grease trap through the full sized hatch, catching SpongeBob by surprise] You can't catch me! I'm too healthy for all you, sickos! [laughs as he leaves through the service window]
Pearl: Daddy, stop! [follows him through the service window, prying it off the wall due to her massive size]
[The others head to the dining area to see Pearl with the service window around her neck and Mr. Krabs stuck in her blowhole. She sniffs him up and and sneezes him out, with him missing his shirt. Mr. Krabs lands near a corner and Patrick confronts him.]
Patrick: There's nowhere left to run!
Mr. Krabs: I'm not licked yet! [snaps his claws]
Patrick: [boxing bell ringing] Oh, yeah? [uses his tongue to try and grab Mr. Krabs, but he dodges and grabs his tongue and begins swinging him around] Hey, hey! SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs: You'll never get me! [swings Patrick into the broom closet, getting him covered in dust, but he yanks on the tongue, yanking him into the closet, getting him covered in dust as well]
[Patrick then regains control of his tongue and begins swinging Mr. Krabs around, catching Squidward and making him crash into SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs eventually lets go and is sent flying towards Pearl, who is shown to now have a stuffy blowhole, and she dodges him, making him land in a trash can held by Mrs. Puff.]
Mrs. Puff: I got him! I got- [suddenly inflates sending the trash can flying with Mr. Krabs inside. He lands on a window, and the trash with the trash can land on Mrs. Puff's head]
[The battle continues until nighttime, when the health inspector returns, unlocks the chains with a key and enters the restaurant.]
Health inspector: Hello? Anyone here? Ha, funny story, um... [holds out his detector] I was holding my equipment [flips his detector 180 degrees] upside down yesterday. Nobody was actually sick! Oh, what a goof. [hears some moaning and turns on his flashlight to investigate, and notices Squidward, whose feet are noticeably swollen] Oh, my Neptune! Grease Gout. [notices SpongeBob looking all moldy as he scratches himself] Moldy Measles! [notices a pile of trash shifting, and out emerges Mrs. Puff, coughing up a tin can] Trash Trichinosis! [notices Patrick lying down with his tongue all stretched out, as he coughs up three literal dust bunnies who scurry away] Dust Bunny Bronchitis?! [notices Pearl, still with her stuffy blowhole, as she sneezes out Mr. Krabs' shirt cover in boogers] Polyester Plague?! [something drips on his arm and he notices the source. He gasps. It is Mr. Krabs, showing symptoms for all of the diseases, even coughing up a literal dust bunny] The whole shebang?! [everyone crawls towards him and he quickly escapes] They're all sick! Ultra-Mega Quarantine!
HAZMAT Unit: You heard him! Get this disease-ridden cesspit out of here!
[More HAZMAT Units board up the Krusty Krab in a huge wooden crate.]
HAZMAT Unit: Drop it somewhere safe.
[A helicopter shows up and deploys a hook, and a HAZMAT Unit applies it to a lifting ring.]
HAZMAT Unit: Somewhere no one ever goes.
[The helicopter lifts the Krusty Krab and drops it on the Chum Bucket.]
Plankton: [off-screen] What the...?!
[The sickos are ready to attack Plankton off-screen.]
Plankton: [off-screen] No! I don't wanna get sick too! Stay away! No! [sneezes of his clam flu] Ah, barnacles.",0.40,Andrew Goodman

Meanwhile, Plankton is home after failing to steal the formula again. He sees the sea chimps and shrinks himself to their size so he can practice ruling the world. He gets the sea chimps to all be slaves by overthrowing the king, who was rather happy with this, as well as getting a castle all to himself. While riding an old chimp, another one shoots a dart at him, causing him to collapse. Afterward, Plankton finds himself tied onto sacrificial poles as a tongue from above comes down to lick him.He bites the tongue, revealing it to be Patrick's, who starts drinking all the water in the aquarium, but before all the sea chimps get swallowed, Plankton and the Sea Chimp King puts them all within Plankton's shrinking belt to cushion his landing. When they get eaten, SpongeBob arrives and sees in horror that Patrick was the one eating his sea chimps the whole time, not Gary. Denying such an allegation, Patrick walks out. Right after, the sea chimps and Plankton grow to larger size while expanding Patrick's belly when the king touches the dial on the belt. Seeing that his lie was exposed, Patrick sheepishly admits to eating them and says the sea monkeys were not that good.The sea monkeys then get out of Patrick's stomach. SpongeBob greets them, stating he is their master, but they refuse to serve as pets anymore and decide to live in the Chum Bucket, causing Karen to panic and abandon the restaurant. Plankton concludes that they cannot stay in the Chum Bucket anymore and launches the restaurant several miles away from him, with all the sea monkeys inside. The episode ends with Plankton getting eaten by Patrick and his crown coming out of Patrick's mouth.",King Plankton,"[The episode begins with a group of strange creatures called sea chimps singing in harmony while doing their daily chores. Suddenly, everything starts shaking and the sea chimps screech in fear. It turns out that they reside in an aquarium owned by SpongeBob. SpongeBob is dragging the aquarium down the street singing the same tune as the sea chimps. Fred and his wife are having a date at café when SpongeBob passes by singing and hopping around while dragging his aquarium.]
Fred: You know that child we were planning on having?
Fred and his wife: Let's forget it.
[SpongeBob skids the aquarium to the front doors of the Chum Bucket where he meets up with Karen.]
Karen: SpongeBob, I could hear you caterwauling a mile away.
SpongeBob: Aw, thanks, [hops off the aquarium] and thanks for watching my sea chimps while I'm at work. [inhales and blows out his work hat from his head]
Karen: They're already in an aquarium. Why don't you just leave 'em at home?
SpongeBob: [puts earphones over the aquarium and leans in closer so Karen could hear] I think Gary might be trying to eat them. I found saliva on the glass.
Karen: So what do I need to do for them?
SpongeBob: Nothing! They'll take care of themselves. Oh! [feels the wind] Hm! [takes out an umbrella] Well, I got to go. Here's my breeze. [opens his umbrella and flies away with the wind] Whoa-ow-ow-ow!
[Meanwhile at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs has once again prevented Plankton from stealing the Krabby Patty formula and is carrying him out of the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: When will you ever learn that a tiny pipsqueak like you will never, ever take over anything? [stretches and squishes Plankton like putty] What do you call this gizmo you made anyway? [points to a very odd-looking device that is completely unfinished]
[Plankton's device goes haywire and puffs smoke in Plankton's face.]
Plankton: [coughs] The Takeover-er-er.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] That's just stupid. [stretches and flings Plankton back to the Chum Bucket]
SpongeBob: [flying by Plankton] Morning.
Plankton: Morning…
Mr. Krabs: And don't forget your rube goldfish device! [picks out the machine and hurls it away] There we go.
[Plankton lands at the front doors of the restaurant as usual. But as he got back up, the machine runs on him. Plankton crawls out from under the doors. Plankton straightens his out his back before entering the main room.]
Plankton: Honey, I'm home. [sees SpongeBob's aquarium near the doors] What's this stupid thing?
Karen: Those are SpongeBob's sea chimps. You don't need to bother with them. I'm going back to my shows now. [turns on the screen and watches her soap opera through the mirror; she sees two women fighting and slapping each other] Oh, my!
Plankton: Hmm. Huh? Sea chimps, huh? [gets a closer look through the glass and sees sea chimps continuing their happy-go-lucky lives] Wait a minute. Maybe I've been going about this world conquest thing all wrong. Maybe I should start small and work my way up! [cackles evilly]
[The scene changes to Plankton climbing up the aquarium wearing a shrinking belt.]
Plankton: This shrink belt will allow me to walk among those little monkeys. [turns the dial and shrinks smaller] Alley-oop!
[Plankton jumps and dives down the aquarium. He dives through the clouds and cackles evilly once more before landing in a pile of bananas. One sea chimp, mistaking him for a banana, grabs Plankton, peels his skin and prepares to eat him.]
Plankton: Too small, too small! [turns dial, makes himself bigger, and pulls himself out of the sea chimp's mouth] Huh?
[All of the sea chimps look at Plankton with bizarre looks. They had never seen another creature that is not of their kind in their aquarium before. Plankton then examines the sea chimps and notices that he's taller than them.]
Plankton: [giggles] Hey, why are you idiots so short? [picks up a sea chimp and forms it into a ball; he bounces it and throws it away] You afraid of me? You gonna cry?
[Plankton flicks a baby sea chimp's banana lollipop to the ground and makes it cry. All of the sea chimps run around in fright, screeching and chattering. Plankton grabs three sea chimps and ties them up together.]
Plankton: Listen here, you pint-sized twerps. I'm taking over your monkey town, see? [the sea chimps chatter nervously] Do you little cretins have a king or a queen or something?
[The sea chimps push one of their kind to show Plankton their ruler. It is a purple sea chimp with a gold crown.]
Sea chimp king: Um, I am the king.
Plankton: Yeah? Well, now I'm the king! [takes the crown from the sea chimp king and puts it on his head]
Sea chimp king: Wow! [shakes Plankton's hand] Thank you, sir! I mean, sire. [hops away] I'm not the king! I'm not the king! I'm not the king! I'm not the king-ing-ing!
Plankton: Why was that so easy? It's so easy because I'm so big and smart! [buffs up his muscles] That's why! [slips on a banana peel and falls backwards] Well, what are you all waiting for? Follow your leader! Fall! [the sea chimps obey their ""king"" and fall on the ground]
[The scene changes to Plankton taking over the aquarium's castle. He decorated the throne room with portraits and statues of himself. Some of the portraits have Mr. Krabs and Karen on them. Plankton is sitting on his new throne and has made the sea chimps his loyal servants. Some of them gave Plankton their gold and jewelry.]
Plankton: That's right, bring me all your valuables. [an elderly sea chimp holding a big bowl of bananas reveals dentures in his mouth] What are those? Dentures? Hand them over. [the old sea chimp gives Plankton his dentures and puts them in his mouth] Now that's more like it. I want to be the only one in town with stuff! [slips on another banana peel and falls backwards, losing his dentures and crown; the sea chimps fall down as well; Plankton picks up the crown and puts it back on] I'm tired of walking. Carry me!
[The scene changes to the sea chimps carrying Plankton on his throne. Plankton is eating grapes. He takes a grape and throws it in one of the sea chimps' face.]
Sea chimp child: Father! [goes back to licking her lollipop]
Plankton: [laughs] Right in the head! You guys are idiots. I'm the smart one. I've got the best ideas. Hey, you! Here's a grape-flavored idea! [picks a grape and throws it] Hi-yah! [throws three grapes at three sea chimps] Okay, that's enough. I'm bored.
[The sea chimps set Plankton down. Plankton rides a motor bike out from the castle window and drives down the village.]
Plankton: Yeah! [points to various sea chimps as he gloats and drives] I rule you, I rule you, I rule you. I rule you, you, you, and you. [crashes into a fire hydrant and is sent flying onto the back of an old sea chimp lady] Ow! [the sea chimps look at him in confusion] Ta-da! Piggyback for the king! Let's see how fast this old lady can go. [pulls on the old sea chimp lady's hair and kicks her] Hi-yah!
[The old sea chimp lady runs and gallops around like a horse.]
Plankton: Yee-haw! Today, sea chimps, tomorrow, the world! [as Plankton rides the old sea chimp lady down the path, one sea chimp pops out from a bush and shoots a dart] I rule you, I rule you, [gets hit in the head by the dart] and I...rule...you...
[Plankton falls backwards and groans on impact as the screen turns black. Plankton wakes up from his coma and finds himself tied in between two sacrificial poles.]
Plankton: Hey, what is this? Where am I? Okay, ha-ha. Very humorous. Having a bit of fun with the king, [chuckles] I get it. I think my armpits are dry now. You can cut me down. [the sea chimps continue to stare angrily at Plankton] I demand you obey your king! Let's go! Come on, you little bozos! Get me down! [the sea chimps no longer listens to him] Guys? My people? Loyal subjects? [gulps nervously] Buddies?
Sea chimp king: Oh! Hello! Remember me? You took my crown and became the new king? I just wanted to say thanks again. Oh, and, uh, have a nice sacrifice! [leaves]
Plankton: Sacrifice?
Sea chimps: [chanting ""tongue""]
Plankton: Tongue? That's a weird request. But as king I'll be benevolent. [sticks out his tongue; suddenly, drops of water come raining down; one drop hits Plankton's eye] Gah! What in Neptune's navel?!
[Just then, as the sea chimps continue chanting, a giant pink tongue descends downward from the clouds and begins attacking Plankton.]
Plankton: [dodges the tongue's attacks] Hey! Whoa! [gets licked by the tongue] Yuck! Time to un-shrink! [tries to reach the dial on his belt, but couldn't due his hands being tied up] Can't...reach...I take it back. I don't want to be king!
Sea chimp king: Nuh-uh-uh! No takee-backsees.
[The tongue closes in on Plankton. The sea chimp king runs off to prevent himself from being licked. Just as the tongue was about to attack again, Plankton bites the tongue and sends it packing.]
Sea chimps: Aww!
Plankton: What do you mean, ""aww?"" Don't aww!
[The scene cuts back to the Chum Bucket. It turns out that the tongue belongs to Patrick. It also turns out that Patrick was the one trying to eat SpongeBob's sea chimps, not Gary.]
Patrick: Ow! [pulls his tongue back out of the aquarium] That hurt! [his tongue was a severe bite mark; he giggles] Now that snack's got a bite. [picks up the aquarium and drinks the water]
[Due to Patrick moving the aquarium, the sea chimps fall down Patrick's throat. Three sea chimps bind together like barrel monkey toys to prevent themselves from falling further. Plankton is left dangling above Patrick's mouth.]
Sea chimp king: Oh, don't worry, sire! I will cut you loose from the sacrifice. [gnaws on the rope that's holding Plankton's right hand]
Plankton: Hey, stop! Nice old chimp king. Don't do that!
[The sea chimp king cuts through the rope and Plankton swings to the other sacrificial pole. Plankton sees most of the sea chimps descending down Patrick's throat. Patrick continues drinking the aquarium's water. The sea chimp king saws the other rope that's holding Plankton's left hand.]
Plankton: Huh? How did you get over there? [the sea chimp king cuts the rope and Plankton falls] Ahh!
Sea chimp king: [falls alongside Plankton] Hey, you're welcome!
Plankton: Hey, dumbbell! [takes off his shrink belt] Take this end of the belt and wrap it around all the other falling numbskulls and bring it back to me! [stretches the shrink belt] It stretches. Go! [they both wraps the shrink belt around the other sea chimps] You morons should cushion my fall nicely.
[Plankton and the sea chimps all fall down Patrick's throat. Just then, SpongeBob comes back from the Krusty Krab and enters the Chum Bucket. He sees Patrick drinking the aquarium water.]
SpongeBob: [screams] Oh, oh, oh! Patrick! It was you trying to eat my sea chimps the whole time.
[Patrick puts the aquarium down and exit the Chum Bucket in a huff. SpongeBob follows him outside.]
Patrick: I can't believe you'd accuse me of-of-of such a delicious thing! [belches and his stomach rumbles]
[SpongeBob hears his sea chimps chattering in Patrick's stomach.]
SpongeBob: I hear 'em in there. [forms an ear and listens carefully]
Sea chimp king: [inside Patrick's stomach] Hey, King, what's this dialy-doodle-mojig on your belt do?
Plankton: [inside Patrick's stomach] No, don't touch that!
[The sea chimp king turns the dial on Plankton's shrink belt and Patrick's body begins growing and expanding.]
Patrick: Whoa-oh-oh-oh! [the growing stops and it gives Patrick a bad taste of indigestion] I take it back. They weren't that delicious.
[The sea chimp king crawls out from Patrick's mouth.]
Sea chimp king: Whoa! Hey, guys, come on out! There's more room out here.
[All of the sea chimp crawl out of Patrick's body. Patrick flips himself over and sticks his tongue out. Plankton appears to be partially digested and bruised from being inside Patrick's stomach.]
Plankton: [his right antennae is damaged] Partially digested antennae.
SpongeBob: Welcome, sea chimps. I'm SpongeBob, your owner.
Sea chimp king: Forget it, man. We're through with owners, and kings, and aquariums. Whoa! Now that looks like a swell place to live.
[All the sea chimps run into the Chum Bucket. Karen comes out with banana peels all over her monitor.]
Karen: [screams] Plankton! Abandon bucket!
Plankton: Well, that's a write off. [takes out a remote and pushes a button]
[The button activates the Chum Bucket's hand. The hand picks up the restaurant and spins it around and around. The hand throws the restaurant out into the distance with the sea chimps still inside.]
SpongeBob: Bye, sea chimps! Have a good flight! It was so nice of you to help relocate the sea chimps, Plankton. You rule!

SpongeBob tries to put a miniature tank under Gary to fix this issue, but this does not work. Afterwards, SpongeBob decides to create legs for Gary by taking off his legs, as he can regrow his legs. SpongeBob makes Gary practice using his legs and then they go to the park.Everyone at the park gets impressed by Gary's spongy legs. However, Gary gets angry at a worm jealous of his legs and kicks the worm and the owner. Gary continues to kick other people until everyone gets scared and SpongeBob brings him back home. He is too tired to open the door, but since Gary does not have arms, he is unable to open the door. This prompts SpongeBob to add arms onto Gary as well.When Gary gets his arms to work, Gary starts pampering SpongeBob. A weekend later, SpongeBob realizes he needs to go to work, but is unable to reach there as his body parts are worn out from all the pampering. At the Krusty Krab, a customer gets annoyed because his Krabby Patty has slime. Mr. Krabs investigates the issue and sees that Gary has taken over SpongeBob's job as the fry cook.Mr. Krabs decides to go to SpongeBob's house to see what is going on with him, leaving Squidward in charge of the restaurant. He sees that SpongeBob has transformed into a snail, while Gary, who walks into the pineapple home at the same moment, acts the way SpongeBob used to do. Mr. Krabs gets frightened and goes into the house to try to snap SpongeBob out of being a snail. He gets SpongeBob to turn back to normal by giving him a Krabby Patty to smell. He then cuts off Gary's arms and legs in order to turn everything back to normal. The episode ends with SpongeBob and Gary sleeping at night, switching the places where they are sleeping.",Gary's Got Legs,"[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Gary doing their morning exercises. SpongeBob stretches his legs really long and Gary stretches his eyestalks. They lose their balance and fall over.]
SpongeBob: Okay, that's enough stretching.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Now we're ready for a morning jog.
Gary: Meow!
[SpongeBob puts the leash on Gary's snail and goes to walk him. But Gary pulls him back and crashes into SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Gary? Don't you like jogging?
Gary: Meow, meow, meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, right. You're a snail. Hm. We've got to find a way to get you moving.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob creating a tank for Gary to ride on.]
SpongeBob: [picks Gary up] This should do it. [places Gary on the tank] You'll ""tank"" me later. [laughs]
[SpongeBob jogs in place and the tank begins to move. Then they both proceed their morning jog.]
SpongeBob: Hey, now you're moving.
[Suddenly, the tank malfunctions and begins to drive out of control.]
Gary: Meow, meow!
SpongeBob: [gets run over by the tank] Whoa—ow! [appears flattened and injured] I'm okay. [gets run over again] Ow! [gets run over again] Ow! [gets run over again] Yow!
[The tank repeatedly runs over SpongeBob until he is completely flattened. The tank crashes into the lamppost, sending Gary flying.]
Gary: Meow! [lands upside-down on his shell]
[Gary tries to get himself up, but fails. SpongeBob pulls out a sponge-shaped cookie cutter and cuts himself free. He then rushes over to Gary.]
SpongeBob: Aww, poor Gary. [picks up Gary] Looks like you could use a leg up. [comes up with an idea] Or maybe two.
[Gary whimpers in worry. The scene changes to SpongeBob making something out of wood with some wood-carving tools.]
SpongeBob: [removes goggles] There! A perfect set of legs. [reveals to have made a wooden table as he blows the wood dust off] Now let's make some for you.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob wearing a doctor's mask and Gary is on the operating table.]
SpongeBob: This will only hurt for a second. [pulls his legs off] Yow! [reproduces new legs and pushes the button to activate the table]
Gary: [flies upward] Meow! [lands on his shell and SpongeBob places the legs underneath Gary] Meow.
SpongeBob: [kicks the table away and sets Gary down] Voilà! What do you think, Gary?
Gary: [looks at his new legs] Me—ow, meow—meow.
SpongeBob: Let's try 'em out. Come on. Come to SpongeBob.
Gary: Hm. [struggles to walk, but is having a hard time]
SpongeBob: Oh, your first steps.
Gary: Meow. [nearly falls over but continues to walk]
SpongeBob: My little guy's growing up. [catches Gary after successfully walking to him] Now let's try something a little harder.
[SpongeBob bends his legs up and down. Gary does the same. SpongeBob does some kicks with his legs.]
Gary: [does some kicks with his new legs] Meow, meow, meow.
SpongeBob: Ooh, not bad. Try this. [performs an Irish jig]
Gary: [performs an Irish jig with his new legs] Meow, meow, meow, meooow!
SpongeBob: Nice moves. [does the Irish jig with Gary, but ends up getting his feet tangled] Ow! [falls over] Ah! [gasps] The student has surpassed the master.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob preparing another walk with Gary to show off his new legs.]
SpongeBob: Ready to stretch your stuff, Gare-bear?
Gary: Meow, meow. [begins running with his new legs] Meow!
SpongeBob: Hey, wait! [gets dragged by Gary] Whoa!
Gary: Meow, meow. [stops at the gate of the snail park]
SpongeBob: Oh! [flips over and backward] Oy. [gets himself up and removes Gary's leash] After you.
Gary: Meow, meow.
[SpongeBob and Gary enter the snail park. As they wonder around, the people and their pets look in awe at Gary's new limbs. They had never seen a snail with legs before.]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, that's right. You're not dreaming. Check it out. Snail with legs, people.
[SpongeBob and Gary walk up to Lady Upturn and her snail.]
Gary: Meow. [winks at Lady Upturn's snail and growls flirtatiously]
[Lady Upturn's snail purrs daintily.]
Bikini Bottomites: Would you look at that. Well, that's certainly different.
[A worm looks at Gary's new legs and sniffs at them. Gary hisses angrily and the worm barks back at the legged snail. Gary kicks the worm with his new legs and sends the worm flying over to its owner, who gets really angry.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Gary!
Worm owner: Hey, control your snail, fella!
SpongeBob: Sorry. Guess Gary's new legs got him a little excited.
[The worm blows a raspberry at Gary.]
Gary: [hisses angrily and kicks the worm and its owner with his new legs] Pow!
Worm owner: You'll be hearing from my lawyer! [pops in the sky]
[The other people and their pets see this and get really angry.]
Bikini Bottomites: What is your problem, man?
[Just when the people and their pets are about to beat them up, Gary uses his new legs to kick them. Gary goes to beat up the other people with his new legs.]
SpongeBob: Oh, wh—s—sorry!
[Everyone runs out of the snail park in fear.]
Fred: His legs!
SpongeBob: Gary the snail, that was very naughty!
Gary: [licks SpongeBob's hand] Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh. [laughs] I can't stay mad at you. [pets Gary and puts the leash back on his shell]
Gary: [runs off with his new legs] Meow!
SpongeBob: [gets pulled forward] Whoa!
[Gary pulls SpongeBob really hard until he reaches to the pineapple house's front door. SpongeBob collapses from exhaustion.]
SpongeBob: [tries to open the door, but is too tired] I'm a little beat, Gary. Can you give me a hand with the door?
Gary: Meow—ow. [tries to open the door, but ends up getting his eyestalks tangled]
SpongeBob: Looks like I should give you a hand, huh?
[The scene changes to SpongeBob examining Gary with a measuring tape.]
SpongeBob: Hm? Hm. Hmm. [produces two extra arms for Gary] Uh-huh. Uh-huh. [takes the arms] Yow! [breaks them apart and sticks them onto Gary] They look a little tight in the shoulder.
Gary: [looks at his new arms] Meow—meow, meow—meow. [points out that SpongeBob gave him two left-handed arms]
SpongeBob: Whoops! I accidentally gave you two left hands. [pulls the pinky and makes it into the perfect right hand] Boop! Perfect. Give 'em a test drive, Gary.
Gary: [struggles to move his new arms] Meow, meow, meow... [his arms fall downward; he tries to pull them up, but they're too heavy]
SpongeBob: Maybe you just need some motivation. [holds out a can of snail food]
Gary: Meow. [struggles to move his new arms to reach for the can of snail food, but squeezes SpongeBob's eyes by accident] Meow!
SpongeBob: [yelps in pain] You're doing it, Gary. Yes, yes! Keep it up, keep it up! [get slapped in the face by Gary's new arms] Ow! Yes, yes!
Gary: [slaps SpongeBob's face] Meow!
SpongeBob: That's it, Gary. [gets slapped again] Move the— [gets slapped again] Move the— [gets slapped again] Move those arms.
[The scene changes to Gary trying out various things with his new arms.]
Gary: Meow—ow—ow—ow—ow—ow. [flips the light switch on and off; then he goes to open the front door and sees Patrick] Meow? [slams the door before Patrick could say anything] Meow.
[Gary happily runs up and down the stairs while carrying SpongeBob and laughing. Gary then feeds SpongeBob some food in the kitchen. He imitates a train sound before stuffing SpongeBob's mouth with the food. SpongeBob talks to Gary with his mouth full. He points out that he can't chew his food on his own.]
Gary: [annoyed] Meow. [moves SpongeBob's mouth up and down to help him chew the food]
French Narrator: One Weekend of Pampering Later...
[SpongeBob is shown resting on the couch with a blanket. Gary gives SpongeBob a cup of hot chocolate and sits next to him to watch some television. Suddenly, SpongeBob's head starts to shake.]
SpongeBob: Ow! [sticks out his tongue and sees an alarm clock ringing] Yikes! Look at the time! I gotta get to the Krusty Krab. [throws the clock away] Thanks for spoiling me, Gary. I didn't have to lift a ""finger."" [pulls the blanket off and sees his own limbs old and worn out] My fingers... [goes to walk] Wha—! [but falls over] A whole weekend of pampering has left my limbs in limbo. [drags across the floor with his tongue] Got. To go. To work. [crawls over to the front door and sees his hat] Hm? [tries to reach it, but falls over; his limbs wither and curl up, leaving SpongeBob completely motionless] Too weak to flip Krabby Patties. [whimpers]
[Gary walks over to SpongeBob. He takes pity on poor SpongeBob for having his limbs become worn out from all the pampering.]
Gary: [sympathetically] Ooh. Uh-oh.
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab. The customers are eating their patties, but they find snail slime on them, much to their disgust. One customer eats it, but becomes grossed out. He walks over to Mr. Krabs.]
Customer #1: Excuse me, but I would like to complain!
Mr. Krabs: I see. Well, the Krusty Krab takes customers feedback very seriously, sir. After they pay the $5.00 complaint fee.
Customer #1: All right, fine. [reluctantly gives Mr. Krabs $5.00]
Mr. Krabs: Yee—hee—hee—hee. [turns his head and places the dollar in it] Thank you, sir. Now what seems to be your problem?
Customer #1: There is slime on my patty!
Customer #2: And mine has— [eats his slime-covered patty] slime on it, too.
Incidental 20: My patty doesn't have enough slime! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: What? Give me that. [eats the slime-covered patty, but spits it out] Bleh! Ugh! Gah! SpongeBob! Just what do you think you're doing [enters the kitchen] changing me patty... [sees Gary at the grill] formula?
Gary: [tips his hat] Meow. Meow—mow. [flips patties but leaves a mess of slime]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! Why is there a mollusk cooking me Krabby Patties?
Squidward: I thought it was strangely quiet and peaceful today.
Mr. Krabs: Where the halibut is SpongeBob?
Squidward: Maybe he quit? Or got hit by a bus?! Or caught a terminal disease!
Mr. Krabs: I don't care if he turned into a bucket of chum. I need me fry cook! [leaves to go check on SpongeBob] Mr. Squidward, you have the helm. [exits the restaurant]
Squidward: [speaks through megaphone] Attention Krusty Krab customers: Get out. It's time for my break.
[The customers leave the restaurant. Mr. Krabs knocks on the front door to SpongeBob's house.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Are you okay in there? You catch the flu or something? Ugh. Are you at death's door? Because you know darn well they ain't valid excuses to miss work! [peeks through the window and finds to his shocking surprise that SpongeBob is slithering on the floor with his tongue like a snail; SpongeBob eats some food from Gary's food bowl] Ah! SpongeBob has gone full raving loony. [hears something] Uh-oh! [hides underground as Gary appears]
Gary: ♪Meow—meow—meow—meow—meow—meow—meow. Meow—meow—meow—meow—meow—meow.♪ [enters the house]
[Mr. Krabs peeks through the window again. He sees SpongeBob rubbing his head against the chair while Gary's reading the paper. Gary pets SpongeBob and holds out a snail toy for him to play. SpongeBob plays the toy with his eye. Mr. Krabs gasps and drills himself inside through the floor.]
Gary: Meow?
Mr. Krabs: What in the name of Neptune's nostrils is going on in here?! SpongeBob, you're acting like you're the pet and that darn snail is the owner!
Gary: [hits Mr. Krabs with the toy] Meow! Meow—meow—meow.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs the toy] Bad snail! Down boy! [gets attacked by SpongeBob] SpongeBob, what are you— [gets licked and pummeled by SpongeBob until he pushes him off and shakes him violently] Oh, snap out of it, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob doesn't respond. Mr. Krabs pulls out a Krabby Patty, breaks it in half and puts it under SpongeBob's nose. SpongeBob smells the patty's scent and shakes himself back to normal, snapping himself out of the strange trance.]
SpongeBob: [dazed] Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Have you completely lost your mind, boy-o? Snails ain't supposed to have arms and legs.
SpongeBob: Aww, but Gary is so happy with his new limbs.
[Gary files his new arms.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, is he? Well, it's time to cut this nonsense! [growls and goes to fight Gary] Ay! [growls at Gary viciously] Huh-hah!
[Mr. Krabs leaps over to Gary and cuts the arms and legs, returning Gary back to his normal self.]
Gary: [sniffs the severed limbs] Meow. [slithers over to his food bowl, removes SpongeBob's name and goes to eat his food]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry I forgot who I was.
Mr. Krabs: That's okay, boy-o.
SpongeBob: And Gary, I am so sorry I tried to change you.
[Gary belches and proceeds to eat his food.]
SpongeBob: And Patrick, I'm sorry I haven't returned your hat yet. [shows an enormous hat with a train on it]
Patrick: [sobs quietly and hugs SpongeBob before getting his hat back] It's okay... [leaves]
SpongeBob: [sees the severed limbs walking away] Hm? [grabs a severed arm] Well, I guess I shouldn't let these go to waste. I can always use an extra hand [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: [picks up SpongeBob] All right, all right. That's enough Sponge-bobbery for today, boy-o. [holds out the spatula] Time to get you flipping patties again. [leaves for the Krusty Krab with SpongeBob]
[The scene changes to nighttime and SpongeBob and Gary are getting ready for bed.]
SpongeBob: Ah, sure is nice having everything back to normal, isn't it Gare-bear? [climbs into bed] Yup. Same old, same old.
[After a brief silence, SpongeBob and Gary look at each other.]
Gary: Meow—ow. [slithers onto the bed while SpongeBob goes to sleep on the floor; they both sigh] Meow. Meow.
SpongeBob: Oops! Sorry. [his severed arms come out from under the bed and claps] Boop-boop.
[The lights turn off and the screen becomes black, ending the episode.]",1.21,Luke Brookshier

An officer takes Plankton to the police station with Mr. Krabs tagging along. The officer realizes the station is full and lets go of Plankton, wishing there was another prison. Mr. Krabs says he will turn his restaurant into a prison, and rolls a bowling ball with Plankton on it into the Krusty Krab to start holding a prison.Plankton, trying to get out of prison, tricks Mr. Krabs and tries to escape, but ends up failing. Mr. Krabs puts Plankton in SpongeBob's hole as a punishment for doing this, and at the same time, the same officer comes back to send more prisoners to the Krusty Krab. After that, the Krusty Krab starts having cells within the restaurant to hold all the prisoners. Mr. Krabs then lets Plankton get out of the hole, only to punish him again by putting him inside the secret formula bottle with the formula itself outside of it.SpongeBob sends mail to all the prisoners, while Mr. Krabs continues to severely punish Plankton. The officer comes back again to tell Mr. Krabs that Plankton has served his punishment and is getting released. As he is walking out, Plankton tells Mr. Krabs that he hopes what he is doing is worth paying for. It turns out the prisoners are enjoying many luxuries due to SpongeBob taking care of them. Mr. Krabs gets angry and takes away all these luxuries from the prisoners. They get mad and start throwing tomatoes at Mr. Krabs, causing the regular customers at the restaurant to leave. This makes Mr. Krabs angry enough to release all the prisoners so he does not have to deal with them anymore.Later that night, all the prisoners come to SpongeBob to tell him they miss being at the prison because of him. SpongeBob creates a plan to get them all back in the prison, and the next day, Mr. Krabs sees all the prisoners in his restaurant again. This makes Mr. Krabs mad because he just released them the other night, but SpongeBob tries to tell him that he should not say that, as the officer is eating at the restaurant right at that time and tells him releasing prisoners early is a crime. She then arrests Mr. Krabs for admitting his act, as he realizes his error until telling SpongeBob to set a massage appointment for him. The officer says the Krusty Krab is full, so she sends Mr. Krabs to another jail as he realizes where it is: the Chum Bucket. There, Mr. Krabs is placed in a cage, while a vengeful Plankton takes full advantage of this and happily feeds buckets of chum to the crying Krabs, as the episode ends.",The Krusty Slammer,"[The episode begins with Plankton vandalizing the Krusty Krab with red paint.]
Plankton: [cackling] Yes! My plan is working! [throws away paint brush and throws a bucket full of paint at the restaurant's windows] Now everyone in town will know what a jerk Krabs is. Yeah! [the scene pans out to reveal that he drew pictures of Mr. Krabs and wrote threatening messages all over the restaurant and all of Bikini Bottom; as he laughs evilly, a police woman comes in and handcuffs him] Huh?
Lady officer: Hey, you! [pokes him with her batting stick] You're under arrest.
Plankton: Arrest? For what? I didn't even steal anything this time.
Mr. Krabs: Vandalism's a crime too. You've been caught red-handed, Plankton.
Plankton: Eh, should've used the green paint.
Mr. Krabs: I usually laugh all the way to the bank. [rubs Plankton's cheeks] But for you, Plankton, I'll laugh all the way to the clink! [laughs as he escorts the cop to the Bikini Bottom Jail where she will lock up Plankton]
Lady officer: Oh no, the prison is full! [the scene shows Bikini Bottom Jail completely overcrowded with criminals] Looks like we'll just have to set you free.
Mr. Krabs: [his jaw dropped in shock] What, free?! But he's a criminal!
Lady officer: Well, you know what they say. Don't stop the crime if you can't enforce the time.
Plankton: [laughs as he escapes the handcuff's clutches] Eat it, Krabs! I'm off to re-offend. [leaves with a paint brush]
Lady officer: It's a shame that there's no other place in Bikini Bottom to hold our extra criminals. 'Cause we'd give that place a lot of money. [holds out a pile of money]
Mr. Krabs: [giggles as his head changes into a gold coin; he shakes the officer's hand] You got yourself a deal! [stomps on Plankton so he wouldn't escape] We can lock him up at my place, [pulls Plankton back] the Krusty Krab.
Lady officer: Well then, [holds up a shackle with an iron ball] this is for the prisoner. [crushes Plankton with the iron ball] And here's your cash. [hands Mr. Krabs the pile of money]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Whoa. [giggles as he takes the money pile and makes a coat out of them; he puts on his money coat] Thank you, Madame Officer.
[Mr. Krabs takes the iron ball and rolls Plankton over to the Krusty Krab. Meanwhile, Squidward is busy scraping gum off under one of the tables.]
Squidward: Oh, stupid barnacles, tartar sauce, fish paste—
[The iron ball rolls through the front doors and flies into Squidward's face. Squidward, in form of bowling pins, is sent flying over to the register boat.]
Mr. Krabs: [cackles] Enjoy your ride, Plankton? [steps on Squidward's hand]
Squidward: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Oh, sorry, Mr. Squidward. Didn't see you there.
[The iron ball falls on Squidward and crushes his head.]
SpongeBob: Oh, what's Plankton doing here, Mr. Krabs? I thought he was going to prison. [lifts the iron ball off of Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: He is. The Krusty Krab is a prison now. [laughs]
SpongeBob: [in a prisoner outfit while holding Plankton and a pennant that reads ""Prison""] Oh, hooray! Prison!
Squidward: [blows air back into his head] Oh, big deal. I've been a prisoner here for years.
Mr. Krabs: [plugs a plunger in Squidward's face] Hardy-har, Mr. Squidward. [gives SpongeBob a bucket of cleaning supplies] You boys get back to work! [grabs Plankton] I'll be guarding Plankton in me office. [cuts to Mr. Krabs putting Plankton in a birdcage in his office] Into your cell, you miscreant! [places Plankton in the cage and crushes him with his iron ball]
Plankton: [shakes his head to pull himself together] All right, I'm out of here. [hops on the iron ball] Uh, pardon me, warden, sir, but is that a pretty penny on the floor?
Mr. Krabs: [rips his magazine and hops off his desk] Where? It's mine! It's mine! I saw it first! [searches the floor for the ""penny""]
Plankton: [laughs as escapes the birdcage and heads for the door] The perfect escape. [all of a sudden, he gets clamped by a foothold trap set up by Mr. Krabs] Yeow! [struggles to break free, but is lifted up by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no you don't. [blows air into Plankton to straighten him out] Trying to escape is bad enough, but lying about a penny? You're going in... [through his eyelids] ... the hole. [goes over to SpongeBob, who is washing the register boat with part of his spongy body] Need one of your holes, boy-o.
SpongeBob: [puts his spongy body part back in place and takes off his hat] You got it, Warden Krabs.
Plankton: Hey, let's not do anything we can't— [gets dropped into SpongeBob's body by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: And don't let him go nowhere!
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir! [plugs his head with a cork]
Plankton: [inside SpongeBob's body] All right, who turned off the lights? [pounds inside SpongeBob's body]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Sorry, sir. Plankton tickles inside of me. [giggles]
Mr. Krabs: That oughta learn him.
Lady officer: Morning, Warden.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, me favorite paying police lady. Here to give me more money?
Lady officer: Yup, more money for more prisoners.
Mr. Krabs: More prisoners?
[A prison truck pulls over and drops off a group of prisoners.]
Prisoner #1: Aye, the Krusty Krab. I used to eat here.
Prisoner #2: What a coincidence. I used to rob here.
[As prisoners line up, a pile of money is given to Mr. Krabs by the police woman.]
Lady officer: So, what do you say, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [laughs wildly and takes the money] I say... lock 'em up! [picks up some money he dropped as the police woman leaves] SpongeBob! Try to prison-up the place for our new guests. I gotta go incarcerate all this cash. [giggles as he enters his office]
SpongeBob: I'll do my best, Warden Krabs, sir!
[SpongeBob goes to redecorate the Krusty Krab as Mr. Krabs picks up some money he dropped outside his office. The scene changes SpongeBob wearing a police hat and a badge while holding the keys. He is walking around and singing to himself. Moments later, Mr. Krabs comes out and takes a look at the Krusty Krab. The restaurant is now redesigned with prison cells for prisoners to sleep in. The Krusty Krab is now dubbed the Krusty Slammer. As prisoners are in their cells, they watch the regular customers eat their meals.]
Mr. Krabs: [whistles] Nice work, boy-o. Very prison-y.
Fred: Hey, uh, what's with all the caged men in here? [a prisoner grabs him by the neck and chokes him] They're making me a little nervous...!
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, um, well we're a prison-themed restaurant now. [secretly makes something with a pencil] Do your time with our new Prison Patty. [holds up a Krabby Patty in a poorly drawn prison-themed box] It's served in a solitary confinement box, has its own prisoner number, and even comes with toy shackles! [holds up a plastic toy shackle]
Fred: Wow!
Prisoner #3: [chokes Fred really hard] Looks delicious.
Mr. Krabs: That's right at the Krusty Krab, you can lock up your hunger and throw away your keys! [the customers chatter in delight] Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Ooh, crisis averted. Okay, time to let Plankton out of the hole. Open her up, boy-o. [SpongeBob removes his hat and unplugs his head] Hmm. [peaks in and sees Plankton becoming hysterical and is mentally going insane; Mr. Krabs reaches in SpongeBob's body and pulls Plankton out] Pull yourself together, prisoner! [slaps Plankton] I got a new cell for you.
[Mr. Krabs takes Plankton back into his office, removes the secret formula from the bottle, and places him inside the bottle.]
Plankton: [sees the formula outside the bottle] The formula?! It's so close... I can almost touch it! No, no, no, no!
Mr. Krabs: [cackles] Good times. Good times.
[The scene changes to nighttime at the Krusty Krab aka Krusty Slammer. The whole place is barricaded with barbwires and steel walls. A search light is shining all over to place to make sure that none of the prisoners escape. SpongeBob comes in with a cart full of mail for the prisoners.]
SpongeBob: Okay, mail call, boys. Let's see, who do we have? [pulls out some letters] Toothy. [gives a letter to Reggie] Four Eyes. [gives a letter to a prisoner with four eyes] Lefty. [gives a letter to prisoner who is facing left] Fats. [gives a letter to a skinny prisoner] Fingers. [gives a letter to a prisoner with loads of fingers all over its body] Einstein. [gives a letter to a floating brain with a mustache; quickly reads off names while throwing letters at a fast pace] Stretch, Chuckles, Bingo, Blammy, Wheels, Boogie, Red, Trip, Winks, Skeeter, Stinky.
Prisoners: Thanks, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No problem, guys.
[SpongeBob rolls the mail cart away. Mr. Krabs is busy continuing his non-stop torture on Plankton. He spins Plankton up and down like a yo-yo. Then he paddles him back and forth like a paddle ball. Then he stretches him and uses him as a jump rope. Just then, the police woman comes in.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, morning, officer.
Lady officer: I'm here to oversee Plankton's release. [holds up Plankton's release form] His sentence is up.
Mr. Krabs: What?! But I have so many more punishments for him!
Plankton: [laughs as the police woman leaves; he breaks free from Mr. Krabs' fist] Enjoy your Plankton-free prison, Eugene. [runs to the door] I hope it's worth what you're paying for it. [laughs as he exits the restaurant/prison]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm? Paying for it? Wonder what he means by that. Huh?
[Mr. Krabs sees Fred in a high-class cell. Fred is fluffing up his pillow and goes to sleep in a warm, comfy bed. Mr. Krabs wails in a shocking surprise. The Tattletale Strangler is seen with facial cream and cucumbers on his eye lids. He drinks some lemonade and goes back to relaxing. One prisoner is putting suntan lotion on another prisoner's back and gives him a massage. Squidward, in fancy clothing, serves a prisoner a plate full of Krabby Patties.]
SpongeBob: More marshmallows for your hot cocoa, Wobbles? [places marshmallows in a prisoner's mug of hot chocolate; in doing so, the drink forms into dollar signs and splashes back in the mug]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing? [slaps SpongeBob's face with his tongue] Do you have any idea how much it costs to make a prison humane? These down comforters, they're two-ply. [rips a comforter off of Fred's bed, making him shiver] This ain't no luxury hotel. [rips the tube out of a prisoner's hot tub] These televisions ain't free! [rips a television off the wall] And neither are these massage chairs. [takes away the massage chair and replaces it with a barrel, making the prisoner cry like a baby] And this your most expensive mistake of all! [takes Krabby Patties out of Sticky Fins' and Dorsal Dan's mouths and stuffs them into the con man's mouth while reaching in his pocket and steals his money] From now on, no more patties for prisoners.
[The prisoners are outraged at Mr. Krabs' cruel treatment and throw tomatoes at him in retaliation.]
Dorsal Dan: Cruel and unusual punishment!
Mr. Krabs: And no more tomatoes either.
[During the riot, the customers get hit by the tomatoes.]
Female customer: Come on, let's find another prison to eat at.
Customers: [as they exit the restaurant/prison in disgust] What a rip-off! / Come on.
Mr. Krabs: No, no! Come back! Come back! I can't afford to lose me paying customers. Oh I'm ruined! [sobs] All right, that's it! [pushes a button on a remote and sets the prisoners free] No more prison. Everyone out. [pushes the prisoners out] Don't care where you go, but you can't stay here. [closes the door] Oh finally. The Krusty Krab is back to being a regular old money-making restaurant. [giggles] Problem solved. [SpongeBob is about to say something against against Krabs' decision, but he cuts him off] I said problem solved! [throws SpongeBob out and heads back into his office in a confident smile]
French Narrator: Later at night...
[The scene changes to SpongeBob's house. A group of strange creatures arrive and sneak inside. SpongeBob is sleeping in his bed and a shadow looms over him. SpongeBob wakes up and screams in fear as if he's seeing a monster. Eyes glow in the dark and surround SpongeBob. He turns on the light and sees that the creatures that came into his house are the prisoners Mr. Krabs kicked out earlier.]
SpongeBob: Oh, it's just my prison pals. What are you guys doing here?
Prisoner #4: We want to go back to the Krusty Krab. We were having fun in there with you. See? [shows a tattoo of himself hugging SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [out of sympathy] Aww. Okay, I'm in. Time for a jail-break-in.
French Narrator: The next day...
[The scene changes the morning at the Krusty Slammer. Mr. Krabs enters the restaurant and prepares to open it for the day, when suddenly...]
Prisoners: Morning, Warden Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Morning, prisoners! [gasps in horror as he sees the prisoners back in their cells] SpongeBob! What is going on here? I set all these criminals free last night! What are they doing back in their cells?!
SpongeBob: Uh, Mr. Krabs, now's probably not the best time to—
[Too late. The police woman had overheard everything Mr. Krabs said about releasing the prisoners the previous night, as he shrinks back in fear. She is seen sitting at a table eating her Krabby Patty.]
Lady officer: You know it's a crime to release prisoners early, don't ya? [eats her patty and approaches Mr. Krabs who realizes his error] You're going to prison, [handcuffs Mr. Krabs] criminal.
Mr. Krabs: What? Oh, well, that's not so bad. Pencil me in for a 3:30 massage, SpongeBob.
Lady officer: [takes Mr. Krabs away] Oh, you're not staying here. The Krusty Krab is full. We got a new prison just for you.
Mr. Krabs: [sadly] Oh no. Let me guess...
[The scene changes to the Chum Bucket where Mr. Krabs is wearing his prison outfit and is placed in the same birdcage he used for Plankton. Mr. Krabs groans sadly.]
Plankton: Mealtime, prisoner! [laughs while throwing spoonfuls of raw chum in Mr. Krabs' face in an act of revenge for the all the painful torture he endured; Mr. Krabs cries with agonizing defeat right before Plankton throws some chum into his mouth] Right in the mouth.",1.24,Andrew Goodman

Everyone in the restaurant then runs out due to Patrick's hideous smells, but when SpongeBob smells his stench, he is amazed at just how smelly he is. After SpongeBob decides to smell Patrick again, Mr. Krabs smells an awful stench and investigates what it is. He finds out that the stench is coming from Patrick, so he kicks him out of the restaurant. This makes Patrick angry and wants to revolt for his stink-dependence.Patrick starts messing around in grimy places of the city, but when he starts messing around in the Dump, he eventually becomes so filthy he is unrecognizable. Patrick starts going around town in this filthy form, causing him to get listed in the newspaper as Filthy Muck. SpongeBob finds out about this news and tries to look for him, eventually finding him at the Dump. Since Filthy Muck has a force-field of stink, SpongeBob puts on a filthy mustache on himself to prevent the smell, but this leads to him getting into Filthy Muck's game and starts to go around in the grime as well.Another news article comes out about how Filthy Muck now has a partner. SpongeBob and Filthy Muck start going all over town, causing people to run away due to their smells, except for Old Man Jenkins, as he cannot smell. Eventually, the citizens have had enough of this, so they confront the two gross creatures and riot against them. SpongeBob cleans himself so they do not riot against him, but he tries to tell the citizens that Filthy Muck is his friend and he does not want him to get hurt. However, the citizens still try to run Filthy Muck out of town.Eventually, SpongeBob tries to clean Filthy Muck, and tells everyone if they work to clean him, he will turn normal again. Everyone does so, but Filthy Muck completely disappears after getting cleaned. It turns out Patrick had gone to take a bath, after he realized he would be forbidden from the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob realizes it was just muck the mob cleaned up. Old Man Jenkins then freaks out after seeing Patrick letting go of his towel, exposing his posterior to everyone. The crowd laughs while on a hill, the Filthy Muck reforms and Rube takes a picture with him as the episode ends.",The Ballad of Filthy Muck,"[The episode begins at Patrick's rock. Patrick, who is incredibly smelly and dirty, yawns and wakes up from his slumber. He takes a sniff of his odor and almost gags. Patrick falls off from the rock as a fancy lady passes by with her worms.]
Lady: [sniffs Patrick's stench and coughs] How unsavory. [grabs her worms and clogs her nose with them]
[The lady leaves and Patrick's rock falls flat. But the smelly odor from Patrick melts the rock. Patrick heads over to the Krusty Krab where his stench melts the sign. He enters the restaurant and his stench causes Squidward and the customers to run out while covering their noses. SpongeBob is minding his own business flipping Krabby Patties on the grill. But Patrick's disgusting smell attracts his attention.]
SpongeBob: [sniffs Patrick's odor and it slaps him] Ow! [turns around and sees a smelly and filthy Patrick in the kitchen; he sniffs him again and gags; he pulls off his nose] Patrick, when was the last time you took a bath?
Patrick: Uh. I can't think that far behind.
SpongeBob: That is the smelliest smell I have ever smelled. It's actually quite impressive.
Patrick: Why thank you!
SpongeBob: Do you, uh, mind if I take another whiff?
Patrick: [lifts his armpit up] Take a crack at it. [SpongeBob sniffs his armpit and his eyes explode] Uh, uh-huh.
[Meanwhile, in Mr. Krabs' office, Mr. Krabs is adding money in his fake bank. He puts a coin on the fake bank and a smaller version of himself takes the coin. Mr. Krabs laughs until he sniffs Patrick's stench.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [sniffs Patrick's stench and gags; he sniffs his armpit] Phew. Nope. [opens his fake bank, takes out his small version of himself and sniffs his armpit] Nope. Hmm. [peeks into the bathroom and sniffs over a customer's stall] Nope. [leaves]
Administrator Flotsam: Huh. Can't please everyone.
Mr. Krabs: Huh. [sees the fumes from Patrick's stench from the kitchen door] Huh? What in Sulfur City? [enters the kitchen] Ah-ha! [grabs Patrick and kicks him out of the restaurant] And don't come back until you've cleaned up your act! [goes back in]
Patrick: Oh, yeah? Well, what if I don't clean up my act, huh? I'm revolting! [his stench wilts some flowers; takes out a roll of toilet paper] I proclam a declamation of stink-dependence! [his stench fumes form into trumpets and they blow musical notes; he pouts] Hmph! [the jellyfish above him falls after smelling his stench as he leaves]
[The scene changes to Patrick swimming in sewage. Patrick then jumps into several garbage cans and playing in the garbage. Then Patrick rolls around in smelly laundry in a men's locker room. Then, later at night, a stinky and filthy Patrick walks past the dump. He takes notice of the filthy stench from the dump and sniffs it. He sighs happily as the gates open and Patrick enters the dump.]
French Narrator: The next... [coughs and gags] The next morning...
[The next day, a filthy and smelly creature covered in muck and sludge wakes up from its slumber. The creature's shape looks ironically similar to Patrick Star. The creature slithers down from the garbage and spreads its smelly stench to Bikini Bottom Park. Joggers run from the creature while covering their noses.]
Man: [passing by and smells the creature's stench] Good Neptune!
Norma Rechid: Oh! [covers her nose]
Tyler: I can't breathe! [Norma puts a gas mask on her son's face] Thank you, Mother.
Rube: Amazing! [snaps a picture of the disgusting creature]
Morty: [holds up a newspaper entitled, ""Filthy Muck Spotted""] Extra, extra! Filthy Muck spotted in town! Mysterious smelly figure terrorizes Bikini Bottom's noses!
Big nose fish: [after reading the newspaper] Jumpin' Jehoshaphat! [takes out a large clothes pin and puts it on his nose]
[The scene changes to customers eating at a nearby café.]
Clay: I don't—I don't really watch, though.
[Suddenly, Filthy Muck's stench rolls in and everyone except Old Man Jenkins runs away covering their noses. Filthy Muck eats Old Man Jenkins' sandwich.]
Old Man Jenkins: Eh, Filthy Muck. You don't scare me. I can't smell. [Filthy Muck belches in his face and leaves] My nose ain't work since the great Sulfur War of '09! Humph! [throws the table over] What are you looking at?!
[Meanwhile, back at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is reading the newspaper with Filthy Muck's picture on it.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I know him! It's Patrick. Filthy Muck is Patrick. [the customer closes the newspaper] Oh, that poor repulsive pile of sludge. All alone without a friend. I gotta find him. I gotta help him. I gotta love him.
[The customers look at SpongeBob with strange expressions on their faces. But they eventually cheered for SpongeBob's friendship for Patrick. SpongeBob removes his nose and puts a collar and leash on it like a dog.]
SpongeBob: [takes out Patrick's shorts] Shablam!
[The nose smells Patrick's shorts and picks up the starfish's smelly scent. The nose pulls SpongeBob out through the front doors and leads him to with his ""friend"" is.]
Frank: See? I told you this town was pet-friendly.
Debbie Rechid: Walkies?
Frank: [puts on a collar and gives Debbie a leash] Oh, boy. [walks and pants like a dog]
[SpongeBob's nose continues to track down Patrick's scent where it leads them to the dump where Patrick was last seen. SpongeBob puts his nose back on his face. The smelly fumes from the dump nearly gags him. He enters the dump while holding his nose closed.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, are you in there?
[SpongeBob hears laughter nearby and sees Filthy Muck rolling around in the garbage. And since Filthy Muck is shaped like a starfish, SpongeBob mistakens the disgusting creature as Patrick.]
Filthy Muck: Yummy.
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick! [goes to hug Filthy Muck as it gets up, but he's too smelly and disgusting] It's like you've got a force-field of stink around you. I can't penetrate it. [the stench pushes SpongeBob back] Hmm. [scoops up some sludge] Hey, maybe a little trash-stachio will neutralize the smell and get m sniffer used to it. [smears the sludge on his and starts to become smelly; he sniffs] Mm-hmm. [gets closer to Filthy Muck] It's working. Should I call you ""Patrick"" or ""Filthy Muck?"" [laughs] I'm gonna call you Filthy Muck. [laughs as he hops in Filthy Muck's arms] Mm-hmm. [grabs some sludge from Filthy Muck's head and spreads it on his head] And you can call me ""Little Yuck."" [he and Filthy Muck laugh]
[The scene changes into a montage of SpongeBob and Filthy Muck playing around in sewage, garbage cans, and dirty laundry just like Patrick did earlier. During the montage, the song, ""The Ballad of Filthy Muck Song"" is played.]

Morty: Extra, extra! Read all about it! Filthy Muck finds playmate! Noses on high alert!
Big nose fish: [reads newspaper and his nose glows red] My schnozzola!
[The scene changes to customers running out of a Bistro restaurant. SpongeBob and Filthy Muck are eating the gourmet foods inside.]
SpongeBob: People left their food behind. [eats some food with Filthy Muck] Shouldn't go to waste.
Old Man Jenkins: I don't care how many of you there are, you don't scare me! I can't smell! [coughs]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Filthy Muck scaring people away with their stench at an outdoor theater. SpongeBob and Filthy Muck climb on the stage.]
SpongeBob: Huh, people left their instruments behind. Shouldn't go to waste. [plays music with Filthy Muck]
Old Man Jenkins: Boo! I can't smell, but you two stink! [laughs]
[The scene changes to Glove World!. The amusement park is completely deserted mostly due to SpongeBob and Filthy Muck's foul stench. SpongeBob and Filthy Muck are seen riding on the roller coaster. The ride reaches back to the boarding station.]
SpongeBob: Wow, I never knew how great smelling bad can be. There are no lines for anything. How you doing back there, Old Man Jenkins?
Old Man Jenkins: [removes the sludge from his face] I'm not—
SpongeBob: Yeah we know. ""Not scared 'cause you can't smell."" [laughs] We love you, man. [cuts back to the dump where SpongeBob and Filthy Muck are lying down looking at the starry sky; sighs] Today was a beautiful day, Patrick. Oops, I mean Filthy Muck. [laughs] Ah, just look at the beautiful stars in the sky. [sees something below] And look at the stars down there on the ground. [the ""stars"" turn out to be an angry mob] Oh, they're not stars. They're flames on sticks. Hi, everybody. [slides down the sludge and Filthy Muck follows] We having a luau?
Con man: Luau nothing! We're running you and your stinky friend out of town!
[The mob shouts in agreement.]
SpongeBob: But it's me, SpongeBob! [wipes the sludge clean off his body, puts on his Krusty Krab work hat, and holds up a spatula] Bikini Bottom's favorite fry cook?
[The mob utters while thinking it over and remember SpongeBob.]
Con man: All right, well you can stay if you clean up your act. But he's gotta go!
SpongeBob: [tries to protect Filthy Muck] No please! I'll clean him up! I promise! [grabs Filthy Muck and runs away]
[The angry mob chases SpongeBob and Filthy Muck. The chase goes to the Boat Wash, where a clean boat comes out. SpongeBob tries to clean Filthy Muck in the Boat Wash, but nothing helps.]
SpongeBob: Nope, still filthy. [runs away]
[The angry mob runs through the Boat Wash, but the water inside puts out the torches.]
Frankie Billy: Did you bring any matches?
Henry-Bart: Nah, I didn't bring any matches.
Frankie Billy: To the flame store!
[The angry mob goes to relight their torches. SpongeBob is at the dry cleaning place where he tries to dry clean Filthy Muck. But when the clerk returns him to SpongeBob, nothing helped.]
Dry cleaning clerk: We couldn't get the stain out.
SpongeBob: Uh, thanks anyway! [runs off as the angry mob bursts through the window and continues to chase them; SpongeBob tries to wash the sludge off of Filthy Muck with the hose, but nothing is working] Huh? [the angry mob closes in on them and are about to destroy Filthy Muck] No! Patrick's my best friend! Please, put down your torches and pick up mops and soap! We can clean him. That would solve everything.
Con man: Can I rub real hard to express my anger?! [pants]
SpongeBob: Yeah I guess so.
Con man: [growls] Good!
Angry mob: [calms down as they put down their torches and pitchforks and hold up mops, brooms, brushes and buckets of soap and water] Yeah!
[SpongeBob and the mob rub and scrub the muck and sludge off of Filthy Muck. But once they were finished, Filthy Muck was gone. Everyone gasps in surprise.]
SpongeBob: [looks through the remains] Where'd he go? There's nothing there! He was the muck! Oh, Patrick!
Patrick: [suddenly appears all cleaned up] That's my name.
SpongeBob: Huh? [the mob gasps in shock] Ooh!
Patrick: At least, I think it's my name.
SpongeBob: [hugs Patrick] That wasn't you under all that muck?
Patrick: Uh, I don't think so. I went home and took a bath after I realized that I'd never be allowed in the Krusty Krab again.
SpongeBob: But if that was—then who was—?
Old Man Jenkins: [screams as he covers his eyes] Now I'm scared! I'm really scared! [whimpers] I can't take it!
SpongeBob: Hey I thought you said you had no sense of smell.
Old Man Jenkins: I don't, but I can see!
[Old Man Jenkins points to Patrick's buttocks being shown. The scene pulls out to reveal that Patrick is naked after he dropped his towel. Everyone except Squidward and Old Man Jenkins laugh at Patrick's nakedness. While everyone is enjoying their humorous occasion, the wind blows the remains of Filthy Muck. They morph together to bring Filthy Muck back to life. Filthy Muck waves good-bye down to SpongeBob and silently thanks him for the fun he had.]

Patrick tells SpongeBob he is going to his club meeting. SpongeBob is intrigued about this club, so Patrick tells him the club is the Empty Head Society. SpongeBob decides to join, so the two go inside one of the boxes and see the club in its entirety. The two give their brains at the door and soon afterwards, the Empty Heads have a meeting.Everyone goes to the meeting and the Ice Cream King is revealed to be the club president who started the meeting. He gets his secretary to read the minutes and then asks if there are any new recruits at the club. Patrick tells SpongeBob to go, as he wanted to join the club, so he goes up on the stage. The Ice Cream King checks to see if SpongeBob is dumb enough, and then tells everyone to pass a jar of saliva while SpongeBob drinks lemonade. However, SpongeBob thinks they are referring to the jar of saliva, and drinks that, causing everyone to get disgusted.The ice cream king announces that it is time to help the citizens of Bikini Bottom, the event being called the ""Nitwitting."" The Empty Heads sing a song about them being empty heads and then go out to do their civic duty. However, the Empty Heads end up hurting Bikini Bottom more than help them, making SpongeBob ask if what the Empty Heads are doing counts as civic duty. Patrick does not think about this comment very seriously, so SpongeBob continues the ""Nitwitting"" with the other Empty Heads.After SpongeBob makes a comment that the Ice Cream King finds to show that he is not dumb, he feels that he is not Empty Head material. SpongeBob eventually loses his last brain stem and becomes completely brainless. He starts to act goofy and do many awkward things, and soon ends up walking into a dark alley alone. Patrick finds SpongeBob in the alley and tells him he found his brain, though he just brought a bunch of brains inside a jar. SpongeBob finds his brain and eventually returns to his normal self. SpongeBob decides that he wants to fix the wreck the Empty Heads made, but it turns out everything was cleaned by Sandy and F.E.M.A., the club she is a part of. The episode ends with the Empty Heads crashing into SpongeBob and Sandy, singing the Empty Heads song once again, as the episode ends.",The Nitwitting,"[The episode begins at the Barg'N-Mart. Customers are minding their business doing their shopping.]
Barg'N-Mart P.A.: Attention, shoppers: We've got a SpongeBob on Aisle 6.
[SpongeBob comes out of Aisle 6 with Patrick on his head while riding his unicycle and scaring the customers. But SpongeBob couldn't see where he was going due to having a blindfold on his face.]
Patrick: Make a sharp left!
[SpongeBob and Patrick ride down the hallway where it leads to the locking dock. They bash through the door and crash land in a junkyard of boxes outside.]
Patrick: We're here!
SpongeBob: [takes off his blindfold and pulls himself together] I still don't understand why you had me wear a blindfold.
Patrick: Oh, um, I didn't want you to get anything in your eyes. [widens his eyes] See? [his eyeballs are covered in dead flies, hair and a string tangled on his left; he pulls the string out, which grosses SpongeBob out a little; Patrick and SpongeBob then walk over to a box with a picture of a door drawn on it] Okay, thanks, buddy. I'm going to my club meeting now.
SpongeBob: What's your club, hmm? [giggles]
Patrick: Uh, it's the Empty Head Society. Eh, it's a place where guys like me can give their [reads card] ""powerful intellects"" a much-needed rest.
SpongeBob: Whoa! I'd love to rest my intellect. Can I join?
Patrick: Sure! Anyone can join. It's exclusive. [SpongeBob giggles and attempts to go into the box by pushing it, but nothing happens] Oh, that's not how you open it. [pulls out a stick and draws a square in the sand] You have to step on the automatic doormat. [SpongeBob steps in the dirt square] Ding! [Patrick lifts the box up and they both climb inside]
[Inside the box, there is a bunch of people, who appear as club members, acting in a goofy and idiotic manner similar to Patrick. One is eating a hot dog while being hung on a pole. The other is dancing on a blobfish member's fez. Two fish are playing with a lighting upside-down on the box's ceiling. One is dancing to the music with a chicken on the record player.]
SpongeBob: Wow. They do seem blissfully brainless. [prepares to walk over and join]
Patrick: Oh, oh, hold it! [grabs SpongeBob] You have to check your smart thingy at the door.
[Howard Blandy is in line at the check-in station, texting on his phone. He checks in by opening his head and give his brain to a lobster club member, who then gives him a fez. SpongeBob gets his turn. He reaches into his head and pulls out his brain, leaving his brain stems sparking. He gives his brain to the lobster club member, who also gives him a fez. Patrick gets his turn as well. He pulls out his eye and pushes out his brain, which is quite tiny compared to the others. The lobster club member gives Patrick a fez. One club member approaches SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Sheldon: Hello, numbskull.
Patrick: Hiya, dodo!
Sheldon: Shall we do the Empty Head handshake?
Patrick: Okay!
[Patrick and club member dig into each other's mouths and give their handshakes with their tongues. One club member looks at the clock drawing next to him. He lifts a cinderblock and crushes his feet with it, screaming his head off in pain.]
SpongeBob: [gets startled by the screaming and hops in Patrick's arms] What was that?
Patrick: The signal for the meeting to start. Come on.
[All of the club members rush over to the stage, nearly knocking over SpongeBob and Patrick. Patrick trips on a pail and begins rolling around. The pail bumps into a fallen member and sends them flying over to pile of pails in front of the stage. The club members then pounce on both SpongeBob and Patrick. One member removes the chicken from the record player and replaces it with a ham. The club president, the Ice Cream King, walks up to the stage, but trips over his own feet. He taps on a roll of toilet paper as if he's tapping a microphone.]
Ice Cream King: Good, I see everyone's in their assigned places. The secretary will now read the minutes. [lifts his belly and pulls out his secretary]
Little idiot: [reads off the back of the Kelpo cereal box] These are the minutes. One minute, twelve minutes, wait a minute, give me a minute.
Ice Cream King: Hike! [kicks his secretary off the stage] Are there any new initiates here tonight?
Patrick: [whispers] SpongeBob, go up. You always wanted to join the club. [launches SpongeBob up to the stage by bashing his fist on one club member's buttocks]
Ice Cream King: [looks suspiciously at SpongeBob as he giggled nervously] Hmm, are you sure you're, uh, brainless enough? [SpongeBob looks around and kicks the plank below him, which hits him in the face] Perfect! You've earned your first badge. [gives him a bacon strip as a badge; SpongeBob giggles weakly and gives Patrick a thumb's up] It's time to pass the jar.
SpongeBob: Hmm?
[One club member opens an empty jar and drools saliva into it. She passes it to a blobfish club member and he wrings saliva from his tongue into the jar. He passes the jar to an eel club member and he turns his fez like a faucet and pours saliva into the jar. He passes the jar over to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Hmm? Uh... [spits a drop of his saliva into the jar]
Empty Head Society club members: Drink! Drink! Drink!
[SpongeBob groans in disgust and tries to hesitate in drinking the jar full of saliva.]
Empty Head Society club members: Drink! Drink! Drink!
[SpongeBob gives in and drinks all of the saliva from the jar. He gags himself as he tries not to throw up and burps out a saliva bubble from his mouth.]
Empty Head Society club members: [shocked and grossed out] Ugh!
SpongeBob: What? You said drink!
Ice Cream King: [taps SpongeBob's shoulder] Ahem. [points to the lemonade stand next to him] Lemonade?
SpongeBob: Huh?
Ice Cream King: [takes the empty jar and puts it on the shelf where he keeps the other jars of saliva] We just save and date the drool. But that was so dopey you earned another badge! [pulls out used chewing gum from his mouth and puts it with SpongeBob's bacon badge] There! It's now time to go out in the community and help the citizens... [flings his toilet paper microphone at an unseen character, screaming ""ow!""] of Bikini Bottom by doing our civic duty. Whatever that means.
SpongeBob: Uh, we're gonna do some civic duty?
Patrick: We call it the ""Nitwitting."" [jumps on the stage and joins in the Ice Cream King and the entire club to sing their oath]
Patrick, Ice Cream King, and the Empty Head Society club members: ♪We're all unfit. We must admit we're dumb as a box of rocks. [two club members bash each other's heads] But time permitting, we'll be nitwitting. Has anyone seen my socks?♪
Ice Cream King: To the mini boats!
Two Empty Head Society club members: To the mini boats!
[SpongeBob, Patrick, the Ice Cream King, and the Empty Head Society club members exit their clubhouse box and begin riding in mini boats.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, why are we doing this, again?
Patrick: I have no idea. [honks the horn]
[SpongeBob, Patrick, the Ice Cream King, and the Empty Head Society club members ride down the road in their mini boats. The townspeople scream and run away in fear. Lou hops onto his hot dog stand and rides away in it like a horse. An old lady hides into her house and zips her door shut just as the Empty Head Society ride pass. The scene changes to the bowling alley. A bowler goes to make a strike with his bowling ball.]
Incidental EHS3: Hey, mister. You dropped your ball. [swings his hockey stick and hits the ball like a puck, crashing it into the bowler's face]
[The two Empty Head Society club members create havoc in the bowling ally by flinging bowling balls at the bowlers. The scene cuts to Larry doing his workout on the treadmill at his gym.]
Incidental EHS9: Keep running. I'll pace you.
[Larry tries to run away, but the treadmill was moving too fast. He then gets crushed by the blobfish club member's mini boat. The scene changes to one of the club members painting happy faces on the traffic light.]
Incidental EHS6: These lights could use a smile.
[This action causes a major pile-up in the middle of the intersection and all the drivers complain. One Empty Head Society club member plows through the sidewalk with a lawnmower. The scene changes to Patrick breaking parking meters with a baseball bat. SpongeBob follows by putting bowls on the broken parking meters and pour soup in them.]
SpongeBob: I have a feeling you guys are a little confused about what civic duty is.
Patrick: [babbles while breaking off the parking meters] Uh, I don't think so! ""Civic duty is using your patootie."" [laughs and breaks the parking meter with his buttocks] No confusion there!
[A passing driver parks his boat and throws a quarter into the bowl of soup. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick looking at a garbage can.]
Patrick: Why would people throw their stinky garbage in these beautiful cans? [puts the garbage can on his head]
SpongeBob: Maybe their pockets were already full.
Ice Cream King: [rolls over to SpongeBob and Patrick in his own garbage can] ""Pockets full?"" I can clearly see you're not as brainless as us.
SpongeBob: [sadly] Aww…
Patrick: I can't see anything!
SpongeBob: [sighs] Oh well. [takes off his fez] I guess I'm just not Empty Head material. Well, bye, buddy. [places the fez on Patrick's garbage can and leaves]
Patrick: [lifts his garbage can up] My name's ""Buddy"" now?
[Patrick and the Ice Cream King then bash and hit each other with their garbage cans.]
Both: Buddy! Buddy! Buddy!
SpongeBob: [his head short-circuits while walking] Well, that's funny. I seem to be lost. Oh, I'll figure it out. I still got so life in the ol' brain stem.
[SpongeBob attempts to keep his brain stem alive by sprinkling water with his watering can. But since his brain's been out of his head for too long, they short-circuit and shrivel. All of a sudden, SpongeBob's head and face begin to deform and makes himself appear to be just as brainless as Patrick, the Ice Cream King, and the club members of the Empty Head Society.]
SpongeBob: [starts to sound goofy] What's a brain stem? I know! I'll just walk backwards and that should get me back to the beginning of the day. [walks backwards while talking backwards; he bumps into a ""No Parking"" sign] I'm even more lost-er than I was before-er. [gasps as he sees a lady at the bus stop] Oh, I will direct asking— [grunts in frustration] Ask directions. [barks like a seal, hops over to the lady in a goofy fashion and spins his body in front of her] Excuse me, large lady. I'm a widdle girl who's misplaced herself. Can you help find me? [lisping] I'm pretty. [gets hit in the face by the lady's purse] Ow!
Incidental 48: Weirdo! [screams as she runs away]
SpongeBob: Well, that didn't come out right. [whines]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob walking alone in a dark alley. He finds an old chair and goes to sit on it. But each time he tries to do so, he ends up doing it wrong. He gives up and sulks in a puddle on the ground.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I've forgotten how to sit!
Incidental 23: [chuckles] Obviously not the sharpest tool in the—the tool thing. [chuckles]
[SpongeBob mopes on the ground, helplessly. Just then, he sees something step out from the darkness. It was Patrick, holding a jar of brains.]
Patrick: Oh, there you are! You forgot your thinking thingy. I wasn't sure which one was yours, buddy.
SpongeBob: Uh, now my name's ""Buddy?""
Patrick: No, duh. That's my name! I think.
SpongeBob: [takes Patrick's small brain and goes to stuff it in his head, but it falls out] No, not mine. [takes another one, but it slides out too] Wrong brain. [takes another one, but it slides out too] Oh, bad brain. Oh, I guess I'll take this stupid one. [takes a square-shaped brain and stuffs it in his head]
Patrick: [looks carefully at SpongeBob] Hmm...Hmm... [shakes SpongeBob's body for a bit] Try saying, ""I'm ready.""
SpongeBob: Slime ready! Uh, dime Betty! [Patrick wrings up SpongeBob like a wheel] Spaghetti! I'm sweaty! I'm all wetty! [Patrick grabs SpongeBob, stretches him and straightens him out as best as he could] I'm ready. [gasps as he is back to his normal self] I'm ready! I'm ready! High-five!
Patrick: Yeah! [gives SpongeBob a high-five, but makes his spiral around and around]
SpongeBob: [babbles in dizziness and laughs] Patrick, I know you and the Empty Head Society mean well, but man, we sure messed up a lot of things in town today. So, I'm gonna reverse all the damage that we did during the Nitwitting! [leaves]
Patrick: Hey, you'd better hurry because you're getting smaller! What a guy. Hmm? [knocks over the old chair and climbs into it with his head peaking out from the hole] Nothing like a good sit in a chair. [sighs]
[SpongeBob walks out into the street and goes to clean up the mess the Empty Head Society club members made. But much to his surprise, everything appears to be cleaned up and things are back to normal.]
SpongeBob: Oh, that's weird. Everything's already back to normal. What? [looks down and sees the sidewalk repaved; he walks around and sees the parking meters repaired; he then notices one part of the city that hasn't been cleaned] Hmm. Well, it's still a mess over here. [he backs up and bumps into a full trash can; he then meets up with his friend, Sandy, who has been cleaning up the mess all along] Sandy? You cleaned everything up?
Sandy: Of course, SpongeBob. I belong to a club called F.E.M.A. [holds up her membership card] That stands for ""Fix the Emptyhead's Mess Again."" Our civic duty is repairing the mayhem that the Empty Heads cause every month. You got some gunk on your tie.
SpongeBob: Yeah, they're badges. [eats the badge the Ice Cream King gave him]
Sandy: Hey,  SpongeBob. How would you like to join F.E.M.A.?
SpongeBob: No thanks. After giving my brain a vacation, I need a rest.
[Suddenly, SpongeBob and Sandy hear something.]
Both: Huh?
Sandy: Uh-oh! Speaking of ""brain vacation."" [grabs SpongeBob and hops into the trash can to hide from the Empty Head Society club members as they ride by]
[Patrick is among the group and honks his horn. The Empty Head Society club members cause a pile-up in the middle of the intersection and they all sing their oath.]

SpongeBob and Patrick see him, and they want to come with him on his trip. However, Patrick grabs the ramp from the RV, causing it to roll down the road and get crushed by a giant anchor and then explode.Squidward is upset that he cannot see the water lily and goes home. SpongeBob and Patrick feel bad for him, so they turn SpongeBob's house into an RV. Squidward has a dream about seeing two water lilies with SpongeBob and Patrick's faces as the flower. Squidward wakes up to realize he is in SpongeBob's RV and that they are on the road.They eventually reach Porpoise Peak and Squidward comes out to see the warbling water lily. As a big crowd of people also come to see the water lily, Patrick digs the plant out and gives it to Squidward. The flower rots because of this, and the crowd pummels Squidward, seeing him as the cause of the flower's rot.Squidward gets the idea to take the RV and leave SpongeBob and Patrick behind at Porpoise Peak, just to get rid of them. However, he gets worried about them as he is driving, and heads back to see if they are alright. Squidward hears screams from a cave, and he attacks a sea bear, as he thinks it is hurting SpongeBob and Patrick.It turns out the sea bears were friendly to the two, but they maul Squidward for hitting one of them. The three head back home, and SpongeBob gives Squidward the water lily. Overjoyed, Squidward plays the clarinet, which makes SpongeBob and Patrick run away, as the episode ends.",Pineapple RV,"[The episode begins with a morning at Conch Street. Squidward is coming out of his house with a bunch of stuff.]
Squidward: [sighs] One glorious week [pulls out his keys] without those two...
[Suddenly, SpongeBob and Patrick appear under the RV.]
SpongeBob: Hey!
[Squidward steps on SpongeBob and Patrick and twirls until he, SpongeBob, and Patrick fly into the air.]
Squidward: [yelling] ...Idiots!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hi, Squidward!
[SpongeBob and Patrick land safely on the ground, but Squidward injures himself and his stuff falls on him. SpongeBob walks towards Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Hold on, Squidward! [SpongeBob pulls Squidward out by grabbing his head. Eventually, SpongeBob manages to get Squidward, then SpongeBob gets tangled on Squidward's tentacles. Patrick walks to SpongeBob and Squidward as he pulls one of Squidward's tentacles to get SpongeBob out.] You should be more careful.
Patrick: Tisk, tisk, tisk!
Squidward: Would you two go away and stop ruining my vacation?!
SpongeBob: Vacation? Gee, I didn't think Mr. Krabs gave us any vacations.
[Squidward pushes SpongeBob and Patrick away from him.]
Squidward: I found someone to cover for me.
[We cut to the inside of the Krusty Krab where Old Man Walker is at register boat for taking Squidward's side.]
Old Man Walker: One Krabby Patty coming up, sir.
[Old Man Walker tries to work the cash register. He presses the button that opens and sends himself straight through the window to the kitchen. Cut back at Conch Street where Squidward is putting his case and sack on the top of his RV.]
SpongeBob: Where are you going on your vacation, Squidward?
Squidward: If you must know, I'm going to Porpoise Peak to bask in the melodious sounds of the Warbling Water Lily. [A cloud appears and shows the Warbling Water Lily. Imagination SpongeBob and Patrick appear and whiteness the Warbling Water Lily. A clock appears in the sky and the big hand points at the 500.] Which only blooms once every five hundred years. [The cloud pops and Imagination SpongeBob and Patrick come out small. Squidward grabs them.] And I'm going alone. [He smacks the mini SpongeBob and Patrick together and the mini Patrick runs up to SpongeBob and Patrick as Patrick puts the mini Patrick in his pocket.]
SpongeBob: I know! [quickly runs back with a different outfit and a case] Patrick and I will come along, and we can all be alone together.
Squidward: Oh no, you're not messing up my vacation. [picks up SpongeBob's case and slams it on him] Now beat it! If I don't get moving, I'm gonna miss it. [walks to get himself packed and ready]
SpongeBob: [pops out of the case with Squidward's shirt on] Oh, we'll help you pack.
Squidward: No way, you idiots will just break... [But SpongeBob and Patrick didn't break anything. They got Squidward's stuff packed.] ...everything? [impressed] Oh.
Patrick: Hold it! [steps off the RV and falls] We forgot to pack this. [points at the ramp]
[Patrick uses his mouth to pull the ramp off of the RV. SpongeBob hops off the RV and helps Patrick to pull the ramp off. They both pull it off until it hits Patrick's face. Patrick then laughs.]
Squidward: What? No, don't! Stop!
[Suddenly, the RV drives off. Squidward screams in terror as he watches his RV drive off in the distance. He runs off after it and pushes SpongeBob and Patrick over. Squidward then stops and watches the RV drive off. SpongeBob and Patrick shows up and watch it too. The RV drives off through traffic, then it hits a sign that reads ""Bridge Out."" The RV then drives through two rings of fire and passes by an octopus' arm. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward worry that the RV would crash until it finally stops.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Phew.
[But as soon as they are relieved that the RV stopped, an anchor smashes the RV, causing it to explode. Squidward becomes utter shocked that his RV is destroyed thanks to SpongeBob and Patrick. Now he can't see the warbling water lily.]
Patrick: You could buff that out.
[Squidward gets angry and ink splatters out of his head.]
Squidward: [to Patrick] How could?!... [to SpongeBob] Why would?!... [stutters] I can't believe it! [Squidward has angered out words until he turns sad. A tire is on fire and starts wheeling towards SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward.] I'll never see the warbling water-lily bloom now.
[Squidward then walks to his house and bangs his head on the door to open it. Squidward then enters his house all sad and closes his door, now that his chances of seeing the warbling water lily are shattered. SpongeBob and Patrick feel ashamed of themselves of what they have done: They ruined Squidward's hopes of seeing the warbling water lily. SpongeBob and Patrick begin to feel bad for Squidward as he walks to his house.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh. Poor Squidward.
SpongeBob: [gets an idea] Oh! I have an idea.
Patrick: Really? What's that like?
[Inside Squidward's bedroom, Squidward is getting ready for bed. He is still angry at SpongeBob and Patrick for ruining his hopes on seeing the warbling water lily.]
Squidward: Little monsters. They oughta be locked up. Throw away the key and then... [snores] Locked up and throw them away. [Squidward dreams that he is at Porpoise Peak seeing the warbling water lily. Squidward drives his RV, then sings and dances to two warbling water lilies. He smells them until the warbling water lilies open and reveals to be SpongeBob and Patrick. They start laughing, a purple shadow background shows. Squidward wakes up from his sleep and screams in horror. He is now in SpongeBob's house.] Oh, oh, phew. It was only a nightmare. [The camera zooms out revealing SpongeBob and Patrick. Squidward looks at SpongeBob and screams, he then looks at Patrick then screams as well. SpongeBob and Patrick both scream as Squidward screams. Squidward grabs their mouths.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward.
Squidward: [pulls them over] Would you get out of my bedroom?!
SpongeBob: [laughs] We're not in your bedroom, silly.
[Squidward notices his bed is in SpongeBob's living room. He quickly jumps off of his bed.]
Squidward: What? How did I get here?
SpongeBob: Patrick and I mo-
Squidward: [covers SpongeBob's mouth] Actually, I don't care. [leaves to get out of SpongeBob's house] Goodbye, SpongeB- [Just as Squidward was about to leave, he falls out of SpongeBob's door, which his house is now an RV. Squidward quickly gets back inside SpongeBob's house, he then notices two-passenger seats and a steering wheel. Squidward notices SpongeBob's house is an RV.] SpongeBob, why is your house... [screaming] driving on the road?!
Patrick: Because we turned it into a RV!
SpongeBob: We didn't want you to miss that flower blooming.
Squidward: Okay. Hold on. Who's driving?
Patrick: It's on autosnail.
[Gary is shown driving and is being distracted by his toy.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Come on, let's get breakfast. [takes Squidward's hand]
[Bubble transition to the kitchen where Patrick and Squidward are sitting. Patrick is laughing while he has a knife and fork in his hand. SpongeBob tosses three coffee mugs, three plates, and coffee on the table. He then walks to the table with two stacks of pancakes. Squidward smells them.]
Squidward: Hey, this looks pretty good.
[All of a sudden, unbeknownst to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward, the RV drives over a wobbly damaged bridge. Squidward is about to eat his pancakes, but the plates slide off due to the RV on the bridge. Squidward tries to eat his pancakes again but misses again. The RV wobbles onto the bridge. Finally, Squidward reaches his pancakes with his fork. Squidward is about to eat his pancakes, but the RV drives into a bump on the bridge. Squidward accidentally eats all the pancakes at once and chokes on them. He then spits the pancakes out in front of Patrick.]
Patrick: [points at the pancakes] Are you gonna eat that?
[The RV is off the bridge, which causes it to break. Gary is shown tired from driving so much.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, let's give Gary a break.
Patrick: Disengaging autosnail! [presses a button to give the toy to Gary]
[Gary starts chewing on his toy while Patrick takes his place.]
Gary: [chewing on his toy] Meow, meow, meow, meow.
Patrick: Let's see what this pineapple can do! [Patrick presses on the brakes and drives faster, which it follows him running over a ""Road Closed"" sign and drives to the mountain. Squidward notices how high they are and sees a bunch of boats all damaged.] On the road!
Squidward: [gulps] We gotta get off this road!
Patrick: No problem.
[Patrick then press a button which activates rocket boosters from the back of the RV. He drives off very fast on five roads. Patrick is driving so fast it sends Squidward off his seat and slams on the wall. He then notices SpongeBob next to him.]
SpongeBob: Oh! Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: [screams] I'm not here! This isn't happening!
[Suddenly, the RV drives on the steepest hill and up a ramp. It then flies in mid-air. Inside the RV, Squidward floating in mid-air as the RV is flying. Squidward grabs onto a door and accidentally opens it. A bunch of SpongeBob's stuff comes out of his door. Squidward misses it, but gets hit by a safe. SpongeBob is watching TV, which is floating along with his couch and chair. Gary is still chewing on his toy while floating as well. Patrick begins to float too. The RV lands on the road which they arrive at Porpoise Peak. Squidward hits through the sign. SpongeBob exits out of his house.]
SpongeBob: [laughs cheerfully] We're here!
Squidward: [shakes his head] Huh? [Squidward gasps as he sees the warbling water lily.] The warbling water lily! [pulls out his camera and runs towards the flower] Oh, so beautiful! And I have it all to my... [Suddenly, a group of people show up to see the flower and start taking pictures.] Ow! My back! [Squidward moves a few people out of his way, so he can take a picture of the flower, but it suddenly disappears.] Huh? Where is it?
[Patrick comes up with the warbling water lily.]
Patrick: Is this that babbling buttercup you were looking for?
[Patrick gives Squidward the flower as everyone looks in surprise. The flower then sprouts out, a light glows right before Squidward's eyes and starts playing music. But all of a sudden, the flower starts to dry out. Everyone gasps in complete shocked. Squidward is shocked to see that the flower as dried out as well. Everyone gets angry at Squidward and starts attacking him. SpongeBob walks towards the flower and notices how dry out it is. The fishes take Squidward and bury him into the ground and leave. Monroe comes up with a watering can and waters Squidward out of the ground like a flower. SpongeBob and Patrick come up to Squidward and SpongeBob smell his head. Squidward comes out and gets rid of the dirt.]
Squidward: Well, that's one more vacation down the drain. May as well go home.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Well, we got a long drive ahead of us. [pulls toilet paper out of his pore] We better go before go if you know what I mean-o.
Patrick: [laughs] Not really.
SpongeBob: Now, Squidward, don't leave without us. [laughs and leaves]
Squidward: [gets an idea] Huh? Of course not! Only a monster would leave you behind. [Squidward grins evilly and eventually, he leaves them behind, driving the RV.] So I'm a monster. [whistles] They'll be fine. Alone. [begins to sweat] On top of a mountain. In the middle of nowhere. [But Squidward stops the RV, realizing that he can't leave SpongeBob and Patrick behind.] D'oh, I can't do it!
[Squidward reverses back to get SpongeBob and Patrick. We cut back to the woods where SpongeBob and Patrick are finished using the bathroom. Patrick has toilet paper all over him.]
SpongeBob: Hey, you're really getting the hang of using toilet paper, Patrick.
Patrick: And next week, I'm starting on two-ply.
SpongeBob: I'll get another roll from the RV. [SpongeBob walks towards to the RV, but to find that it's gone, due to Squidward leaving them behind.] Hey, where is the RV?
Patrick: [points] Well, maybe those guys have seen it. Hey, hey! Have you seen our pineapple?
[A group of sea bears, like the ones from ""The Camping Episode,"" show up and growl at Patrick. We cut back to Squidward still driving the RV to get SpongeBob and Patrick. He then parks the RV and looks for SpongeBob and Patrick. All of a sudden, SpongeBob and Patrick’s screams are heard.]
Squidward: Oh no, I'm too late! [Squidward runs to a cave and karate chops one of the sea bears.] Don't you dare eat those morons!
[But instead of hearing screaming, SpongeBob and Patrick were laughing and tickling the sea bears.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, they weren't eating us.
Patrick: We were just having a tickle fight. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Sea bears love it when you tickle their bellies.
Patrick: [laughs] But they hate it when you karate chop their hineys.
Squidward: [realizing what he has done while the sea bears growl at him] Uh, tickle, tickle?
[The sea bears begin to attack and maul Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, they'll leave you alone if you play dead!
Patrick: [pulls out a tombstone that says ""RIP Squidward"" and throws it at Squidward] This will help! Catch!
[The tombstone hits Squidward's head while he is being mauled to death. The sea bears stop mauling Squidward and leaves.]
SpongeBob: Bye. Call me. You got my number. [Bubble transition to Conch Street where the RV bumps into Squidward's house and parks. SpongeBob kicks open the door.] Wow! Was that a fun road trip or was that a fun road trip? [Patrick comes out of the RV and spins in the air of excitement.]
Patrick: The funnerest!
[Squidward walks up out of the RV with bandages on him after being attacked by sea bears.]
Squidward: More like the worst road trip. My one chance to hear the warbling water lily, and you ruined it! [falls out of the RV]
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Are you sure about that, Squidward? [pulls out the flower] Ohh, poor thing just needs some love. [pours water into the pot and kisses it]
Squidward: [gasps] The warbling water lily! [The warbling water lily begins to play.] So beautiful. [pulls out his clarinet and plays]
SpongeBob: Oh, my ears! My ears! It hurts! It hurts! [SpongeBob breaks apart and Patrick's head explodes and screams.] We're so happy for you, Squidward!
[They run back into the RV to escape from the racket.]
Patrick: Engage autosnail!

SpongeBob: [screams in pain] Ah! Yow! Oh, oh! Hot, hot, hot! [sprays hot mustard on his eyes, but it doesn't help; it hurts his eyes even more] Hot mustard! [his eyes melt; grabs a fire extinguisher and sprays it in his face] Oh! Oh! Whoa! [his eyes pop back out]
Squidward: You mind? Can't you see I'm trying to read here?
[SpongeBob notices a loose string on Squidward's shirt. He goes to pull it, but Squidward turns his head.]
Squidward: Hm? [growls]
[SpongeBob goes back to flipping patties and Squidward turns around. SpongeBob becomes distracted by the loose string and goes to pull it again.]
Squidward: What are you doing?!
SpongeBob: You have a loose thread.
Squidward: Hm? [sees the loose thread] So?
SpongeBob: [goes to reach the loose string, but Squidward slaps his hand away] I want to pull it.
Squidward: [sighs] If I let you pull it, will you please let me read my book in peace?!
SpongeBob: Mm-hm.
Squidward: Fine. Get it over with.
[SpongeBob giggles as his smile carves a circle around his face. His face falls off and he regenerates a new one. SpongeBob gleefully grabs the loose string and starts pulling it. As he pulls it, the string gets longer and longer. He climbs out through the window and unravels Squidward's shirt. Squidward growls in anger and the string cuts through his workstation and the cash register. SpongeBob goes to follow the loose string. Squidward looks down and sees himself naked. He grabs his boat and walks out in embarrassment. SpongeBob continues pulling the string and unravels the customers clothes, leaving them naked.]
Unknown incidental 7: [gasps] Nobody look down! [covers himself]
[The customers look down, see themselves naked, and scream.]
Fred: My leg... of my pants!
[The customers cover themselves and run out. SpongeBob looks up and sees everyone is gone, oblivious to the fact that he's naked too. He continues to pull the loose string until a new customer comes in.]
SpongeBob: Seat yourself, sir. I'll be with you in a minute.
[The customer immediately leaves after seeing SpongeBob naked. Mr. Krabs is in his office, kissing a dollar bill.]
Mr. Krabs: [kisses dollar] Me most valuable possession, [grabs a picture of his daughter, Pearl] except, of course, [opens the backside of the picture and pulls out a $100,000,000 bill] for you, my love. [sighs]
[SpongeBob comes in the office while still pulling the string. SpongeBob then unravels the dollar bill and begins decreasing the amount of the bill.]
Mr. Krabs: What the? [screams] Me appreciation is depreciating! [sees the string decreasing the bill to one dollar] Ah! No, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! [the president on the dollar bill runs away] One dollar?! [cries and wipes away the tears with the dollar]
Rich patron: [off-screen] I demand a refund!
Mr. Krabs: [runs out of his office] Uh, what's the problem here, sir?
Rich patron: There is a hair in my soup, and I demand a refund!
Mr. Krabs: [looks down and sees the loose string in the soup] Ooh. Uh, well, that's not just any hair, sir. It's from the elusive Peruvian jelly-lope, for flavor, and it's only an extra... [looks and sees his dollar in his back] $100 million charge? Hm?
Rich patron: That seems slightly exorbitant, but really, what's a measly $100 million to someone like me? [goes to take out a dollar from his wallet, but SpongeBob removes the string from the soup; he puts the dollar back in his wallet] Ah, just as well. I wasn't that hungry anyway.
[Mr. Krabs gasps in shock and explodes. He is now wearing tattered clothes and is completely poor. Mr. Krabs turns and leaves in depression. Meanwhile, SpongeBob comes out through the restaurant's front door and continues unraveling the loose string. He unravels the Krusty Krab sign and pulls the letters down. The letters that drop down spell ""Rusty Kab."" Just then, a taxi driver pulls up.]
Taxi driver: Someone order a rusty cab?
SpongeBob: I like string.
Taxi driver: Congratulations. [drives away]
[SpongeBob continues pulling the string and unravels the taxi driver's cab. The driver crashes into a building. SpongeBob continues following and pulling the loose string, stepping on the driver's face.]
Taxi driver: Ow!
[The scene changes to the Shirts Is Us store, where Squidward just bought himself a new shirt.]
Squidward: [comes out with a new purple shirt] Ah, there's nothing quite like a brand-new shirt. Whoops. Forgot the tag.
SpongeBob: [continues pulling the loose string] I got it! [unravels Squidward's bag and new shirt, leaving him naked again]
[SpongeBob continues following the loose string and Squidward growls. The string leads SpongeBob to Sandy's treedome, where SpongeBob pulls Sandy against the glass and unravels her tail.]
Sandy: [sees her tail gone] Huh? SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oops. Sorry, Sandy. [pulls the string and unravels the glass of Sandy's dome]
[Sandy begins swimming up to the surface for air. Bubble transition to the Sweat-rs store, where Squidward bought himself a sweater.]
Squidward: [comes out with a purple sweater] Ah, nothing beats cashmere. [starts sweating] Oh, a bit warm for a sweater today, though.
SpongeBob: [continues pulling the loose string] I can help!
Squidward: No, no, no, no! No, no, no-- [gets spun around by SpongeBob as he unravels his sweater; he looks down and sees himself naked again] Oh, come on!
[Bubble transition to the Bikini Bottom Zoo. Bubble Bass is teasing a pack of sea monkeys with a Krabby Patty. Bubble Bass eats the patty, then rubs his tummy and the monkey moans. SpongeBob comes by while pulling the loose string and unravels the cage bars, setting the monkeys free. The monkeys growl, pounce on Bubble Bass and start attacking him. Bubble transition to the Swords & Such store, where Squidward bought himself a suit of armor.]
Squidward: [comes out in a suit of armor, sing-songs a fanfare and opens his helmet] Let's see that twine-twirling twit try to unravel this! Huh. Huh? [his suit ironically gets unraveled by SpongeBob, leaving him naked again] Really? [his helmet closes on his nose] Ouch!
[Bubble transition to dusk over the outskirts of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob continues pulling the loose string and completely unravels all of Bikini Bottom, leaving nothing there. SpongeBob pulls the string and gets pulled up to the surface where a fisherman fished him out. SpongeBob pulls the loose string and completely unravels the fisherman until he's gone. The string leads him over to Bikini Atoll and SpongeBob unravels the island until it's gone. He pulls himself up into the sky and into outer space, where he completely unravels the Milky Way and the entire universe, leaving nothing more than a white dimension. Now, with everything completely gone, SpongeBob finally finds the end of the loose string. Just then, Patrick comes in.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, hi.
Patrick: [sees a loose string on SpongeBob's shirt] You have a thing on your thing.
[Patrick pulls the loose string on SpongeBob and unravels him into a string. Then he uses the string to floss his teeth like dental floss. SpongeBob giggles in the background, ending the episode.]",1.38,"Luke Brookshier,[1],Fred Osmond"

Her competitiveness annoys everyone, so SpongeBob and Patrick go to Jellyfish Fields. However, Sandy appears and wants to do jellyfishing as well, much to the dismay of the two. Sandy wants to play competitively (such as taking the jellyfish on her suit), but SpongeBob and Patrick tell her the sport is about catching and releasing the gentle creatures. However, Sandy gets bored of this and spices up the game by feeding the jellyfish Frankenstein fish food, growing them to be large and aggressive.While Sandy enjoys the more competitive style of this type of jellyfishing, SpongeBob and Patrick get extremely hurt by this. Sandy becomes so competitive about jellyfishing that she decides to catch them all, using a super suit. After doing this, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Larry state that there is no more jellyfish to catch and also a field since she ruined it with her rocket boots. She realizes that what she has done is wrong and that she needs to think about her actions.Sandy decides to start meditating to calm her mind. However, it turns out all the jellyfish had combined to form a jellyfish monster, and SpongeBob and Patrick had led it to the treedome. Because she has become non-violent, she tries to stop the monster using non-physical methods, but they do not work. Sandy eventually becomes more aggressive and starts fighting the monster physically. She tries several methods to defeat the monster and eventually does so by beating it up from the inside, causing it to explode into thousands of regular jellyfish. The episode ends with the three back at Jellyfish Fields, where Sandy starts acting less competitive towards jellyfishing, only to get angry at a jellyfish who stung her.",Squirrel Jelly,"[The episode begins on a beautiful, summer day at Goo Lagoon. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy are playing a basketball.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble— [both pause and stare at the ball]
Sandy: Hm?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [goes back to bouncing the ball] Dribble, dribble, [Patrick bounces the ball with his head] dribble, dribble, [then Patrick bounces the ball with his butt] dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble.
[Sandy groans impatiently and looks at her watch.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble.
[Patrick bounces the ball with his tongue.]
SpongeBob: Dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble.
[Sandy grows more impatient and scratches her helmet.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Patrick bounces the ball with his stomach] Dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble—
Sandy: It's been ten minutes! Ain't you gonna shoot?!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [long pause then resumes bouncing the ball] Dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, [Sandy runs over to a boat, chews some barnacles off and makes a ball of her own] dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble—
[Sandy runs over SpongeBob and Patrick and shoots the barnacle basketball in the net.]
Sandy: Sorry, but you boys were slower than a Sunday afternoon. [throws the barnacle basketball at Patrick; the scene changes to Sandy having SpongeBob and Patrick compete in a little hot dog contest] On your mark, get set, eat!
[SpongeBob and Patrick pick up their hot dogs, give each other a toast of friendship, and slowly begin chewing on them.]
Sandy: Wow, you two are off like a herd of turtles. Watch this! [eats a hot dog]
[Sandy hops over to a hot dog stand, kicks it, holds her breath, catches the hot dogs with her helmet, puts helmet back on, and eats all of the hot dogs.]
Sandy: [burps] I win. [pulls her flower off her helmet]
[Sandy's bad breath exits her helmet and forms into a big hot dog. The hot dog-shaped fumes of Sandy's breath float past SpongeBob and Patrick. They smell it and their heads shrink.]
Sandy: Hot dang! I'm faster than green grass through a goose! Hm, these jumbo dogs are much too big for your baby heads. [grabs the hot dogs and smooshes them into small hot dogs] These dinky dogs should do ya. [stuffs the dinky dogs in SpongeBob and Patrick's mouths]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [muffled] Thank you.
Sandy: You're welcome! [blows airhorn]
[The scene changes to Sandy warming up for volley ball. She makes a good serve with the ball and hits Larry, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs really hard.]
Sandy: [bounces on the net] I win again! [hops over to Larry, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs] That's right! [grabs them and squeezes them real tight] I own all of y'all! Yee-haw!
SpongeBob: Sandy, don't you think you're playing a teensy-weensy bit rough? Just a smidge? Hm?
Sandy: Aww, I'm actually going a little easy on you guys, seein' as you're all so delicate. [lets them go and takes out a bucket of chum] Hey, who wants to play ""dodge the chum?"" [throws some chum at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: No, I don't think I'm— [gets chum thrown in his face] Sandy is really stressing me out today. You want to go jellyfishing?
Patrick: [licks the chum off SpongeBob's face] No, I'd rather go jellyfishing.
SpongeBob: You sure you don't wanna go [takes out his jellyfishing net] jellyfishing?
Patrick: I said no. [takes out his net] I wanna go jellyfishing.
SpongeBob: [groans] Okay, we'll do what you want.
[SpongeBob and Patrick skip and laugh as they head to Jellyfish Fields. Sandy stands on a pile of beaten up pedestrians including Pearl, Squidward, Larry, and Mr. Krabs.]
Sandy: The name is Sandy Cheeks and I can lick any critter on any beach!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick happily chasing jellyfish in Jellyfish Fields.]
Patrick: Now this is fun!
SpongeBob: [mocks RP accent] Yes, quite the civilized sport, eh, what?
Patrick: [giggles, morphs into a horse and mocks RP accent] I say, No more rough-horsing. [laughs]
SpongeBob: [morphs into Sandy and talks in Southern accent] And no more you-know-who killing the casual vibe.
[Suddenly, Sandy pops out from the grass and startles SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Sandy: Hey, guys! [both SpongeBob and Patrick gibber in fear and Sandy takes out her net] Mind if I join you?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [weakly] Not at all.
Sandy: Great! I can't wait to kick some jelly booty! [snatches SpongeBob and Patrick in her net]
SpongeBob: Uh, the thing is, Sandy, in jellyfishing, we don't play to kick booty. We actually catch and release the little sea angels.
Sandy: Well, that sounds about as exciting as tap water soup. Oh, well. Your game, your rules. [lets them go]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick holding up their nets for the jellyfish to fly in. One jellyfish flies in SpongeBob's net and he laughs. Then it flies into Patrick's net.]
Patrick: [laughs] He's in mine now!
[The jellyfish flies back in SpongeBob's net.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Now he's in mine!
[The jellyfish flies back in Patrick's net and Patrick laughs. The jellyfish flies over to a bench where two other jellyfish are sitting on. It gives one jellyfish a high-five and lets it have a turn. The jellyfish flies into SpongeBob's net. Sandy is not too thrilled with this at all.]
Sandy: [flatly] Whoopee. [growls as she walks over and catches the jellyfish with her net] Whoo-hoo! [holds up a hunting plaque] You're gonna look good mounted on my wall!
SpongeBob: Uh-uh. Catch and release, Sandy.
[Sandy reluctantly lets the jellyfish go and it flies into SpongeBob's net. SpongeBob laughs and skips around with the jellyfish in his net.]
Sandy: Well, this is lamer than a paper sandwich.
[The scene changes to three jellyfish circling over tall grass. Sandy is hiding under the grass, spying on them.]
Sandy: Hey! [catches one jellyfish] Ooh! This one's fat as a tick! [catches the other two with her net] Ha, ha! Got you!
[SpongeBob and Patrick wander around in the grass and see no jellyfish at all.]
Patrick: Huh. The jelly-thingies were here a minute ago.
SpongeBob: It isn't let them to be so...coy.
[Sandy pops up from the grass and laughs. The jellyfish in her suit stings her from the inside.]
Sandy: [laughs] I guess they must've— [gets stung again] Gotten sick of the boring game! [gets stung again; she sees another jellyfish and follows it] Get in here, you slimy varmint!
[Patrick catches the jellyfish before Sandy could.]
Patrick: SpongeBob, look! How's it going, little guy?
Sandy: [growls] So that's how you wanna play it.
[Four jellyfish fly over Sandy and she lowers herself into the grass.]
Sandy: [pops out from the grass and opens her suit] Hi-ya! [catches the jellyfish with her suit] I'm catching and releasing—releasing from their freedom!
SpongeBob: [comes out from the grass and sees a jellyfish] Hey, widdle jewwy bewwy. Would you mind?
Sandy: [pops out from SpongeBob's body] Mine! [catches the jellyfish with her net, laughs, and blows her airhorn in SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: What? [sees one of his holes all flappy] Ugh.
Sandy: [jumps back into her suit] Yeah! [chuckles] Easier than slipping down a mudslide! [gets zapped by the jellyfish in her suit] Okay, okay! I know. Catch and release. [unzips her suit, releases the jellyfish, and zips it back] Isn't there anything more to this game?
SpongeBob: What more can anyone want?
Patrick: Yeah, it's perfect!
Sandy: I have an idea how we can [squeezes SpongeBob and Patrick really tight] kick things up a notch!
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, I really don't think we need to kick anything up any notches.
Sandy: [lets them go and holds up a can of Frankenstein fish food] Ha! Frankenstein Fish Food! Ooh, this should be fun! [holds up a gun and shoots the can of Frankenstein fish food in the air]
[The can explodes and releases green food in the shape of Frankenstein's head. The jellyfish fly over and eat the food. Suddenly, the food causes the jellyfish to buff up and become stronger. Then then extend razor-sharp blades.]
Sandy: Ha, ha! That's what I'm talking about! They're no longer jellyfish. Now they're jelly-buzz saws!
[The jelly-buzz saws fly down and begin attacking SpongeBob and Patrick. One of them flies into SpongeBob's net and flies away with SpongeBob. One slides Patrick's net in half with its blades.]
Patrick: Hey! You're supposed to fly into there!
[The jelly-buzz saws slice Patrick's head open and they fly into his head. They pops out his eyeballs and begin stinging him on the inside. Patrick now glows in a light-blue transparent.]
Patrick: [screams in agony] I'm a walking glow stick! [screams as the jelly-buzz saws chase after him]
SpongeBob: Whoa, Nelly, little jelly! [trips over a rock and flips around and around before crashing into a cactus] Ow. [now covered in prickles] Such a soothing pastime.
[Just then, A shadow lurks into SpongeBob, which reveals Sandy, who is now in a superhero suit, flies over SpongeBob with her rocket boots. One jellyfish is pulling Patrick by the trousers. Patrick is screaming in fear before Sandy scares them off of him. She takes out a box and activates a little cage.]
Patrick: Thank you, Super Sandy! [the cage expands and sends Patrick flying]
Sandy: Welcome to the jellyfish rodeo! [pushes button on her glove and catches a jelly-buzz saw with her net] Aha! [spins it around] Gotcha, varmint!
[SpongeBob and Patrick scream in horror as they watch Sandy torturing the jellyfish in front of them. Sandy tosses the jelly-buzz saw in her cage.]
SpongeBob: Hey, that is not how we do it! [gets stung and beaten up by the jelly-buzz saw] Carry on.
Sandy: Hands off that jellyfish, SpongeBob! He's mine! Oh, you are so mine!
SpongeBob: [gets strangled and beaten up by the jelly-buzz saw] No...problem. [the jelly-buzz saw lets go of him] Oy.
[The jelly-buzz saw flies away and Sandy zooms past SpongeBob and Patrick. Sandy catches up to the jelly-buzz saw and catches it with a catcher's mitt.]
Sandy: You're out! [takes the jelly-buzz saw and throws it into her cage] Hit the showers! Hm? [jellyfish fly over her] Time for spring cleaning! [activates the vacuum on her suit and sucks up most of the jellyfish; she then drops them into the cage from her suit] Into the dustbin of history!
[Just then, numerous of angry jellyfish loom over Sandy. She lays two black marks on her helmet and gives out a warcry. She then starts flying around and catch jellyfish with her net, without showing signs of any mercy. SpongeBob and Patrick watch in fear and get zapped by the incoming jellyfish. Sandy zooms past them and carelessly begins destroying Jellyfish Fields with her rocket boots. She continues to catch almost all of the jellyfish in the fit of insanity and completely sets all of Jellyfish Fields on fire. She stuffs all of the jellyfish in her cage.]
Sandy: Whammer, bammer, in the slammer! Whoo-hoo! I'm the queen of Jellyfish Fields! How does that feel, losers? [crazily blows her airhorn]
[SpongeBob and Patrick are completely charred from Sandy's reckless competing.]
Patrick: [hoarsely] I don't like it. [his head is lit on fire and his face disintegrates a bit]
SpongeBob: I can't see or hear you, for my face has been cauterized. [his arms disintegrates]
Sandy: Ah, you guys are just out of shape. Come on, [knocks over Patrick] best two out of three.
SpongeBob: [opens his right eye] But you've got all the jellyfish.
Patrick: And there's no more field.
Sandy: [gasps] Oh? [turns around and sees the destructive mess she made all over Jellyfish Fields; she giggles sheepishly] Did I do that?
SpongeBob: [his body crumbles] Yes.
Patrick: [turns and sees his buttocks burned] You did this, too.
Sandy: I guess I can be overly competitive at times.
Larry: [comes by on crutches and in bandages] Gee, you think?! Ow! Ow! Gah! [leaves]
Sandy: You guys'll be all right. [picks SpongeBob up and turns him and Patrick around] if you just walk it off.
[SpongeBob and Patrick pick up their nets and begin to walk home, feeling devastated that their peaceful day of jellyfishing has been ruined.]
SpongeBob: Don't forget to release 'em.
Sandy: Oh? Hm? [gasps when she sees her cage open and the jellyfish gone] Yeah! That problem is solved. Now to my other problem. [begins flying away home, starting to feel remorseful about ruining SpongeBob and Patrick's day with her competitive side] Ah, I've got some deep-dish thinking to do about my aggressive ways.
[But just as Sandy leaves the destroyed Jellyfish Fields, the angry jellyfish she captured in her cage form into one giant angry jellyfish monster. The scene changes to Sandy's treedome, where Sandy did some redecorating and begins meditating in order to calm her aggressiveness. Her treedome has a flowing river, a stone pagoda, two bridges, some new trees, a windchime, a birdhouse, and a gong.]
Sandy: [meditating] Om. Om. Om. [grabs a rake with her foot and forms a yin-yang sign in the soil; then she grabs the gong and rings it] Om. [plays a panflute, makes a rainbow, and rings the gong] Om. Turns out, I'm the best at relaxing, too. [blows her airhorn]
Airhorn: Om.
[Meanwhile, outside Sandy's treedome, SpongeBob and Patrick are running and screaming their heads off. They run over to the front door of Sandy's treedome and frantically knock on it.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh, Sandy, help! It's horrible! [screaming and yelling while knocking on the door]
[They turn around and see the giant angry jellyfish monster flying over to them. SpongeBob and Patrick scream.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh, Sandy, help! It's— [enter through the front door, closes it, and scream] Oh.
[Both SpongeBob and Patrick look in awe as they see Sandy's treedome redecorated. The giant jellyfish monster roars and bangs outside the treedome. SpongeBob and Patrick cower in fear.]
Sandy: Ah, brother SpongeBob. Brother Patrick. I bow to your good natures. What can I do for you?
SpongeBob: You can clobber that giant jellyfish monster thing!
[The giant jellyfish monster bangs hard on the treedome, making a crack.]
Patrick: Yeah, smash it up good!
Sandy: Oh, I couldn't do that. I'm non-violent now. [gently pets a butterfly on her finger] I wouldn't hurt a fly-fish.
[The giant jellyfish monster lifts the treedome up and fills it with water. SpongeBob saves Sandy's life by putting his helmet onto her. The giant jellyfish monster enters the treedome begins zapping SpongeBob and Patrick with its stingers. Then it looms over to Sandy and prepares to attack her.]
Sandy: How about some soothing music, jellyfish? [begins playing a flute, but gets zapped by the giant jellyfish monster; she grabs some sand and forms it into a sitar] A soothing sitar always brings me peace.
[Sandy begins playing music on her sand sitar. The giant jellyfish monster starts to calm down and it seems to be working at first. But it wasn't powerful enough to soothe the savage beast. The giant jellyfish monster crushes Sandy with its fist, stretches her up, zaps her and plays rock music on her like a rock star. Then it throws her next to SpongeBob and Patrick, who are hiding behind her tree. SpongeBob picks Sandy up and straightens her out.]
Sandy: [groans and pulls herself together] The gongs! They always calm me down.
[The giant jellyfish monster continues zapping everything all over the place. SpongeBob and Patrick run over to the gongs and ring them really hard.]
Sandy: [meditating] Om.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [joins in meditating] Om.
[The giant jellyfish monster holds its ears shut in anger, buffs up and roars. It grabs the gongs and slams them into SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy. Sandy's attempts to calm the giant jellyfish monster are now in vain. The savage beast destroys nearly everything in her treedome and crushes SpongeBob and Patrick with its fists. Sandy, realizing that SpongeBob and Patrick are literally in danger, gets really mad.]
Sandy: [growls] Okay, that does it. I was a pacifist, but now I'm gonna pass my fist through your face! [floats up above her tree] As destroyer and transformer, I transform to destroy you. [begins to glow in a bright light while meditating]
[The giant jellyfish monster takes out six machetes and growls.]
Sandy: Put up your dukes and fight me like a squirrel!
[The giant jellyfish monster throws the machetes down to the ground. SpongeBob and Patrick frantically dodge the incoming machetes to avoid getting hurt. Sandy and the giant jellyfish monster throw punches and kicks at each other. But the beast was much more stronger and powerful than Sandy can imagine. The monster punches Sandy and sends her flying into the glass of her treedome.]
SpongeBob: Sandy, catch! [throws a bag up to Sandy]
Sandy: [catches the bag] The universe gave us a terrible weapon made up of the darkest dark matter just for this occasion. [takes out a bucket of chum] Ever played ""dodge the chum?""
[The chum bubbles. The giant jellyfish gasps, grabs both SpongeBob and Patrick and zaps them.]
Sandy: Hey, get your slimy mitts off my pals! [starts throwing chum at the giant jellyfish monster] Hiya! Ya!
[The giant jellyfish monster retaliates by using SpongeBob and Patrick as shields. SpongeBob and Patrick get splattered by chum. Patrick eats the chum from his face. The giant jellyfish monster roars and blows a raspberry at Sandy.]
Sandy: [dodges the giant jellyfish monster's electricity] Whoa! [growls] Hiya! [throws more blobs of chum at the giant jellyfish monster, but it sucks up the chum] Nothing! That's it! [flies into the giant jellyfish monster's body]
[The giant jellyfish monster, thinking that it didn't hurt. But, much its surprise, Sandy begins attacking it from the inside and starts glowing while getting bigger.]
SpongeBob: Oh…
Patrick: Pretty.
[The giant jellyfish monster explodes and reduces itself into many harmless, little jellyfish. The jellyfish lower SpongeBob and Patrick down, gently. Patrick releases some jellyfish from his pants. Sandy floats herself down in a calm and gentle feeling.]
SpongeBob: Who are my good little jellies? You are.
Patrick: [pulls out a wallet and gives a jellyfish a dollar] Here you go. Buy yourself something nice.
[SpongeBob giggles happily now that the jellyfish are calmed down.]
Sandy: Well, let's get these little jellies back to their home.
[The scene changes to a newly restored Jellyfish Fields.]
Sandy: [laughs as she gently strokes a jellyfish] They really are sweet. [gets zapped and growls angrily] I'm gonna destroy you! [growls as she chases after the jellyfish]

Mr. Krabs is outside in his boat on the street, waiting for SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: [growls impatiently and honks his horn] SpongeBob! [growls and honks his horn again] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [appears on the passenger seat with a pilot helmet on] Oh, boy! Road trip! [fastens his seatbelt] I hope it lasts forever.
[Mr. Krabs drives up to Old Man Jenkins' farm, which is only ten feet away from the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: And we're here.
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs head for the barn's entrance.]
SpongeBob: Old Man Jenkins' farm?
[The scarecrow starts to shake and Old Man Jenkins' appears from the shirt's opening.]
Old Man Jenkins: Trespassers!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs scream. Mr. Krabs hides in his shell and SpongeBob hides behind him. SpongeBob peaks his eyes out over Mr. Krabs' eyestalk holes. Old Man Jenkins comes out from scarecrow costume and points his pitchfork at Mr. Krabs' face.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa there, Jenkins! [Old Man Jenkins points his pitchfork further, but Mr. Krabs pushes it back] Pull in your plow! I'm here to pay me grocery bill. [holds up his really long bill] Jenkins here supplies all the Krusty Krab's farm fresh ingredients.
SpongeBob: [as Mr. Krabs' bill extends itself] Ooh. [laughs] Yoo-hoo! Whee! [slides on the bill]
Old Man Jenkins: And I expect to be paid for them.
Mr. Krabs: Well, funny you should mention that. [SpongeBob comes up next to Old Man Jenkins in a farmer lady's outfit] SpongeBob here will be your farm hand until me bill's paid off.
SpongeBob: Farm hand! Oh, boy! [rips off his outfit]
Old Man Jenkins: Dagnabbit! If you think you can— [gets cut off by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, look at the time. Gotta go! Hey, boy-o! [hops into his boat] This should help you with your work! [throws out a sack and drives away]
[The sack hits SpongeBob in the face and it skids him across the ground.]
SpongeBob: Huh? Potatoes?
[The sack opens and reveals Patrick eating all the potatoes.]
Patrick: Pat-tatoes! [shows his mouth full of potatoes]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! We can be farming buddies. [hugs Patrick really tight, which makes him spit out the potatoes]
Old Man Jenkins: Now hold on there, youngin'. I can't just let any dern fools work on my farm.
SpongeBob: Oh, we're not just any dern fools.
[SpongeBob and Patrick dig into their mouths and pull out their certified fools badges.]
Patrick: We're certified fools.
Old Man Jenkins: Hm….Well, better hitch up your britches. 'Cause we got tons of chores to get done before the big barn dance tonight!
[Old Man Jenkins' farm and grain silo laugh and dance around. The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins leading SpongeBob and Patrick to the oyster coop.]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy. What's first?
Old Man Jenkins: First thing we do is gatherin' pearly eggs from this oyster coop here. The trick is getting them oysters to open up their clams. [rubs gently on the oyster's chin] Coochie coochie coo.
[The oyster laughs and spits out an egg. Old Man Jenkins takes the egg and shows it to SpongeBob and Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, shiny.
Patrick: Ooh, aww.
Old Man Jenkins: [puts egg in basket] I'll be back in two shakes of a lamprey's tail to see how you're coming along.
[SpongeBob leans in to do the same trick as Old Man Jenkins did.]
SpongeBob: [rubs gently on the oyster's chin] Uh, coochie coo-coochie…
Oyster: [pouts] Uh-uh.
SpongeBob: Okay, that didn't work.
Patrick: SpongeBob, you gotta be more gentle.
[Patrick grabs a crowbar and screams like a crazy maniac. He jumps over and sticks the crowbar in the oyster's mouth. Patrick tries to pry the oyster's mouth open with all his might, but the oyster flips Patrick over.]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
[Patrick whirls around in the air and lands on SpongeBob's face. The crowbar lands in Patrick's mouth and falls flat on the ground. SpongeBob's face is flattened and shaped like Patrick's buttocks before popping itself back in shape. The oysters laugh and spit eggs at SpongeBob and Patrick. Old Man Jenkins comes back and sees the basket still empty.]
Old Man Jenkins: Why, you ain't gathered up a single egg!
[SpongeBob comes over with his mouthful of eggs and spits them in the basket.]
SpongeBob: Well, that was egg-citing. [laughs]
[The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins, SpongeBob, and Patrick at the worm hog pen filled with worm hogs.]
Old Man Jenkins: The next chore is to feed the worm hogs.
[SpongeBob pours a bucket full of slop into the worm hog pen and rings the bell with his nose. The worm hogs run up and begin eating their food. Patrick is also eating the food with the worm hogs.]
Patrick: [swallows the slop] Mmm. Slop.
[One little worm hog is trying to eat some of the food and frantically looks for a place to dig in. But Patrick kicks the little worm hog away.]
SpongeBob: Aww. Are you hingry-wungry cutie-wuite hoggy-woggy? [feeds some slop to the little worm hog and laughs] That tickles. [gasps as the little worm hog begins to swallow him whole]
[SpongeBob screams frantically to break free, but the little worm hog spits SpongeBob out and completely swallows him up before belching out his clothes.]
SpongeBob: Uh, could somebody hand me those?
[Old Man Jenkins sighs in disgust. The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins, SpongeBob and Patrick with a cow-like jellyfish in the farm.]
Old Man Jenkins: Now, you be gentle when you milk Ol' Bessy. [leaves as Ol' Bessy moos]
SpongeBob: Don't you worry. I'll take it easy peasy on the old jelly squeezy.
[SpongeBob grabs a bucket, pulls up a stool and attempts to milk jellyfish jelly from Ol' Bessy's udder. He grabs it and goes to milk it, but the udder sprays jelly on the floor. SpongeBob tries desperately to figure out how to milk it, but the udder keeps spraying jelly all over the place. SpongeBob, had enough with the udder, grabs it and goes to milk the jelly in the bucket. But the udder builds up so much jelly, that it causes Ol' Bessy to get angry and sprays jelly all around.]
Old Man Jenkins: What in tarnation— [gets sprayed by Ol' Bessy's jelly]
[Ol' Bessy gets really angry and throws a fit by kicking everything. She then kicks SpongeBob and Patrick and sends them flying towards Old Man Jenkins. All three of them crash into the farm's front door.]
Patrick: Mmm, a Jenkin Jelly sandwich! [licks jelly off of Old Man Jenkins]
[The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins giving SpongeBob and Patrick their final chore outside the farm. Patrick eats some of Ol' Bessy's jelly while Old Man Jenkins is talking.]
Old Man Jenkins: Your final chore is harvesting my kelp patch.
SpongeBob: [sees a tiny patch of kelp] Ha, this will be a snap.
Old Man Jenkins: Not that patch. That one! [points to really huge field full of kelp]
SpongeBob: [groans] That'll take forever!
Old Man Jenkins: Not if you use my tractor. [points to his tractor]
SpongeBob: But I don't have a tractor license.
Patrick: I got lots of licenses. [shows off his licenses] Driver's license, fishing license, marriage license. Oh, here it is! Tractor license!
[Patrick drives the tractor through the kelp patch. The tractor makes several bails of kelp from the back.]
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick. You're really good at this.
Patrick: The secret is to stay cool as a sea cucumber. I don't want anything to distract— [shouts as he sees a jellybee flying over him] A bee! [screams] Jellybee! [babbles as he tries to shoo it away, but since there is no one steering the wheel, the tractor begins driving around uncontrollably] Get it off, get it off, get it off!
[The tractor trips over a rock and flips around. The jellybee is now sitting on the tractor's steering wheel.]
SpongeBob: Hold on, buddy. [grabs a rope from under the seat] I got it. [throws the rope] Hyah! [misses as it catches the steering wheel] Whoops. [the jellybee flies into SpongeBob's nose, but SpongeBob holds it closed so it won't fly out] Got it.
Patrick: Yay! Don't let it go. [stupidly throws SpongeBob out]
[SpongeBob lands on the ground and gets dragged around by the tractor.]
SpongeBob: [spits out sand] Hey, this is fun.
[The tractor continues to drive while making some kelp bails. SpongeBob skids across the field and dodges the kelp bails.]
SpongeBob: [laughs while dodging the kelp bails] Whoo-hoo!
[The jellybee flies out from one of SpongeBob's holes and stings him from behind. SpongeBob screams in pain and flips over to the front of the tractor in slow-motion. SpongeBob gets caught in the tractor's grinders and comes out all tied up.]
SpongeBob: Did I ""bail"" out too soon? [laughs and breaks free] Oh, boy! Our chores are all done. It's time for the...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Barn dance!
[The tractor drives into Old Man Jenkins' farm and destroys it.]
Old Man Jenkins: How can I have a barn dance with no barn? [sobs]
SpongeBob: Don't you worry your little wrinkly head. 'Cause we're gonna have an old fashioned barn raising.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob holding a barn baby as he rocks it. Patrick fills a baby bottle with nails and gives it to SpongeBob. SpongeBob feeds the barn baby the bottle of nails.]
Patrick: Aww, wee, wee, wee. [gently rubs the barn baby's chin] Coochie coochie coo.
[The barn baby belches out nails. SpongeBob and Patrick are now covered in nails, but it didn't hurt them.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Aww.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob reading a book to the barn kid while Patrick paints red paint on its siding.]
SpongeBob: [reading] ""'A' is for Amoeba. 'B' is for Blobfish.""
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, Patrick and the barn kid playing catch. The barn kid throws the ball at SpongeBob. SpongeBob throws it to Patrick. Patrick throws it back to the barn kid, but it misses as it crashes into the window of Old Man Jenkins' house.]
Old Man Jenkins' house: Oh! You dang kids!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins standing in front of a newly made farm.]
SpongeBob: Congratulations on your barn-mitzvah. Today you are a man-barn.
Patrick: Mazel tov!
SpongeBob: [teary-eyed] Aw, they grow up so fast. [blows his nose]
[The scene changes to nighttime. Old Man Jenkins' new farm is ready for the barn dance. SpongeBob turns on the flashlight and sticks it onto Ol' Bessy. Ol' Bessy moos happily and floats up to the ceiling. She then starts to spin around like a disco ball.]
SpongeBob: Perfect! [Patrick is eating a bucket of worm hog slop] Hey, Patrick. You know what time it is?
Patrick: [pulls his head out of the bucket] Time to put on my ham boots? [points to his feet standing on two hams]
[One worm hog squeals and runs away.]
SpongeBob: Nope! It's time to... [opens the front door]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Partay! [sees no one there] Hmm?
[The wind blows and a tumbleweed rolls by.]
Patrick: Where is everybody?
SpongeBob: When are your other guests coming, Old Man Jenkins?
Old Man Jenkins: [spraying jelly out from Ol' Bessy's udder] Hmm? [wipes the jelly off his beard] What do you mean? This is the biggest turnout I've ever had!
[Suddenly, the ground starts to shake. Outside the farm, a UFO comes flying over and looms downward. The hatch opens and the tractor beam shines down. An object comes out from the UFO, which turns out to be some kind of strange outhouse. The door opens and green smoke fumes. Then, a strange alien appears within the smoke.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I think the party's over.
[The alien looked like is was going to attack SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins. But as the smoke clears, the alien looks almost like a hill-billy farmer.]
Farmer alien: Over? Why, it's just getting started. [pulls out a fiddle and plays music]
[Then some more hill-billy farmer aliens come out and play their instruments. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins join in the fun and dance around with the farmer aliens. The tractor continues driving around the kelp patch as everyone dances.]
SpongeBob: How did you guys know about the barn dance?
Farmer alien: Well, we seen your invitation.
SpongeBob: Invitation? What invitation?
[The farmer alien activates his fiddle and a green glow surrounds it. SpongeBob, Patrick, Old Man Jenkins and the farmer alien are also surrounded in a green glow.]
SpongeBob: Hmm? Wow.
[SpongeBob, Patrick, Old Man Jenkins, and the farmer alien float upward where they can see the view of the farm.]
Farmer alien: ""Barn dance and hoedown tonight. Aliens welcome."" [points down to the strange pattern in the kelp patch created by the tractor]
SpongeBob: Patrick, your crazy tractor driving invited them!
Patrick: [shows off his crop circle license] I have a crop circle license too.
[SpongeBob, Patrick, Old Man Jenkins, and the farmer alien float back down to the ground.]
Farmer alien: Thank you kindly for inviting us, old timer. Well, we're off to destroy the universe. [pulls out a ray gun]
Other farmer aliens: Yee-haw! [shoot their ray guns before heading back into their outhouse]
Old Man Jenkins: [chuckles] Y'all come back and invade any time.
SpongeBob: Annihilate safely.
[The farmer aliens close their outhouse door and the UFO's tractor beam floats them back into their ship before flying away.]
Farmer aliens: [as their UFO flies away] Yee-haw!
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins wave good-bye to the farmer aliens just as Mr. Krabs pulls up in his boat.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey-ho, Jenkins! Has SpongeBob worked off me bill yet?
Old Man Jenkins: [rips the bill in pieces] You're all paid off, Krabs. [rubs SpongeBob's head] Now come back and visit anytime, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Bye, Old Man Jenkins!
[SpongeBob and Patrick hop into Mr. Krabs' boat and they drive away from Old Man Jenkins' farm. SpongeBob is telling Mr. Krabs what they did while Patrick sleeps.]
SpongeBob: Then we gathered pearly eggs, fed the worm hogs, milked Ol' Bessy, and then we met some nice space aliens.
Mr. Krabs: Aliens? That's ridiculous. I think you've been working too hard, boy-o. Looks like you got farm stroke. You must have been hallucinating. There ain't no such thing as UFOs.
SpongeBob: Gee, you think we just imagined it?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, probably— [screams as a tractor beam suddenly shines over them, shocked he was wrong] A UFO!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, there is no such thing as aliens.
[The tractor beam lifts the boat and abducts SpongeBob, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs. Then the UFO turns and flies away into the sky as the tractor drives by the Krusty Krab.]",1.40,Luke Brookshier

Plankton sees this and needs someone stupid enough to want to fix her, and just at the right time, SpongeBob is next to the Chum Bucket. After deciding that the mission will be called ""Operation: Save Karen,"" Plankton transports SpongeBob into Karen to defeat the virus.Plankton gives SpongeBob directions on how to find the virus and soon after he starts looking for it, he falls down into a hole the virus made and sees it eat through Karen. Meanwhile, Karen becomes completely delusional and escapes the Chum Bucket into the Krusty Krab, where she causes chaos. SpongeBob flings back up onto the surface of the inside of Karen and continues searching for destruction caused by the virus, but accidentally activates the security button. Thankfully, before he gets shot by a laser, he is saved by Ideal Plankton, who is what Karen pictures Plankton as.As the virus continues destroying parts of Karen, Ideal Plankton and SpongeBob confront different characters how Karen sees them, and gets into a battle with them. After they defeat them, the two see the virus on the other side of a trench. SpongeBob uses a rope to cross the trench, but when Ideal Plankton tries to cross, part of the ground breaks and he falls into the trench, forcing SpongeBob to have to save Karen by himself.Karen is shown driving a car to a party at Wagon Wheel due to how delusional she is. Inside Karen, the virus is shown to be eating Karen's memories, prompting SpongeBob to try and defeat it. After his attempts fail, he gets so scared he breaks into pieces. When he goes back into normal form, he winds up with one extra piece and throws it onto the ground. The virus eats this, telling SpongeBob that the virus is simply hungry. The episode ends with SpongeBob taking out the virus from Karen and letting him eat a Krabby Patty to satisfy how hungry it is before Plankton abandons it after SpongeBob confronts the virus. Ironically, Karen is still delirious due to the virus formerly being in her body but states she likes it.",Karen's Virus,"[The episode begins at the Chum Bucket. Karen is spending some quality time with another computer named Hanna.]
Karen: Oh, it was so great catching up with you, Hanna. [she and Hanna give a toast to each other] It's been too long.
[Hanna eats a green microchip and sneezes on Karen's computer screen.]
Karen: Oh, you poor thing. Sounds like you have a bug. Better go home and reboot. [escorts Hanna to the door] Remember, only keywords tonight. You need to rest your processor.
Plankton: [off-screen] Karen!
[Plankton is shown waiting for his meal.]
Karen: What do you want? [sneezes and groans while showing the thermometer on her screen]
Plankton: Oh, no. Your nodes are swollen. That old bucket of bolts gave you a computer virus.
Karen: Oh, nonsense. I'm the fastest computer alive. [stammers as she short-circuits and goes haywire]
[Karen rams into the wall.]
Karen: Uh-oh. [laughs] My ones and zeroes look like 10, 10, 10, 10.
Plankton: Someone's gonna have to get inside you and kill that virus. It's probably a suicide mission. (In the UK, the line is cut and gets dubbed over to the next line, because ""suicide"" is an offensive word for Great Britain.) [lifts Karen's hand] But who would be stupid enough to— [hears someone knocking on the door; he opens and it turns out to be SpongeBob hitting it with a hammer on his head] What now?
SpongeBob: [falls over and uses his tongue to get himself up] Oh, I'm just helping out the Health Department.
Plankton: Hmm. [puts on glasses and reads the sign on the door] ""Sanitary notice. The Chum Bucket hereby gets a grade Z from the Health Department."" [throws away the glasses] Hey, that's up from a negative Z last week.
SpongeBob: Congratulations, Plankton. In a few more years, you're sure to get an F. [stuffs his hammer in his hammer, pulls his right leg off, and trips over] Whoa!
Plankton: [throws SpongeBob's leg away] Never mind about that. I have a snow job—Uh, job for you. Karen needs your help. She asked for you personally.
Karen: [off-screen; referencing the first line of a certain Theme Song .] ♪Who lives in a crabapple under a pea♪
SpongeBob: Hey, catchy song.
[The scene changes to Karen, referencing the third lyric of the theme song, being placed on the examination table.]
Karen: ♪Observant and yellow fellow is he♪
[Plankton straps SpongeBob with a backpack with weaponry in it.]
SpongeBob: We need a name for this mission. How about, ""Journey to the Center of Karen?"" No. ""The Mainframe Mission."" Nah. Ooh, I know. ""Operation: Save Karen."" [holds up a drawing of SpongeBob with the words ""Operation: Save Karen"" on it]
Plankton: Whatever, just blast the virus when you see it.
SpongeBob: Oh, like this? [pushes the button and lasers fire all over the place, causing them all to explode] Oops.
Karen: [laughs] That tickles. [laughs]
Plankton: [blows the fire out on his antennas] Here, use this. [gives SpongeBob the flyswatter]
SpongeBob: But Plankton, how am I supposed to— [gets zapped by Plankton's teleporter] Whoa!
[SpongeBob appears on the computer screen about Plankton.]
SpongeBob: [laughs and gets poked by Plankton's injector] Ow!
[Plankton absorbs SpongeBob into the injector and pokes it into medical liter bag. SpongeBob then flows through the bag and into the Karen's computerized blood stream.]
Plankton: [climbs down and comforts Karen] Don't worry, baby. Help is on the way.
Karen: Get away. [smacks Plankton]
[Plankton is sent flying over to some cut wires and gets himself electrocuted.]
Plankton: Ow!
[The screen zooms into Karen's hard drive while she downloads SpongeBob. The screen shows Karen's hard drive being created and SpongeBob is digitally teleported in her.]
SpongeBob: [shakes the data particles off] Whoa! [sees the inside of Karen for the first time. Tall structures on the motherboard spread out before SpongeBob like a bustling city.] Super-awesome-ular-tastic! [his eyeballs inflate and pop] Wow! [restores his eyeballs] Huh?
[A computerized megaphone appears next to SpongeBob.]
Plankton: [via megaphone] SpongeBob, can you hear me? [normal] Come in, SpongeBob. [dodges Karen's incoming arm] Talk to me, you digitized doofus!
SpongeBob: Plankton, I do not respond to insults.
Plankton: [via megaphone; sighs] Okay. Just look for any destruction and follow it to the virus. Sweetheart.
SpongeBob: Got it, Honey. [skips backwards until he comes to a hole created by the virus; he falls downward] Whoa!
[SpongeBob grabs onto a loose wire to prevent himself from falling. But he loses the flyswatter as it falls and gets eaten by the virus. Meanwhile, outside of Karen's body, Karen gets off the examination table and rips the medical bag off her.]
Karen: [laughs] I want a Krabby Patty!
Plankton: Baby!
Karen: [plows through the door] Bye-bye!
Plankton: [follows her outside] SpongeBob, hurry up and kill that virus before it completely destroys Karen!
[Karen picks up a boat and throws it in the sky, destroying the Krusty Krab sign and making a flower cloud fall. Plankton's jaw drops and his eyeball falls on his tongue in shock.]
Karen: Knock, knock! [rips the front door off the Krusty Krab]
Plankton: Huh? Great Neptune's nostrils! [sticks his eyeball back and runs to the Krusty Krab]
[Back inside Karen, SpongeBob falls into the hole and lands in a puddle of green slime.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [picks up a sample of the green slime] Hmm. [gasps] The virus!
[SpongeBob follows slime trail and sees the destruction the virus created.]
SpongeBob: Plankton, it looks like the virus is heading to Karen's memory banks.
[Back at the Krusty Krab, Karen is going on a rampage all over the place.]
Plankton: Listen, if it gets to her memory, it'll fry her hard drive completely. I need you to destroy that virus right now! [Mr. Krabs enters the scene, and Plankton looks worried]
Mr. Krabs: Plankton, I need you to control your wife. Er, computer, or whatever.
Plankton: Mind your own business, Eugene.
Mr. Krabs: This is my business! [The Krusty Krab is now on fire as customers are everywhere, boats destroyed the walls and lots of broken stuff Karen just did.]
[Karen grabs and throws Squidward away. She then climbs into the register boat and begins flirting with the cash register.]
Karen: Hello there, baby! Where've you been all my life?
Mr. Krabs: [screams and grabs the cash register] Please don't break up our happy home. I forgive you, baby. [kisses the cash register, heads into his office and closes his door]
Plankton: [disgusted at the Karen and Mr. Krabs moment] Wow, I can never unsee that.
[Back inside Karen, SpongeBob pulls himself up a ledge and sees everything dark. He looks around to see if there's any destruction caused by the virus, but he accidentally activates a security button.]
Karen: Intruder detected.
[The floor glows and lasers fire at SpongeBob. But just as SpongeBob was about to get blasted, someone pushed him safely out of the way. It was a computerized version of Plankton, but he's taller, muscular, and more heroic than his evil counterpart. He is called Ideal Plankton. Ideal Plankton pulls out a laser gun and blasts the lasers with it. He opens the floor, grabs SpongeBob and falls through it. He and SpongeBob land safely on the ground.]
SpongeBob: Plankton?
Ideal Plankton: That's my name. [his teeth glimmers] Actually, I'm Karen's version of Plankton. You know, how she'd like to see me. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Ooh, you have beautiful eye. [rubs Ideal Plankton's eye]
Ideal Plankton: We'd better get moving.
[Ideal Plankton runs off while SpongeBob follows. Meanwhile, the virus is eating up everything in Karen's hard drive. The virus eats up the House of Anger.]
Karen: Anger control center abolished.
[The virus then eats up the Tunnel of Love.]
Karen: Love center destroyed.
[Ideal Plankton climbs up a wall with SpongeBob on his back. He punches a hole through the wall and climbs through it. The wall turns right-side up, revealing itself to be a floor. SpongeBob and Ideal Plankton climb out from the floor while all of a sudden, a virus version of Mr. Krabs appears.]
Money Krabs: Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money...
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, is that you?
Ideal Plankton: It's Karen's version of Krabs.
SpongeBob: Hey, looking good, Mr. K.
[Then a blue, slimy, and ugly virus version of Squidward appears.]
Gnarly Squid: I hate everything. [drops to the ground and leaks slime]
Ideal Plankton: That's how Karen sees Squidward.
SpongeBob: Hmm? [puts make-up on] Uh, nothing like a little make-up couldn't fix. [chuckles] Hey, I wonder if Karen has a version of me down here.
[A virus version of SpongeBob appears.]
Off Model SpongeBob: Woop, woop, zing, zing. Woop, woop, zing, zing.
SpongeBob: Ooh, now that guy's a hunk.
[Suddenly, the siren goes off.]
Karen: Intruder in section B. Eliminate.
[Off Model SpongeBob, Gnarly Squid, and Money Krabs fire laser beams at SpongeBob and Ideal Plankton. SpongeBob and Ideal Plankton dodge the incoming lasers. Ideal Plankton blasts Money Krabs into little pennies, which have faces of Money Krabs on them.]
SpongeBob: [gets hit by the pennies] Ow! [blows the pennies out of his holes and grabs one of them; the penny then bites SpongeBob's thumb] Yeowch! [drops the penny]
[Ideal Plankton grabs Gnarly Squid and squeezes him really tight.]
Gnarly Squid: Owie, owie, owie. [explodes into a puddle of slime]
Ideal Plankton: What a drip.
[Off Model SpongeBob comes charging towards SpongeBob.]
Off Model SpongeBob: Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
[SpongeBob screams and runs over to Off Model SpongeBob.]
Off Model SpongeBob: Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
[SpongeBob continues to run and scream as he rams into Off Model SpongeBob. But in doing so, he transforms into an exact copy of Off Model SpongeBob himself.]
SpongeBob: Duh.
Off Model SpongeBob: Duh.
SpongeBob: Doy.
Off Model SpongeBob: Doy.
SpongeBob: Duh.
Off Model SpongeBob: Duh.
SpongeBob: Doy.
Off Model SpongeBob: Doy.
Ideal Plankton: Neptune's network! Which one of you is the real SpongeBob?
[SpongeBob and Off Model SpongeBob point at each other. Then stare at themselves in confusion.]
Ideal Plankton: I'll have to use all the computation power I have to figure this out. Eeny, meeny, miney, moe. [blasts Off Model SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Duh, duh, doy, doy. Duh, duh, doy, doy.
Ideal Plankton: Oh, no. I think I destroyed the wrong SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Duh, duh, doy— [shakes himself back to his normal form] How do I look?
Ideal Plankton: Stunning.
[Just then, an explosion knocks over Ideal Plankton from behind. Out from the smoke appears the virus. It roars and lets out blobs of green slime everywhere.]
Ideal Plankton: Hmm. Voracious virus!
[The virus slithers over to Karen's memory banks. Ideal Plankton sees a wire dangling from above.]
Ideal Plankton: There's still time to save Karen. [pulls off one of his antennas, ties it to a wire and through it to the lose wire for them to swing across] You first.
[SpongeBob swings across while imitating a Tarzan-like yell. He barely makes it to the ledge.]
SpongeBob: Whoops. Did I do good?
[Part of the ledge crumbles under Ideal Plankton's feet.]
Ideal Plankton: You did great. But I think you could use a little push.
[Ideal Plankton uses his eyeball to push SpongeBob closer to the other side.]
SpongeBob: Whoa, okay, your turn.
[But before Ideal Plankton can have his turn to swing across, the ground beneath him gave way and he falls into the ravine below.]
Ideal Plankton: It's up to you, SpongeBob! You must save Karen!
SpongeBob: No!
Ideal Plankton: What do you mean, no?!
SpongeBob: I mean, yes!
[Meanwhile, outside of her body, Karen is driving crazily in a boatmobile with Plankton sitting in the passenger seat.]
Plankton: Uh, sweetie, maybe we should slow down and pull over. Honey? Precious?
Karen: No way, Plankie! It's me and you, amigo! Whoo-hoo! [drives over to the Wagon Wheel] Oh, hot dog! Let's go dancing! Whoo-hoo! [crashes the boat and enters the Wagon Wheel to join some square dancers] Whoo-hoo, yeah! Whoo-hoo!
Plankton: How are all these people able to dance here in the middle of the day? Don't they have jobs?
Karen: Whoo! [laughs and spins]
[Plankton is flung over to a female square dancer.]
Plankton: SpongeBob, come in, SpongeBob! If you're gonna do anything, do it now! Karen's about to melt down!
[Karen's computer screen begins to glow red and heat up.]
Female hick: Oh, such a cute one-eyed baby.
Plankton: SpongeBob!
[Back inside of Karen, SpongeBob makes it to the memory banks, in which he dashes to the entrance off. Inside, SpongeBob sees various memories Karen stored from the past. All the memories are pink, brain-shaped structures and they're showing footage from older episodes. The virus slithers over to one memory and takes a bite from it. The screen shows nothing but static after he's eaten it. SpongeBob runs between some columns, with one destroyed as a casualty of the virus. He runs up to the virus and forms himself into a stop sign shape as a confrontation to the virus.]
SpongeBob: Stop munching on those memories, you monster!
[The virus turns and charges in on SpongeBob. But SpongeBob dodges it and the virus roars out green slime, and it splatters onto SpongeBob, in which he spins around and has on his karate gear after he stops spinning.]
SpongeBob: [having donned his karate gear] Hi-yah!
[The virus morphs itself into a towering dragon and blows fire at SpongeBob. The fire engulfs SpongeBob and when the flames dissipate, SpongeBob's karate gear is replaced with pink cat attire.]
SpongeBob: [nervously] Meow?
[SpongeBob makes a run for it, with the virus trailing right behind. SpongeBob runs past more memories until he runs into a brick wall, which is a dead end.]
SpongeBob: Plankton, I'm at the edge of Karen's memory! She has to create more memories! I need space to run.
[Outside of her body, Karen bursts out from the Wagon Wheel and heads straight for Bikini Bottom.]
Plankton: [running after her] Is my running after here enough of a memory?
[We cut back to inside Karen's body, but the wall only moves a few inches.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm afraid not.
[A shadow looms over SpongeBob, who presses his back against the wall in fear. The virus dragon blows smoke from his nostrils like a bull, and he closes in on SpongeBob, only for his body parts to disassemble and scatter as the virus reverts back to normal.  SpongeBob spins and puts himself back together, holding one yellow cube in his hand.]
SpongeBob: I always wind up with one extra piece. [He throws it on the ground and the virus eats it.] Oh, you must be hungry. That's why you're eating through Karen.
Virus: [with a pleading face] I'm always hungry.
SpongeBob: [rubbing his face sympathetically] You poor, ugly, disgusting little virus. I know what you need.
[Back outside, Karen grows tired and her screen steams up smoke. Then she finally stops moves and shuts off.]
Plankton: SpongeBob, I've decided to pull you out! We're abandoning Operation: Save Karen .
SpongeBob: [opens up Karen's screen like a door] I got the virus. [jumps out with a microscope] Look.
[Plankton looks through the microscope and sees the virus.]
Virus: Hi, there!
SpongeBob: [grabs the virus and puts it on a Krabby Patty. The virus may have been huge when SpongeBob journeyed through Karen, but it looks a lot smaller on top of the Krabby Patty.] Here you go, little fella. It'll take the virus 300 years to chew its way through this sandwich.
Virus: Whoo-hoo!
Karen: [wakes up] Oh. Huh?
Plankton: [being shown as Ideal Plankton as Karen looks at him] Baby, you're all right!
Karen: Nope. I'm still delirious. But I like it! [laughs crazily. The episode irises out and then ends.]",1.20,Kaz

He eats some trash, but Patrick is also eating there and does not want to share. He roars at the starfish, causing him to get scared and run away.The animal control appears and spots Gary, but he runs away before he can catch him. He goes to the Chum Bucket and goes inside through a secret entrance, where he meets up with Spot, his best friend.The two go out of the restaurant and play with each other, but eventually get hungry and go to the Krusty Krab. While they are eating, Marvin, the animal control officer, arrives there and attempts to catch the two, but he fails, and they escape. Mr. Krabs arrives and gets angry with the officer for tripping his silent alarm and thinks he made a mess of his restaurant.Gary and Spot run away and hide at a sunken ship, but it turns out it had already been occupied. Thankfully, they were already friends with everyone in there, and they have a party. Marvin reaches them and starts dancing to the music, until it gets turned off due to the DJ getting shocked by the officer's presence.He takes all the animals except Gary and Spot, so the two go to the Animal Shelter to rescue them. After getting in and releasing all the animals, Gary finds out that Marvin is sad, as he is lonely. He tells the others this, and they all set up a dinner with a woman made out of slime. He falls in love with her at first sight and marries her soon after. He releases all the animals to thank them for bringing love into his life. Gary and Spot go back to their homes. As the episode ends, Sandy wraps up the tale by telling the viewers to stay tuned for more true to life tales of Bikini Bottom. Gary shushes her, making the latter groan in annoyance and concluding the episode.",Gary & Spot,"[The episode begins at nighttime in Bikini Bottom.]
Sandy: Howdy, neighbor. It's your old pal, Sandy Cheeks with a true to life tale direct from Bikini Bottom. It's the end of another long day, and every critter in town is getting ready to hit the hay.
[Fred is shown brushing his teeth and Debbie Rechid is reading a bedtime story to her child.]
Farmer fish: [punches the hay stack and forms into a bed] Whoo-hoo! [jumps on the hay bed and goes to sleep]
[The scene goes to SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob and Gary are getting ready for bed.]
Sandy: Even little old SpongeBob and Gary are laying down their weary heads.
SpongeBob: [crawls into bed with Gary] Night Gare-bear. [yawns and goes to sleep]
Sandy: Now snails love to sleep, but they also like to have their fun. And clever little Gary here is no different. [giggles as Gary forms a slime decoy of himself and slithers off the bed] With a dang nifty decoy in place, Gary is ready to hit the town.
[Gary exits SpongeBob's house and slithers to Squidward's garbage cans.]
Sandy: But first things first. That gooey little varmint is mighty hungry. [chuckles as Gary climbs into the garbage cans and eats some trash] It may not look like much to you and me, but this here is four-star dining to a snail. [laughs]
[Gary hops over to another garbage can and eats some more trash. Suddenly, Patrick appears from the trash and he looks angry.]
Sandy: Now, Gary never minds running into a friend, but old Patrick here don't seem ready to share his meal.
[Patrick and Gary hop out of the garbage cans and they chase around. Patrick barks at Gary like a mad dog. Gary makes a loud roar, which terrifies Patrick. Patrick then turns and runs away.]
Sandy: Ol' Gary feels as big as a ten-point buck right now, but he's about to be reminded that life ain't all fun and games. Especially when animal control is on your tail.
[Just like what Sandy said, a truck pulls over and an animal control officer named Marvin appears.]
Marvin: Freeze, slime ball!
Gary: Meow. [slithers away]
Marvin: Hmm? [growls]
[Marvin goes to chase Gary, but he slips on the trash goo. He falls onto the ground while getting his capture pole tangled to his head. With Marvin all tangled up, Gary laughs and checks his watch. He then tiptoes away.]
Sandy: As much as Gary likes getting one over on the heat, he has more important matters to attend to.
[The scene changes to Gary slithering to the Chum Bucket.]
Sandy: This here is old Plankton's restaurant, the Chum Bucket. Gary ain't here for vittles, though. No one's ever at the Chum Bucket for vittles.
[Gary enters the Chum Bucket through the restaurant's sign. He breaks through the ceiling vet where he almost woke Plankton up with the metal door. He then slithers across the ceiling. Gary's slime drops into Plankton's mouth. Plankton coughs and spits the slime out before going back to sleep.]
Gary: Whew!
[Spot is shown sleeping on Plankton's bed.]
Sandy: That there's Spot. Plankton's pet amoeba and Gary's best friend.
Gary: Psst.
[Spot wakes up and starts barking.]
Sandy: Spot's cute, but about as dumb as a barrel of hair. [Spot's barking is making Plankton and Karen uncomfortable to sleep] Gary better think quick or they'll both be busted before their night's even begun.
[Karen puts earmuffs on her monitor and goes back to sleep. Gary lowers his left eye stalk to cover Spot's mouth. But Spot forms a mouth on the other end of his body and resumes barking. Karen bangs on the desk to stop the noise. She accidentally hits Plankton.]
Plankton: Ough! [groans before going back to sleep]
[Gary covers Spot's other end and lifts him up. Then Gary and Spot leave the Chum Bucket to begin their nighttime activities.]
Sandy: Ol' Gary and Spot have been sneaking out for ages though their owners are none the wiser. [giggles as Gary and Spot play together] They love playing all sorts of games together, but their doggone favorite is wrestling.
[Gary and Spot wrestle around for a while until they flung themselves through the chimney of the Krusty Krab. They both end up on top of the grill in the kitchen.]
Sandy: It's the Krusty Krab kitchen. What a stroke of luck.
[Gary looks around for Spot until he finds him.]
Sandy: Gary and Spot must have worked up quite an appetite with all them fun and games.
[Gary and Spot's stomachs growl and they smell something really good. The smell is coming from the refrigerator. Gary and Spot's mouths water and they go to the fridge to get some food. But unfortunately, the door is locked.]
Sandy: Uh oh. That ice box is locked up tighter than a horse thief in a hoosegow.
[Spot gets so mad with hunger. He barks and knocks everything over, making a big mess in the kitchen. He hits the fridge and knocks it over before flying out into the dining room. The fridge opens and food comes out.]
Sandy: Oh boy. It's chow time.
[Gary goes to eat until he hears Spot barking in the dining room. Gary sees how hungry Spot is and comes up with an idea. He morphs himself to look like SpongeBob and imitates the SpongeBob laughter. Spot happily barks and hops onto the tables while knocking them over. He peeks into the kitchen and sees what Gary's cooking. Gary is piling up food onto a plate and makes a humongous sandwich.]
Sandy: Whoo-whee! Looks like Gary is cooking up some fun.
[Gary pushes the plateful of food on the window and rings the bell. The food falls onto Spot and Gary jumps out. Gary and Spot then go to eat their meal.]
Sandy: It may not be pretty, but to a critter, chow is chow.
[Gary and Spot both eat all of the food until there's nothing left. Then they go to play around, leaving the Krusty Krab a big mess. At the very same moment, Marvin drives by, looking for Gary.]
Marvin: Come out, come out. [gasps as he hears Gary in the Krusty Krab] Oh, there you are. [bursts through the front door and Gary and Spot stop playing; he slips on the floor, but gets up] Ha ha! I've got you this time. [slips on the Krabby Patty and falls on his face]
[Gary and Spot quickly run off to escape the animal control officer. Just then, Mr. Krabs comes in and is not very happy.]
Mr. Krabs: Ahem.
Marvin: [holds up his license, but is covered in tomato goo] Animal control, citizen. I'm hunting an errant snail.
Mr. Krabs: I don't give a sea fig about snails! You tripped me silent alarm! [points to an alarm bell with a mime face on it while making a faint tapping noise] Just look at this mess! [attacks Marvin with his claws] Take that, you varmint! [continues attacking Marin] Take that!
Marvin: Ow! Ow! Ow!
[Gary and Spot escape the Krusty Krab while Mr. Krabs continues to attack Marvin.]
Sandy: [giggles] Looks like our boys gave Johnny law the slip again. [Gary and Spot head over to an old sunken ship] Reckon they're gonna need some place to lay low for a while.
Gary and Spot: Whew!
[Suddenly, eerie eyes appear from the darkness. The eyes get closer and reveal themselves to be random animals. Snails, worms, sea urchins, and sea horses.]
Sandy: Uh oh. Looks like their hiding spot's already occupado.
[Just when it looks as though the animals are going to attack Gary and Spot, they instead huddle with them for they seem to know them.]
Sandy: Luckily for them, Gary and Spot are already pals with everyone here.
Patrick: Let's get this party started!
[One worm, who is the DJ, cranks up the music and all of the animals including Patrick dances. However, at that very same moment, Marvin drives up and hears the music.]
Sandy: Uh oh. Looks like the fuzz ain't gonna give up so easy.
Marvin: Hey, this is my jam. [goes in to join in the dancing]
Sandy: They say that music soothes the savage beast.
Marvin: [slides in and dances to the music] Oh, yeah, Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Sandy: But sometimes it works on knuckleheads too.
Marvin: [spins on the floor] That's how you do it. You do it. You do it. [stops dancing; the DJ worm stops the music in shock] Uh, you animals are under arrest? [the animals and Patrick growl angrily] Uh... Uh oh.
[The animals and Patrick lunge at Marvin and attack him.]
Sandy: Youch! That's gotta hurt. Oh mama!
[Gary and Spot abandon the fight and escape the sunken ship. They both hide behind a rock. Marvin comes out and throws Patrick and the animals into his truck. Then he drives away.]
Sandy: I guess this party just got pooped. [Spot cries, but Gary comforts him] Luckily, SpongeBob's little Gare-bear always has something under his shell.
[Spot slithers under Gary to form wheels. Then Gary and Spot follow the truck to the animal shelter. They both slam into the front door, which is locked up tight.]
Sandy: Locked doors are never a problem for a snail like Gary.
[Gary forms a slime key and Spot uses it to unlock the door. Spot gives Gary the A-Ok and the duo enter the animal shelter. As they wonder down the hallway, they see their animal friends and Patrick locked in cages.]
Sandy: Now to most animals, the pound is scarier than a bobcat in your long johns. But Gary and Spot are on a mission to save their pals.
[They continue wondering down the hallway while seeing everyone looking depressed while being imprisoned. But when they reached the end of the hallway, they find an emergency cage release lever.]
Gary: Ah-ha!
[Spot hops onto Gary's shell, takes his left eye stalk and lassos the lever to pull it down. The cages open and Patrick and the animals are free.]
Patrick: Huh? [cheers with the other animals]
Gary: [softly] Meow! Shhh!
[Patrick and the animals stop cheering. They all slither to the officer. Gary peeks in the office and sees Marvin feeling sad.]
Gary: Hmm?
Marvin: Oh, Marvin, you can catch every snail in Bikini Bottom, but the only thing you've really caught is loneliness. [cries and coughs] And kennel cough.
Gary: [sadly] Meow.
Sandy: Marvin here ain't kith nor kin to Gary, but that don't matter none. Gary could never bear to see anyone looking so down.
Marvin: [blows his nose through a tissue] I need another snot rag. [leaves his office]
[Gary turns to Patrick and the other animals and tells them about Marvin's problem. Patrick and the animals look at each other in worry. Marvin comes back in the office with another tissue and blows his nose in it.]
Marvin: Hey! How did you animals get out?
[Gary, Spot and the animals suddenly appear dressed up in fancy clothes and playing smooth jazz music. One worm slithers up to Marvin.]
Marvin: Wh—wh—what's going on?
[The worm takes Marvin to the table and sets him down on the chair. Patrick comes in and holds out a can of generic snail food.]
Patrick: Et voilà. [opens the can with his teeth and pours the food on his plate]
[Gary spits out some slime and forms it into a beautiful woman.]
Marvin: [gasps] She's beautiful.
[Marvin falls in love with the slime woman and takes her on a date to Glove World!. They both ride the roller coaster, but the slime hits the people in back of them, much to the disgust. Then they both have a caricature draw a picture of them.]
Marvin: Oh! That's so good!
[Sometime later, Marvin and the slime woman he called Alice are having a wedding at the animal shelter.]
Marvin: I do. [kisses Alice]
[Patrick, the animals and the wedding attendees cheer happily.]
Marvin: I can't thank you all enough. You brought love into my lonely life. Everybody's free to go. [opens the front door]
[Patrick and the animals happily run out.]
Patrick: [laughs] Why am I running?
[Gary and Spot both slither out and head back to the Chum Bucket.]
Sandy: With their friends rescued, it's time for our boys to finally get some shut eye.
[Spot licks Gary, climbs up to the restaurant's sign and waves goodbye to Gary before going back in. Gary turns and heads back to SpongeBob's house. Upon arriving there, he sees Squidward grumbling to himself while he's picking up the trashy mess Gary and Patrick made.]
Gary: Meow?
[Gary slithers back into SpongeBob's house and climbs back into the bed, pushing the slime decoy away. He then slithers into SpongeBob's arms and goes to sleep.]
Sandy: After his long night of adventuring, Gary is more tired than a bronco on busting day.
[Just then, the alarm clock goes off.]
SpongeBob: [wakes up and gasps] Come on, Gary, you lazybones. It's time to wake up.
[Gary wakes up and gives SpongeBob a friendly smile.]
SpongeBob: Oh, well, maybe a few more minutes wouldn't hurt. [goes back to sleep with Gary]
Sandy: Well, that's the long and short of it. See y'all next time for more true to life tales of Bikini Bottom.
Gary: Shh!
[Sandy groans in annoyance and the screen turns black, ending the episode.]",1.21,Andrew Goodman

As they talk about the day they had, they start to get hungry. SpongeBob wishes they could go to the Krusty Krab but it doesn't stay open that late. However, Patrick slaps him and says it does. It turns out the restaurant does have a night shift, and the customers as well as the workers are different from the usual ones. The two go to the cashier, Squidabeth, for Krabby Patties, but since they don't serve that during the night shift, they order the Great Pacific garbage patch.SpongeBob wants to thank the cook for making the great meal he ordered, so he goes into the kitchen to do so. However, since he shook the cook's hands so hard, they get hurt and a backup cook is needed as Barry the Blobfish, the cook, is unable to do so. After Nosferatu checks SpongeBob to see if he can take over Barry's job, SpongeBob starts making Krabby Patties. However, the customers who come during the night shift dislike them.While SpongeBob is trying to find something he thinks the customers will like, the Krabby Patties that were already getting cooked burn and the smoke that came out of them form into the shape of a Krabby Patty. The night shift customers enjoy these and all praise SpongeBob. Afterwards, the fisherman comes to the restaurant to rob their money. SpongeBob stops him from doing so by fighting with him and putting him inside the deep fryer, but it turns out the fisherman was robbing the place because it was their tradition.SpongeBob apologizes to the fisherman, and the fisherman apologizes back. The fisherman decides to order many night patties, and right after, it's time for the night shift to end. Everyone except SpongeBob then leaves, and Mr. Krabs comes inside, wondering why SpongeBob is at work so early. SpongeBob explains he was helping the night shift, but a confused Mr. Krabs reveals the Krusty Krab doesn't have a night shift and believes he was just dreaming before telling SpongeBob to get to work. The episode ends with SpongeBob sitting on a fish hook, and the French Narrator reveals that SpongeBob had worked a shift in The Tidal Zone, and everything he saw during this time period, including Patrick, was just an illusion.",The Night Patty,"[The episode begins at Glove World during the night. The park's lights turn off.]
Park employee: Beat it, we're closed! [kicks SpongeBob and Patrick out]
SpongeBob: Whoa, there is nothing better than spending 18 hours at Glove World, even if my feet are a bit tired. [his toes snore]
Patrick: Mine are hungry. [his feet grumble]
SpongeBob: [sighs] Too bad the Krusty Krab doesn't stay open this late.
Patrick: [goofily slaps SpongeBob and points to the Krusty Krab] Of course it does! See?
SpongeBob: Huh? Mr. Krabs never mentioned we had a night shift.
[SpongeBob and Patrick run over to the restaurant and enter through the doors. However, what they see inside is not something he normally sees everyday.]
SpongeBob: Huh?
[Inside the restaurant, there are creepy sea creatures who came from Rock Bottom and monsters that no one has ever seen before.]
Creepy sea creatures: Patrick!
Patrick: Hi, guys!
SpongeBob: You sure are popular.
Patrick: I come here every night.
[SpongeBob turns and sees a blue creature. It opens its mouth and its tongue laughs at him. SpongeBob screams and runs over to Patrick. He clings onto Patrick's back. A sea anemone swallows a customer and spits him out in skeleton form.]
Jennifer: Hi, Patrick.
Chuck: Long time no see, man.
Patrick: Hi, Jennifer. Hi, Chuck.
[Chuck slurps on a soda. SpongeBob is completely scared at what he's seeing. He tries to tiptoe out, but bumps into an invisible man.]
Invisible Stan: Good evening.
SpongeBob: Whoa!
[A crab-like monster sneaks up behind SpongeBob with a plate of food.]
Maitre'd: Amuse-bouche, sir? Isopod fillets sprinkled with polyps on a bed of seagrass, drizzled with coral slime and just a soupçon of algae. [pops his lips]
Invisible Stan: Don't mind if I do. [takes a sample and eats it] Mmm. Mmm, mmm, not bad. [passes gas] Pardon me.
[SpongeBob jumps backwards and gets impaled by a claw from a spider creature]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey.
Spider creature: Sorry, buddy. [shakes SpongeBob off and plops him down]
SpongeBob: The night shift certainly attracts a different crowd.
Patrick: Come over here, SpongeBob. I want you to meet someone. SpongeBob, this is Squidabeth.
SpongeBob: Huh?
[Patrick shows Squidabeth to SpongeBob, who looks a little bit like Squidward, but a lot more nicer and well-meaning to everyone.]
Squidabeth: Good to meet you, Mr. Bob. [jumps into the register boat]
SpongeBob: Oh, a pleasure mademoiselle.
Squidabeth: [giggles] Ain't you a little charmer? [pinches SpongeBob's cheek]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Yeah, I am.
Squidabeth: [accidentally rips SpongeBob's cheek off] What you fixin' to have, honey child?
SpongeBob: One Krabby Patty, please?
Squidabeth: A Krabby what? We ain't got none of those, hon.
SpongeBob: You don't serve [cringes] Krabby Patties?
Squidabeth: But we got lots of other tasty vittles. [pulls down the menu]
SpongeBob: [reading the menu] ""Howling rings, sucker shakes, boo-gers, crawly fries?""
Patrick: [holds up some money] Give us the works!
Squidabeth: One great Pacific garbage patch!
Barry Blobfish: Order up! [hands Squidabeth Patrick's order]
Patrick: Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. [Squidabeth serves Patrick his order] You gotta try a sucker shake. [gives SpongeBob the sucker shake and slurps his own; the shake pops out of the cup and sucks on his face; Patrick sucks the shake and swallows it] Ah, drink up, buddy!
SpongeBob: I'm—
[SpongeBob's sucker shake pops out of his cup. SpongeBob hides behind Patrick and the shake flies into the invisible man's mouth. He drinks it and swallows it.]
Invisible Stan: Yum.
[The sucker shake screams inside the invisible man's stomach.]
Patrick: The howling rings are a scream. [eats some howling rings and howls like a wolf]
[SpongeBob tries some of the howling rings and howls like a wolf as well. They chew on the rings and swallow.]
SpongeBob: A little different, but I like it. Give the chef my compliments.
Squidabeth: Why, tell him yourself, sweetie. You got a visitor!
Barry Blobfish: Come on back!
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter the kitchen and meet a blobfish creature who is cooking the meals.]
Barry Blobfish: Hey there, night feeders. Name's Barry Blobfish. Good to know ya.
SpongeBob: Good to meet you, Barry. I'm SpongeBob. [crushes Barry's hand by accident]
Barry Blobfish: Yikes! [groans] Oh, that's my cooking hand.
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry. Used my spatula arm. [shows off his muscular arm]
[Suddenly, the restaurant begins to shake.]
Squidabeth: Night train!
[The engine and its night train arrive in, delivering a long line of customers.]
Barry Blobfish: Oh, no, the midnight rush. What am I gonna do? Oh, if only there was a fry cook in the house.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm a certified fry cook! [takes out his wallet and shows Barry his license]
Barry Blobfish: Oh, let's see. I'd have to clear it with the night manager. Hey, boss, can this little fella here take over my shift tonight?
[The cooler opens and Barry's boss is revealed to be none other than Nosferatu.]
SpongeBob: Nosferatu?
[Nosferatu grabs SpongeBob and examines him. He takes out a straw and sucks him dry. He gives Barry a thumbs up.]
Barry Blobfish: You got the job, kid. [puts his hat on SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: Hooray!
Barry Blobfish: Whew. Now I can pass out in peace. [groans and passes out]
Patrick: Invisible Stan, let's get him to a hospital. [he and Invisible Stan carry Barry out] Wounded fry cook coming through!
Squidabeth: Hey get your grill in gear! The crowd's getting restless!
SpongeBob: Uh, yes, ma'am!
[Nosferatu goes back into the cooler.]
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah. [throws a pile of patties on the grill] They are gonna love this. [flips the patties with two spatulas and comes out with a plate full of Krabby Patties] Here, try a sample from the daytime menu.
[All of the creepy creatures grabs the Krabby Patties and goes to eat them. At first, things are going fine until they started to spit them out. It appears that none of the creatures like Krabby Patties at all.]
Squidabeth: What the devilish did you make?
SpongeBob: Well, Krabby Patties, of course.
Squidabeth: [gags] You tryin' to poison us?! [the customers throw their patties at SpongeBob] Quit fooling around and cook up something edible!
[SpongeBob pops out of the pile and spits the patties out from his eyes.]
SpongeBob: [distraught] That's impossible. [gets pushed back in the kitchen by Squidabeth] Everyone loves Krabby Patties. What kind of a weird upside-down place is this?
Squidabeth: [throws the pile of patties on the grill] And no more of that daytime slop!
SpongeBob: Krabby Patties aren't slop. [a patty slides down the grill and SpongeBob goes over to the cooler] Got to be something they like in here. [pulls out Nosferatu] No. [pulls out a robot similar to Sandy's robot from ""What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?""] No. [pulls out a statue similar to the statue from ""Are You Happy Now?""] No. [pulls out the heart man] No. [pulls out a cave sponge frozen in an ice block] No. [sniffs and sees the grill burning the Krabby Patties] Huh? Oh, no!
[SpongeBob goes to put the patties out, but gets blasted away by the flames. The Krabby Patties are now completely burned and are reduced to ashes. The patties are now transcended into smoke. Squidabeth comes in to see what was the noise and sees the smoke-shaped patties floating over the grill.]
Squidabeth: Oh, now, lookie here. Night patties! Now you're getting the swing of it.
SpongeBob: N-N-Night patties?
Squidabeth: Order up, people!
Creepy sea creatures: All right, Night Patties. Tasty. [they each grab a Night Patty and start to eat them]
Unnamed creature: [eats a Night Patty and ghostly smoke steams out from his nostrils] Smooth.
[One creature eats the Night Patty and ghostly smoke steams out from his head. SpongeBob tries a Night Patty and ghostly smoke steams out from his holes.]
SpongeBob: Smoky.
Creepy sea creatures: [run over to SpongeBob and lift him up] Hooray! Yeah! Hip, hip, hooray!
[Soon, everyone is enjoying the Night Patties SpongeBob made. Then all of a sudden, a ghostly fisherman bursts through the front door.]
Fisherman: Everybody down on the floor!
Angler fish: It's the Fisherman!
[The creepy creatures scream and hide under the tables.]
Two creatures: No, not the Fisherman!
Fisherman: Now hand over the moola.
[The creatures do exactly what the Fisherman says and drops money in his net. Squidabeth opens the cash register and the Fisherman takes the money. The Fisherman heads for the door until SpongeBob takes notice of him.]
SpongeBob: Well, good evening, sir. Welcome to the Krusty Krab.
Fisherman: Give me all your money!
SpongeBob: Well, I'm always glad to help a fellow out with a loan. [takes his wallet out and goes to give money to the Fisherman]
Fisherman: Loan? I don't want a loan. I'm the Fisherman! I'm robbing the place.
SpongeBob: Well, that is downright unfriendly. I'm putting you under fry cook's arrest. [holds out his license and onion ring handcuffs]
Fisherman: Huh? [holds out his fishing pole] Oh, really? [laughs]
[The Fisherman throws his line and hooks SpongeBob by the pants. He then begins to reel him in like catching a fish. SpongeBob grabs onto a table and holds on for life. SpongeBob is then pulled back by the fishing line, but grabs another table. The Fisherman cackles and is about to catch SpongeBob with his line. But SpongeBob uses all his strength to pull himself forward.]
SpongeBob: Not so fast. [grabs the line and ties it to the table]
[SpongeBob takes the line and tangles it up around every table. SpongeBob jumps through the window and pulls the fishing line forward. The Fisherman gets pulled into the kitchen and is dumped into the fryer.]
SpongeBob: Well, looks like the hook is on the other fin now, huh?
[The Fisherman is deep fried into a fish stick. SpongeBob comes out with the Fisherman completely fried to a crisp.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, my friends. I have captured the evil doer.
Creepy sea creatures: Hey, leave him alone! [yelling]
Squidabeth: Just what do you think you're doing?
SpongeBob: Uh, catching a criminal.
Squidabeth: He's no criminal. He works here.
[The Fisherman grumbles at SpongeBob.]
Creature #1: He robs us every night.
Creature #2: [hatches from an egg] It's a night shift tradition.
SpongeBob: [nervously] Oh, a night shift tradition. [clears throat] Heh, heh, oops. Sorry about that, Mr. Fisherman, sir. [sets the Fisherman down and tears the fried coating off him]
Fisherman: No worries, little yellow thing. [winks] You got some mean fishing skills. Respect.
SpongeBob: Oh. [giggles] You're not so bad yourself. [fist bumps the Fisherman's hook]
Fisherman: [grabs SpongeBob and holds him up] Attention, let's welcome our newest member of the night shift. [whispers] What's your name again?
SpongeBob: [whispers] SpongeBob SquarePants.
Fisherman: SquareBob SpongePants!
SpongeBob: Okay, close enough.
Fisherman: [holds up a pile of money] A round of Night Patties for everyone! I'm buying!
[All of the creepy creatures cheer. The scene changes to the foghorn sounding off at dawn. The Krusty Krab night shift sign turns off.]
Squidabeth: Quittin' time!
SpongeBob: Oh, already? [takes off his hat and puts it on the coat rack]
[Squidabeth and the Fisherman put their apron and fishing pole on the coat rack as well.]
Barry Blobfish: [comes back with a cast around his arm] I'm back!
SpongeBob: Barry!
Barry Blobfish: Thanks for helping out, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, it was nothing. [he gets in a group hug with the Fisherman, Squidabeth, and Barry Blobfish] Oh, I'm gonna miss you guys.
[Nosferatu joins in the group hug and everyone laughs.]
Squidabeth: Come and visit us again soon, honey.
Fisherman: We're here every night.
[Squidabeth, Barry Blobfish, Nosferatu, and the Fisherman exit the restaurant and disappear in a misty fog. Moments later, Mr. Krabs appears.]
SpongeBob: [confused] Huh, huh, huh? [rubs his eyes]
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing here so early, boy-o?
SpongeBob: Oh, I was helping out on the night shift.
Mr. Krabs: Night shift, hmm? We don't have a night shift. Hmm, [pats SpongeBob's head] must have been a bad dream, kiddo.
SpongeBob: Huh? Gee, guess I must have been sleep-working.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I ain't sleep-paying you. So, get to wakey-working! [goes into his office]
SpongeBob: Yes, sir. [sighs as he sits on a chair and gets poked by something] Yow! [howls in pain and sees a fish hook in his buttocks] A fish hook?
[The entire scene changes into a spiraling hypnosis screen.]
French Narrator: Case history of a fry cook who wanted a late night snack but ended up in the fry vat of doubt. [Barry Blobfish, Squidabeth, and Nosferatu fly through the void] Mr. SquarePants will never know he has worked a shift in ""The Tidal Zone.""
[The engine and its night train run through ""The Tidal Zone"" and Patrick is riding in it. It turns out that all of the characters that SpongeBob met during the Krusty Krab's supposed night shift are just illusions created by ""The Tidal Zone."" Even Patrick, who supposedly likes the night shift, is an illusion too. Meaning that the Patrick that SpongeBob was with was not the real Patrick.]
Patrick: I'd like five Night Patties to go, please.

This prompts the three of them to prank the two.They first prank Plankton into thinking Mr. Krabs is giving him the formula by using a disguise. When Plankton is fooled, he goes to the Krusty Krab to obtain the formula. However, this causes an alarm at the Krusty Krab to sound off and the real Mr. Krabs arrives at the restaurant.

However, since he loves pranks, he puts the headset back on and continues to ""drive,"" but in midair. The girls turn into amoebas to relax, only for SpongeBob, Plankton and Mr. Krabs to arrive.

[Sandy jumps off her table, takes a vial and pours it on a speck, which forms into a telephone. Sandy dials the number and calls Karen at the Chum Bucket.]

Sandy: [pushes the screen to make room] Karen, my Mainframe! I just made a scientific breakthrough. Let's go and celebrate, girl!
Karen: I'm sorry, Sandy. I can't hear you because [turns to Plankton] someone can't shut up!

Sandy: That's okay, Karen. I'll tell you all about it later. Let's meet up tonight at the corner café!
Karen: You got it, Bushy Tushy. I will definitely be there. [Sandy hangs up the phone] Okay, I'm off.

Mrs. Puff: Was it crazier than this? [imitating SpongeBob] ""Tell her I said 'Hi!'"" ""Tell her I said 'Hi!'"" [mimics SpongeBob's laugh and falls over]
Sandy: Sorry you day was tough, Puff. But my news will cheer your head off. I lived as a microscopic organism for a whole week!
Karen: That's great, Sandy, but I've lived with a microscopic organism for 26 years and wait until you hear what that pipsqueak did today.

Doesn't even ask if my wheel's okay. [picks up her wheels to show that one of them is broken]
Mrs. Puff: [gets up] SpongeBob is the same way, Karen. After all these years of my trying to teach him how to drive, he doesn't know the first thing about a car! [pounds on the table] I'm going crazy!
[Both Karen and Mrs. Puff cry their tears off. Karen’s screen visualizes a scenic waterfall, with her tears running down in real time from where the waterfall is on screen]

Sandy: You bet your sweet software it will. Now let's get pranking.

Plankton: What? How do I know this isn't a trap-erer? Ah! You got me doing it!
Karen: [imitating Mr. Krabs via microphone] It's a going away gift-erer.

Karen: [imitating Mr. Krabs via microphone] I'll get me formuler-er out of me safe-er-er-er and meet you at the Krusty Krab-er-er-er.
[Plankton's thought cloud shows Mr. Krabs giving Plankton the secret formula.]
Plankton: I'll meet you there, Eugene honey! [blow kisses] Kiss! [giggles]
Sandy: I think he bought it.
Karen: Psst! Come on!
Sandy and Mrs. Puff: Whoa-whoa! Wa-whoa! Whoa! [fall in the dumpster]
[Plankton comes out of the Chum Bucket, humming happily. Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen giggle as Plankton enters the Krusty Krab.]

Mr. Krabs: Plankton! You've interrupted me beauty sleep!
Plankton: Hey, Eugene. I'll just take the secret formuler-erer heh and be on my way.
Mr. Krabs: [pulls out a cannon] Over my dead body!

Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen: Gal pals!
[Mr. Krabs blasts Plankton out of the Krusty Krab and sends him flying off into the distance. The scene changes to Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen outside of SpongeBob's house.]
Mrs. Puff: I'm not so sure about pranking SpongeBob. He can't help he's insufferable.
Sandy: Nobody likes a good prank more than SpongeBob.
Mrs. Puff: Mm. Okay.
[Mrs. Puff takes out a ruler and unlocks the door. Sandy and Mrs. Puff sneak into SpongeBob's house while Karen stand outside as a look-out. Sandy and Mrs. Puff come back out with SpongeBob sleep on his bed's mattress. SpongeBob slides off the mattress and continues sleeping. Sandy then quietly slips a helmet on his head.]
Sandy: Virtual reality helmet, engaged.
[SpongeBob murmurs in his sleep and the girls laugh at him.]
Sandy: Shh, shh. All right, Karen. You're up.
[Karen turns on her screen and makes the sound of a doorbell ringing.]
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Huh? C-coming!
[SpongeBob sees through the virtual reality helmet as sees his house. He walks up to Sandy and turns her as if he's opening the door. Then he sees Mrs. Puff as Norton.]
SpongeBob: Hello? Can I help you?
Mrs. Puff: [via Norton] Hello, Mr. SpongeBob. I'm just here to deliver your driver's license. [gives SpongeBob a card in order to fool him into thinking it's his driver's license] Congratulations.
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, thanks— [gasps] My driver's license! [his ""license"" winks at him]
Mrs. Puff: [via Norton] And your new boat! [shows SpongeBob a shopping in order to fool him into thinking it's his boatmobile]
SpongeBob: My new boat! [jumps in his shopping cart] Whoa, wow! [mutters excitedly] Am I dreaming? [sees flying pineapples and a Pteranodon through the helmet] Nope, it's for real. [Sandy and Mrs. Puff shake the shopping cart to fool SpongeBob into thinking he's driving; Through the helmet, he sees bystanders waving at him. Including a talking banana] Look at me, everyone!

Sandy: Whoa, girl! Easy there. Maybe it's about time we let SpongeBob in on the joke.
Mrs. Puff: [punches herself and calmly regains her sanity] Okay. I'll tell him. SpongeBob— [notices SpongeBob driving away] SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob laughs as he drives away in the shopping cart. Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen scream and chase after SpongeBob. SpongeBob runs over a rock, spins and continues to drive. Sandy and Mrs. Puff ride onto Karen.]
Mrs. Puff: Poor little guy! This is all my fault!
Sandy: No, Puff! This is all my fault!
Karen: [her screen shows ""Gal Pals"" on it] Gal pals!
Sandy: Not now, Karen!
Karen: Sorry.
SpongeBob: [laughs and sees a crowd cheering for him through the helmet] Ooh, a turn. Better use my hand signals.
Sandy: SpongeBob! Look out!
[SpongeBob grabs onto a one way sign and swings the shopping cart the other direction. Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen continue to follow him. As SpongeBob drives the shopping cart, he causes a major pile up on the road.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Hi, I'm driving. Hi, I'm driving. Hi, I'm driving! [laughs and waves the card around] Look, I got a license. [two boats collide and Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff emerge from the smoke; SpongeBob giggles] Whoo! Nothing but me and miles of road! [giggles as he is ending to a brick wall near a construction site]
Sandy: We gotta stop this cart, gal pals!

Mrs. Puff: Whoa! Whoa! [sees the brick wall saying the words, ""Dead End""] I'll save you, SpongeBob!

I love pranks! [laughs] Thank you, thank you, thank you! You gave me a chance to live my driving dream. And most importantly... [hugs Mrs. Puff] Mrs. Puff saved my life! Now I will stay by your side forever! [laughs]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, no! No!
[SpongeBob flies around Mrs. Puff. Sandy grabs Mrs. Puff and the hop back onto Karen. They all run away from SpongeBob.]

[SpongeBob slips into Amy and accidentally pops her.]
Bubble Groom: Aw. [begins to sulk, but SpongeBob slips into him and accidentally pops him]
[The bubble ring pops in mid-air. SpongeBob skids out of control and accidentally pops a line of bubble ducklings and a bubble duck. When he pops the mummy duck, the bubble soap lands on and covers the screen. He then pops some of the bubble buildings in Bubbletown. The scene changes to the bubble mayor giving a grand opening to a new bubble elementary school for bubble children.]
Bubble mayor: I now dedicate this new school for overly cute children.
[The bubble crowd cheers.]
Adorable bubble child: I wuv to learn!
[SpongeBob screams as he continue to slip on the suds. Just as the bubble mayor was about to cut the bubble ribbon, SpongeBob slips past him and pops it.]
Bubble mayor: Hey! That was my job! [gets accidentally popped by SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: I'm so sorry! I can't stop!
[SpongeBob accidentally pops the adorable bubble child with his shoe, causing the bubble crowd to gasp.]
SpongeBob: [slow-motion] Watch out! [accidentally pops the bubble crowd and the new bubble elementary school]
[SpongeBob continues to skid out of control.]
Bubble Buddy: SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob slips into the Bubbletown's bubble sign, bumps into a rock and lands near the shore. He lays flat on his face and cries.]
Bubble Buddy: SpongeBob! Oh thank goodness, you're okay.
SpongeBob: [gets up] No! Stay away! [shows his face covered in sand, shells, and sticks] I'm a monster! [whimpers] A monster! [Bubble Buddy gasps] Just look at the destruction I hath wrought!
[Bubbletown is now a complete mess from the destruction SpongeBob accidentally caused.]
Bubble Fred: My bubble legs!
Bubble Man #4: [his bubble monster truck's tires pop] My monster truck tires! [his bubble monster truck pops]
Bubble Buddy: Okay, that doesn't look great. [uneasy chuckle] But I'm sure we can get it all sorted out.
[A bubble police car arrives and pops, revealing a bubble police officer.]
Bubble police officer: I'm afraid the only sorting out your friend's going to be doing is in jail. For popping a large portion of the city.
SpongeBob: Okay, take me away! I'm guilty! I deserve whatever punishment you give me.
[The bubble police officer handcuffs him with bubble handcuffs. The scene changes to Bubbletown Prison. The bubble police officer gives SpongeBob the bubble telephone.]
Bubble police officer: All right, you get one phone call.
SpongeBob: Okay. [dials the number on the bubble telephone; the line thrills and a recorded voice is going] The machine, hold on. Gotta leave a message. One second. [the bubble telephone beeps; as he talks through the bubble telephone, it forms into a big bubble] Hey, Mr. Krabs. It's me, SpongeBob. Um, I'm in jail. In Bubbletown. They gave me three life sentences, so um...so um... [sniffs] I might be late for my next shift! I'm so sorry! [pushes the bubble message out the bubble window of Bubbletown Prison and cries]
French Narrator: Later…
[Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs comes out from his office and is shocked to see a long line of starving customers, some of which are dead. Squidward is sleeping on the cash register.]
Mr. Krabs: [yells loudly in Squidward's face] Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: [pulls his hat off to straighten out his face] Du, huh, what, who?
Mr. Krabs: What's going on here? How long have these folks been waiting to give me their money?
[Old Man Jenkins passes out and dies. His angel begins to exit his body, but he grabs it and stuffs it back in.]
Old Man Jenkins: I'm okay!
Mr. Krabs: Well…?
Squidward: What's the point? There's no one in the kitchen to make any food.
Mr. Krabs: [peaks into the kitchen and looks around; talks high-pitched] What?! Where's SpongeBob? Didn't he call in?
[Just then, SpongeBob's bubble message floats in and an image of SpongeBob appears on it as it breaks air.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs. It's me, SpongeBob. Um, I'm in jail. In Bubbletown. They gave me— [Mr. Krabs pops the bubble message before it finishes]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, barnacles. Me fry cook's in the clink. You have the conn, Mr. Squidward. I'll be back as soon as I can! [runs out to go rescue SpongeBob from Bubbletown Prison]
Customers: Wha—whoa. [fall over like domino blocks]
[Back at Bubbletown Prison, SpongeBob is lifting weights with some bubble prisoners. All of a sudden, Mr. Krabs appears and pops Bubbletown Prison wall, which resulted in freeing some bubble prisoners including the Dirty Bubble.]
SpongeBob: [hugs Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [pulls SpongeBob off] This is a prison break, boy-o. Let's get a move on! We've got a bunch of hungry customers back home, and I need your help fleecing—I mean, I mean feeding them!
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I can't go. I haven't finished paying my debt to society yet.
Mr. Krabs: [stammers] Can't go? When I say we're leaving, we're leaving!
Bubble police officer: Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!
Mr. Krabs: Eat claw, bubble cop!
[Mr. Krabs clamps his claws and spins around and around like a helicopter.]
Bubble police officer: Uh-huh?
[Mr. Krabs flies over towards to bubble police officer and chases him in the Bubbletown Prison. Mr. Krabs' sharp claws proceeds to pops everything into Bubbletown Prison and completely destroys it. He then destroys a bubble house's roof.]
Bubble Wife: Honey!
[Mr. Krabs spins uncontrollably and continuously pops all of Bubbletown until everything is nothing more than puddles of suds. The last thing he pops is a small bubble duckling, which he falls on top off.]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] Good thing they were all just bubbles, eh? Okay, let's get out of here. [pulls off SpongeBob's face by accident] Uh-oh. [pastes it back on him]
SpongeBob: [falls to the ground in complete shock] You popped it all. [his eyes tear up] There's nothing left!
Mr. Krabs: Forget it, SpongeBob. It's Bubbletown.
SpongeBob: No! I can't forget it. Just leave me here, Mr. Krabs. My tears will be a fitting memorial to the bubble city that I loved. [his tears form a replica of Bubbletown on the ground as he sobs]
Bubble Buddy: [shows up with a big bottle of soap] So sorry to interrupt, but I might have a solution that works for everyone!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Oh, yeah!
Bubble Buddy: Yeah!
SpongeBob: [pops out a variety of bubble wands] Let's blow this popsicle stand. [laughs]
[The scene changes to newly blow Bubbletown. Bubbletown now has a new location that looks almost similar to the Krusty Krab in Bikini Bottom. It is known as the Bubbly Krab. The bubble groom drives away with Amy, his newly wedded bubble wife. In the Bubbly Krab, SpongeBob is wearing a bubble hat similar to the hat he wears at the Krusty Krab and is holding a bubble spatula.]
Bubble Buddy: I can't believe how quickly you inflated the whole city again, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yep! The whole city. Plus this new Krusty Krab. [shows all the bubble customers eating Bubble Patties]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs as he is counting bubble money in the Bubbly Krab cash register] Yeah! Franchisin's a great idea, boy-o! [opens the bubble cash register and pops out bubble money] I am making money claw over fist here. [stuffs the bubble money in the bubble cash register] Hey, what's the exchange rate for bubbles to real money?
Bubble Buddy: There is none! [laughs along with SpongeBob]
[All the bubble customers laugh as well.]
Bubble customers: Exchange rate? [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: That's it. We're done here. [pops the Bubbly Krab, picks up SpongeBob, and leaves Bubbletown in disgust]
SpongeBob: Huh. [giggles]

Mr. Krabs: Stop, thief! Come back here with me formula!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are chasing Plankton with the secret formula all over the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: He's over there! Stop him!
Plankton: [laughs] I can't help it. I'm a kleptomaniac!
[Mr. Krabs nearly catches him, but Plankton dodges him. Plankton keeps running away with the formula until he bumps into someone.]
Plankton: [laughs] Ow!
[Plankton pulls himself off, accidentally losing his eyeball and teeth. He puts his eyeball back in his face, looks up and sees a female police officer.]
Police Officer: You're under arrest!
Plankton: [puts his teeth back in his mouth] But I'm innocent!
Police Officer: No one is innocent! [cuffs up Plankton]
Plankton: Whoa. Things got dark fast.
Mr. Krabs: [giggles] ♪You're going to jail! You're going to jail!♪ Join in the dancing, boy, or you're fired. [SpongeBob joins in the dancing] ♪You're going to jail! You're going to jail! You're going to jail! You're going to jail!♪ [pokes Plankton]
Police Officer: Step back, buddy! Let the law handle this. [whacks Mr. Krabs' head with her club, inadvertently causing him to drop the secret formula]
Mr. Krabs: [dizzy] Yes, officer.
Police Officer: [takes the formula before Plankton can get it] And I'll be taking this!
Mr. Krabs: Wait! That's me secret formula!
Police Officer: [whacks Mr. Krabs' head with her club again] Well, now it's evidence. [picks up Plankton as he tries to get the formula] Oh.
Plankton: [gets whacked in the head by the officer] Ow!
[The police officer leaves the restaurant with Plankton and the secret formula.]
SpongeBob: But the formula! I can't cook without that formula! [hyperventilates] I can't don't anything without it! The Krabby Patties are gonna taste like ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chum!
[The customers grumble and leave the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! Don't go! We still have fresh buns. And we have air conditioning. Ohh... Come here! You and me are getting into that police department to get that formula back!
SpongeBob: How?
[Mr. Krabs puts on a police officer outfit.]
Mr. Krabs: By dressing like the po-po.
SpongeBob: The po-po? Oh, no, no.
Mr. Krabs: [removes SpongeBob's hat with the club] No, no po-po—no job-o for you-o. Comprendo?
SpongeBob: So-so. [gulps] But I'll go-go.
[Meanwhile, at the Bikini Bottom Police Department, Plankton is randomly getting pictures taken.]
Police Officer: Turn to your left. [takes picture and shows a mug]
Plankton: What is this?
Police Officer: Mug shot.
Plankton: [scoffs] Looks nothing like me. [gets drenched by the mug's coffee]
[The scene changes to the officer letting Plankton into his cell.]
Police Officer: [slams the door] Low life.
Plankton: You'd live a low life too, officer, if you were my height! [sighs and goes to sleep in his bed; he goes to tuck himself in, but sees that his blanket is a postage stamp] Could have given me a bigger blanket!
[The police officer put on donut-earmuffs so she wouldn't hear Plankton's complaining. Patrick comes in all covered in ice cream and looking drunk. Patrick kicks the camera stand and falls.]
Police Officer: One too many Goofy Goobers again, eh, Patrick?
Patrick: [gets up and groans] No, sir, I couldn't eat another.
[Patrick drunkenly stumbles over to Plankton's cell.]
Police Officer: Get in there and sleep it off.
[Patrick pulls the key out from his belly button and enters the cell. Patrick walks over to the toilet, runs over to Plankton and falls onto the bed to sleep. He turns his body over, revealing Plankton in his butt area.]
Plankton: Not exactly the blanket I wanted.
[Meanwhile in Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are wondering around the streets in their police uniforms.]
SpongeBob: Isn't it a crime to impersonate a police officer?
Mr. Krabs: We're not impersonating, boy-o. I was in the navy, and the navy is sort of like the cops...of the sea. And I just deputized you. [whacks SpongeBob with the club]
SpongeBob: Deput—wow! I always wanted to be an officer of the law! Check it out. [rubs his chin] I'm the fuzz. Ooh, look at this! [takes off his shoe and his foot is flat] I'm also a flat foot! [giggles] Watch me work. [runs over to a passing mime and blows the whistle] Mr. Mime, you have the right to remain silent . [giggles and runs over to an old man] Stop or I'll shoot...you a nasty look. [makes faces, blows a raspberry, and giggles]
[SpongeBob starts holding hands with Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [pulls his hand away] Hey, let go! Cops don't hold hands.
SpongeBob: Well...they should. [droops]
Mr. Krabs: Bring it in, Officer Little Buddy!
[SpongeBob gets excited and hugs Mr. Krabs. Just then, a crowd of people is watching them.]
Mr. Krabs: What? Cops can hug. You know, boy-o, we probably make some pretty good cops.
[SpongeBob notices a little girl selling cookies at her cookie stand. He begins to grow suspicious.]
SpongeBob: Hm? Ohh. What have we got here? Excuse me, miss. Have you got a license to sell these cookies?
Mr. Krabs: Officer SquarePants, I don't think we ought to—
SpongeBob: Let me handle this, Officer Mr. Krabs! Well, missy, do ya?
Helen the Felon: I don't have a license.
SpongeBob: [cuffs the little girl] Yeah, that's what I thought. You're under arrest for violating penal code 49689763025-D.
Mr. Krabs: How did you know that?
SpongeBob: That's classified.
[Back in the Bikini Bottom Police Department, Patrick is having a conversation with Plankton in their prison cell.]
Patrick: Oh, I love it here. We have owers, uh, a courtyard, and three square meals a day. [holds up a bucket of raw chum] All chum...Ahh.
Plankton: I know. They're my only customer.
Patrick: [laughs and runs to the toilet] This is the best part! [flushes the toilet and it sprits out a fountain of water; he laughs] Pretty cool, huh?
Plankton: If you attempt to use that in front of me, I'll annihilate you.
[Outside the police department, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs bring the little girl to the front door.]
SpongeBob: Central booking, also known as the cop shop. [opens the door and lets the little girl go in]
Mr. Krabs: How do you know all these words?
SpongeBob: Still classified. [enters the building and Mr. Krabs follows]
Officer John Slugfish: Well, if it isn't little Helen the Felon. [drinks some coffee] Good work, boys. You nabbed the most notorious criminal in Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: Huh? This sweet little thing?
Officer John Slugfish: You can drop the act now, Helen.
[Helen bites SpongeBob's hand and kick's Mr. Krabs in the stomach.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey!
Officer John Slugfish: [chuckles] That's my girl. All right, take her to the interrogation room.
[Helen the Felon is taken to the interrogation room and SpongeBob turns on the light.]
Mr. Krabs: While I look for the formula, you can interrogate the suspect.
SpongeBob: But I don't know how to interrogate.
Mr. Krabs: Then just ask questions. [pushes SpongeBob in the room] And act tough. [leaves]
SpongeBob: Um...questions and act tough. Got it. [goes to the table and pulls the chair] Hmm... [sits down] Okay, little Helen! [inhales and buffs up his body] What do you think of this weather?
Helen the Felon: I think it's wuh-vey! Let me ask you something. How long have you been an idiot?
[SpongeBob begins to get nervous and shrinks down to his normal size.]
SpongeBob: I want a lawyer.
Helen the Felon: Just answer the question!
[SpongeBob's body rips in half, revealing his brain. SpongeBob takes his brain back and becomes even more nervous than usual.]
SpongeBob: [whimpers] An idiot? I don't know! Is it hot in here? [breathes heavily and sweats] Pressure—I can't—okay, I'll confess! I'll confess to it all! Anything! Whatever you got!
[Back at Plankton's prison cell, Plankton is sawing his way out with the nail filer. Patrick sighs behind him.]
Plankton: That's it. Keep up that cacophony. Your noise is drowning out my filing. [chuckles]
Patrick: [groans] My stomach needs frozen treats.
Patrick's stomach: Frozen treats.
Patrick: [jumps off the bed] Huh! I'm gonna have to make myself some jailhouse ice cream. [puts a band on his hand]
[Patrick grabs a bunch of toilet paper and stuffs them down the toilet. He pulls his underwear out and stuffs it in the toilet too. He squirts a tube of toothpaste, adds a cinderblock, and stuffs them all down with his foot. He grabs a scooper, scoops some green ice cream out and puts it on a cone made out of magazine. He takes a taste and he likes it.]
Patrick: Try it! You can't even tell the difference.
[A close-up of the ice cream is shown.]
Plankton: Blech! No, thanks. But, say, I know where they keep the real ice cream around here: in the evidence room. A guy like you who knows his way around here might be able—
Patrick: [pops a key out from the ice cream] I have a key.
Plankton: Oh, really? Let's go!
[Patrick swallows the key, rubs the ice cream all over his body and slips through the bars. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is searching through the hallway for the evidence room. He stumbles across a room filled with donuts.]
Mr. Krabs: Donuts? [opens the door and a pile of donuts fall on him] Whoa! [pops out] Hm. Well...maybe just one. [eats one donut; he turns and sees the door to the evidence room and spits the donut out] Evidence room! [goes to the door] Huh? [hears something]
Patrick: You promised me ice cream! Hmph! [sits on the floor and pouts]
Plankton: [jumps on Patrick's stomach] Look, once I get the secret formula and rule the world, I'll buy you all the ice cream you want! [hops over to a shelf filled with various evidence] Let's see. Comic books, sea shells...an old man...
Old Man Walker: [to the viewer] Hello!
Plankton: Outboard motors...stolen jokes...a leg...
Fred: [off-screen] My leg!
Plankton: Hmm? Well, drop a dime on me! There it is! [goes to get the formula, but Mr. Krabs takes it before it gets it]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, you don't!
Plankton: Krabs? What are you doing here? I stole that formula fair and square!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'm stealing it back! [stuffs the formula under his shirt]
Plankton: Oh, no, you not!
[Plankton throws a sea shell at Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs removes the shell and falls over, knocking over boxes of evidence. He comes out, holding an old man.]
Old Man Walker: Hello!
[Mr. Krabs throws the old man at Plankton, squishing him in the wall.]
Old Man Walker: Hello!
[Plankton throws the old man back at Mr. Krabs, sending him flying into another shelf. A group of old people fall onto Mr. Krabs.]
Old people: Hello!
Mr. Krabs: Who's been pinching all these geezers?
Patrick: [grabs Mr. Krabs] Where's my ice cream? Where's my ice cream? Where— [hallucinates as he sees Mr. Krabs' eyestalks become two ice cream cones; he gasps] Ohh! Well, there it is. [licks Mr. Krabs' eyestalk]
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing, you maniac?! Help! Police! [screams as he runs]
[Plankton jumps onto Mr. Krabs and begins a brawl.]
Mr. Krabs: What do you think you're—
[Moments later, Officer John Slugfish comes in the evidence room, eating a donut. He sees Plankton, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick fighting.]
Officer John Slugfish: I don't know what you two are doing, but it looks illegal. [gets caught in the brawl, but manages to cuff them all up]
SpongeBob: [comes in wearing cuffs] I have a confession to make!
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob being placed in the same cell with Plankton and Helen the Felon.]
Officer John Slugfish: I'll just hold onto this formula till the morning. [shuts the cell door]
SpongeBob: Oh, but, officer, I have more confessions.
Officer John Slugfish: Zip it, kid! I get it. You're a criminal mastermind. [leaves]
SpongeBob: Guilty! Yay!
Plankton: Hey, where's Patrick?
[They see Patrick, covered in ice cream again, all drunk from Goofy Goobers and opens the cell door with the key. Patrick walks over to the toilet, runs over to Plankton, Helen the Felon, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob and falls onto the bed to sleep.]

He thinks someone is talking to him, and when he tells this to SpongeBob, he says that the voice is probably his conscience.Plankton tells Patrick that he is his conscience and that he needs him to buy more Krabby Patties, but Patrick has to do some errands before doing so. After a while of doing these errands, Plankton gets annoyed and crosses out all the errands on Patrick's list and adds one to give Plankton the formula.When the two go to the Chum Bucket, Plankton tells Patrick to toss the patty into the mail slot, but he accidentally throws it too hard and makes it land on a boat with Pearl and her friends. This forces the two to go to Goo Lagoon and go inside Pearl to get the formula. When they go inside Pearl, a man named Geppetto has the Krabby Patty.

The book opens and the screens zooms into the picture of Karen in a beautiful fairy outfit holding her wand. She is seen standing outside of Bikini Bottom at night.]
Karen: [to the viewers] Greetings, children of Bikini Bottom. I am Karen the Computer Fairy. [waves her wand and a scallop flies on her hand; she sings really loud, which causes the scallop to shatter into bits, acting like glass.] And I have a magic tale to tell. [waves her wand and a picture of Patrick appears on her screen] Once upon a time, there was a dim-witted sea star [Patrick appears in a puppet outfit and looks a lot like the character, Pinocchio] who was about to stuff his fat face. [waves her wand with the word ""Magics"" fly by; her screen shows the Krusty Krab]
[At the Krusty Krab, Patrick comes out through the doors with a plate full of Krabby Patties. He takes a seat on a table and goes to eat his meal. Little did Patrick know, Plankton was observing him through a magnifying glass about his restaurant.]
Plankton: Hee, hee, hee. That idiot has such a huge pile of patties. I don't think he'll notice if one walks away. [laughs]
[Patrick continues to eat his lunch. Plankton flies into the patties and peaks out.]
Patrick: Aw, I need more ketchup. [hops out of his chair and runs back in for ketchup]
Plankton: Hmm… which patty to choose? This one? Nope. Too small. [throws away small patty] This one? Nope. Been chewed. [throws away chewed patty] This one? Nope. The seeds are missing. Hmm...
[Suddenly, the sun shines bright through Plankton's magnifying glass and burns him. Plankton screams and his body is on fire. Patrick comes out with a ketchup bottle and sits on top of Plankton.]
Plankton: Ow! Stand up, you moron!
[Patrick squeezes the ketchup bottle too hard and ketchup explodes everywhere. The ketchup flies in Patrick's eyes. Patrick panics and knocks over the table and the patties.]
Plankton: Get me an ice pack, you idiot!
Patrick: Where are you, Voice? [stretches his face and his eyes stretch out] Where are you? [sees SpongeBob, who is coming out of the restaurant]
SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick?
Patrick: [screams and his eyes pull back into his face] Oh, it's you, SpongeBob. I thought you were this crazy voice who keeps telling me what to do.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's probably your conscience.
Patrick: What are conscience? Are they bad?
SpongeBob: No. A conscience is a tiny voice inside you that tells you the difference between something that's right and something [gives Patrick a wedgie] that's wrong.
Patrick: So, I should do what the voice tells me to do?
SpongeBob: [pats Patrick's head] Now that's a smart little sea star. [leaves]
[Patrick giggles and gulps down the plate full of patties. Plankton grins and gets an idea. He decides to take advantage of the opportunity by posing himself as Patrick's conscience so he'll get a Krabby Patty and now the formula. Plankton peels himself off of Patrick's butt and runs off. Patrick sips down some soda just as Plankton climbs up his shoulder in conscience disguise, which is the similar clothing to the character, Jiminy Cricket.]
Plankton: Patrick, this is your conscience speaking.
Patrick: Huh? [sees Plankton on his shoulder] Oh. [bows and drops Plankton in his soda] Nice to meet you, Conscience.
Plankton: [comes out of the soda] So stupid. So, Stupid, the first thing you need to do is buy some more Krabby Patties on the double. Hi-yah! Hey-yo!
Patrick: That'll be the first thing I do, Conscience!
Plankton: Yes!
Patrick: Right after I run some errands.
[Patrick pulls out a to-do list from his fupa and reads it.]
Plankton: Huh? [flings himself out of the cup] No! [kicks the soda] I'm calling the shots here. Now, get that Krabby Patty!
Patrick: I—I—It's just a little list! Please, Conscience?
Plankton: Alright, Pea-Brain. Make it quick.
Patrick: Number 1: High-five everyone! [waves his arm around with Plankton like he's playing a guitar] Huh!
Plankton: No, put me down first!
Patrick: High-five! [high-fives a civilian with Plankton in his hand] High-five! [high-fives another] Low-five! [low-fives a civilian] High-five! [high-fives SpongeBob] High-five! [high-fives a tough guy] High-five! [high-fives another] High-five! [high-fives another] High-five! [high-fives a realistic hand that punches Plankton]
[Plankton is squished and beaten up by the high-fives each person gave to Patrick. He liquifies into a puddle. Patrick slips on Plankton and falls on his face. Patrick giggles. Karen waves her wand to the next scene. The scene changes to Goofy Goober's Ice Cream Party Boat. The kids are in there eating ice cream sundaes and Goober meals. The mascot, Goofy Goober is greeting a little girl with a bowl of ice cream. Patrick and Plankton go up to the counter.]
Patrick: Number 2: Ice cream! Yeah! [waves his arm around with Plankton again and does his victory screech] One double chocolate molar blowout, please.
Goofy Goober waiter: One molar blowout, coming up!
Plankton: No! [pulls Patrick's tongue] You hate ice cream. You only want Krabby Patties. [hops into the soft serve ice cream machine] Hey you! Cancel that order!
[The Goofy Goober waiter pulls down the lever and swirls Plankton into a soft serve ice cream cone. He gives the cone to Patrick. Patrick begins to eat Plankton. Plankton bites Patrick's tongue.]
Patrick: [yells in pain] Ow. You hate high-fives and ice cream? Are you sure you're my conscience? [looks at Plankton]
Plankton: I, uh, I'm absolutely positively your conscience. [his nose grows into Patrick's eye]
Patrick: Hey, doesn't your nose grow when you tell lies in fairy tales?
Plankton: Nope. Noses only grow when you make up the truth. [his nose grows longer] See?
Patrick: Ah-ha-ha! Oh, oh, I wanna make up the truth, too! Uh, I ate a hot air balloon for breakfast. [nothing happens] I—I—I mean, um, I did not eat a hot air balloon for breakfast. [his nose grows longer] Hey! I got a big nose too! Nose fight! En garde! [hits Plankton with his long nose]
[Patrick and Plankton engage a nose sword fight and the kids cheer. Plankton hits Patrick and makes him knock over a table. The triple gooberberry sunrise sundae flies into the Goofy Goober waiter's face. He is covered in ice cream.]
Children: Uh-oh.
Goofy Goober waiter: Hooray!
[The kids, Goofy Goober, and Patrick cheer. Patrick and Plankton resume their nose sword fight. Plankton pokes Patrick's butt with his nose and sends him rolling towards the counter. Patrick crashes into the counter and splatters ice cream all over the place. The Goofy Goober waiter is covered in ice cream and looks like a snowman.]
Children: Uh-oh.
[The ice cream melts off of the Goofy Goober waiter. He looks down and sees Patrick and Plankton.]
Patrick and Plankton: Sorry.
[The Goofy Goober waiter is really angry and his ice cream cone pupils melt in fury. He kicks Patrick and Plankton out, sending them flying into the street. Patrick and Plankton fall on their noses and they break off.]
Plankton: Time to let your conscience be your guide. Give me that list! [goes into Patrick's fupa, grabs the list, crosses out everything and writes something down] Here! [gives Patrick the list]
Patrick: Hey, only one errand left! [leans back and forth and plays his air guitar] Gotta give Plankton a Krabby Patty! [fireworks explode above him]
Plankton: [shakes his hat off, waves his blond hair and plays his air guitar] Oh, yeah! Yeah!
[The scene changes to Patrick and Plankton arriving at the Chum Bucket with a Krabby Patty.]
Patrick: I wonder why I wanted to give Plankton a patty?
Plankton: Why not Plankton? He's a sweetheart. [his nose grows long and Plankton clips it off] And as your conscience, I demand you toss that patty in the mail slot!
Patrick: Oh, I love mail slot toss! [attempts to throw the patty in the mail slot, but he misses as it bounces upwards]
Plankton: Not so hard! [slaps Patrick] Huh? [sees the patty land on Pearl's picnic basket who is going to the beach with her friends]
Pearl: I've been wanting to hit the beach all week. [laughs]
Pearl and her friends: Goo Lagoon! Goo Lagoon! [drive away to Goo Lagoon]
Plankton: Huh? [his mouth falls in shock; Plankton forms another idea and a lightbulb lights up above his head. He pastes his mouth back on] Ah-ha! Patrick, please promptly pursue Plankton's patty! [points to lightbulb] Get the idea?
Patrick: Uh, uh. [strains himself as a lightbulb appears on his head; but it burns out and Patrick drolls]
[Plankton groans, grabs a ladder, and climbs up to Patrick's head.]
Plankton: How many plankton does it take to change a lightbulb? [unscrews the burnt lightbulb and replaces it with a new one] One. [climbs down, pulls Patrick's tooth and the lightbulb lights]
Patrick: [wakes up] Huh? Now I get the idea! Whoo! [waves his arm around again] Gotta follow that patty!
[Patrick runs off to follow Pearl and her friends to Goo Lagoon. Plankton is trampled by Patrick's feet and gets up.]
Plankton: Wait for me, you pink pinhead! [gets blown away by the wind]
[The scene changes to Goo Lagoon. Pearl lays by to rest in the sun. Patrick and Plankton arrive by digging under the sand. They tunnel past several beach goers along the way. They hit Tyler's beach umbrella. They hit Fred.]
Fred: Ow! Hey, watch it!
[They hit another beach goer who is sipping a drink. Plankton pops out of the sand and spit some of it out. Patrick pops out of the sand and spits out a volley ball. Pearl nearly sucks her umbrella in her mouth while she sleeps.]
Plankton: There's Blubber Mouth.
[Pearl sucks the umbrella in her mouth and swallow it in her sleep.]
Patrick: There's Plankton's patty!
Plankton: You know what to do.
Patrick: Do I? [gets slapped by Plankton] Oh yeah!
[Patrick digs towards Pearl and goes to grab the patty. The patty falls off the picnic roll into Pearl's mouth. Plankton escapes and falls on the sand. But Pearl has swallowed the patty whole.]
Plankton: [groans] Oh, well. No patty for Plankton. [sobs]
Patrick: Huh! I'm going in! Hi-yah! [jumps into Pearl's mouth and goes down her throat]
Plankton: Ugh. Just being near a whale's mouth gives me the creeps. [gets and pulled into Pearl's mouth by Patrick; Patrick and Plankton fall deep down Pearl's throat and Patrick screams until Plankton hits his mouth] Quiet, you fool! You'll wake up Pearl.
[Patrick and Plankton land in Pearl's stomach. Pearl feels a bit of painfulness and goes back to sleep. Patrick gets scared and cowers in fear.]
Patrick: This is snug.
Plankton: Mother always said I'd end up in a whale's belly. Or prison.
Geppetto: Hey! Who-a goes-a there?
Patrick: Who goes where?
Geppetto: [comes out from his tent] The name's-a Geppetto. Take off your hats and stay a while.
Plankton: We don't have time for a visit, old man. We're just trying to find a sandwich.
Geppetto: Sandwich? No, I haven't seen anything like that around-a here in months. [his nose grows]
Patrick: Hey, Geppetto, what's that behind your back?
Plankton: Is that our Krabby Patty?
Geppetto: Nope. [his nose grows longer] Oh! [punches his nose back in his face]
Plankton: [jumps on Geppetto's shoulder and grabs the patty] Ah-ha! I got the patty!
Patrick: [grabs Geppetto's wig] Ah-ha! I got the wig! [puts it on his head]
Geppetto: [goes in his tent] Son, they're-a stealing our food!
[Geppetto pulls out an unfinished wooden puppet he calls Pinocchio.]
Pinocchio: Who's stealing our food, Pop? Let me at 'em! Let me at 'em!
[Patrick and Plankton look at each other in puzzlement.]
Geppetto: Get 'em, Pinocchio!
[Patrick, Plankton, Geppetto, and Pinocchio get into a brawl. Geppetto ties Plankton and Patrick in puppet strings. They brawl again and they all get tangled up in puppet strings. They brawl again and they all play jump rope like children. They stop and resume their brawl. Their fighting causes Pearl to get a horrible taste of indigestion and her stomach growls in pain.]
Pearl: [to the viewers; as she is talking in a commercial parody.] Oh, no. A stomach ache at the beach? That's no fun! I wish it would go away.
[Karen magically appears next to Pearl.]
Karen: Your wish is granted. Hold out your hand! [waves her wand and poof up a bottle of Gush and Flush stomach reliever]
Pearl: Wow! What is this?
Karen: For fast relief of indigestion, try Gush and Flush. And wash your pain down the drain. [whispers] And my stupid husband, while you're at it.
Pearl: [drinks the stomach reliever] Ah.
[Pearl's stomach growls. Patrick, Plankton, Geppetto, and Pinocchio continue to fight until they get caught in a torrent of stomach reliever. Pearl blasts the stomach reliever out from her blowhole, sending Patrick, Plankton, Geppetto, and Pinocchio out of her body.]
Pearl: Thank you, Extra Strength Gush and Flush! [giggles and winks]
Geppetto: Pinocchio, we're-a free-a! Free-a!
[Pinocchio waves his arm around while Geppetto sings his heart out. Suddenly, a giant clam comes out and swallows them both.]
Plankton: Huh? [gets up] Don't worry about the patty, Patrick. I'll take it to Plankton myself, like a good little conscience. [picks up the patty] See ya!
[Plankton goes to return to the Chum Bucket with the patty, but bumps into a small yellow starfish who turns out to be Patrick's real conscience.]
Patrick's conscience: Oh, uh, hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Eh, my conscience?
Plankton: Your wha?
Patrick's conscience: Yep, I'm Patrick's conscience. But I overslept.
Patrick: Well, if you're my conscience conscience, then who's that?
Patrick's conscience: It's a bug! Step on it!
[Patrick rapidly steps on Plankton with his foot.]
Karen: [to the viewers] And they all lived happily ever after. So, until next time, this is—
Plankton: Karen!
Karen: The Computer Fairy hoping all your dreams come true.
[Karen waves her wand and her screen goes back to the storybook. The last page says ""All Your Dreams Come True"" on it. The scene zooms in Karen's screen to go to the storybook.]
Pinocchio: [appears on screen] Let me at 'em, Pop! Let me at 'em! Let me at 'em! Let me—
[The book closes onto Pinocchio and the cover says the title, ""The End"" on it. Then the episode ends shortly after.]

Mr. Krabs orders SpongeBob to guard the front door, while Squidward decides to take a nap. Three hours pass, and Plankton never shows up. SpongeBob passes out from exhaustion and drops his mop on Squidward's face, waking him up. Mr. Krabs questions why Plankton has not shown up yet, and thinks that the door is stuck. He oils the door, while also getting rid of some customers who are blocking his path. When Plankton still does not show up, Mr. Krabs gets an idea. The next scene shows that Mr. Krabs has put the formula out in plain sight with a giant arrow pointing to it. Once the formula disappears, Mr. Krabs assumes it was Plankton who stole it and puts the restaurant on lockdown. SpongeBob starts to block off all the exits, until everyone realizes that Patrick actually had the secret formula bottle, thinking it was ketchup. It is now the end of the day, and SpongeBob and Squidward are about to go home, but Mr. Krabs stops them, fearing that Plankton is still up to something. SpongeBob and Squidward leave the Krusty Krab anyway, while Mr. Krabs stays in the restaurant overnight.The next morning, SpongeBob and Squidward arrive for work and assume that Mr. Krabs eventually went to his house. They are proven wrong however, when Mr. Krabs reveals himself, camouflaged into the floor like a chameleon. In the next scene, a customer is about to order something off of the menu, but Mr. Krabs attacks the customer, thinking he is Plankton wearing a disguise. The customer angrily leaves the restaurant, saying he will never set foot in the establishment again. Just then, Mr. Krabs notices Mrs. Puff is about to leave with a Krabby Patty, but Mr. Krabs yanks her back with a hook, suspecting her to be sneaking a Patty off to Plankton. Mrs. Puff denies this, saying that it was just a to-go order, but Mr. Krabs does not believe her. Squidward sarcastically asks if Mr. Krabs will ban pockets, to which he actually does. He uses a reef blower to suck up all of the customer's clothes and puts them in barrels. Mr. Krabs then stops Old Man Walker from leaving the Krusty Krab, as he notices that he is hiding Krabby Patties under his hat. Old Man Walker exclaims that he just wanted some for later, but Mr. Krabs does not believe him, and bans him from the restaurant. Mr. Krabs also bans a baby and its mother from the restaurant when he suspects that they are working for Plankton. Slowly losing his mind, Mr. Krabs starts banning people from the restaurant left and right, until there are no customers left. Mr. Krabs then starts boarding up the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob worries, stating that he does not think Plankton will be coming. Just then, they hear a knocking at the door, and hear a voice asking for a Krabby Patty. It is just Sandy though, but Mr. Krabs thinks she is Plankton wearing a squirrel disguise, and bans her from the restaurant too. Mr. Krabs starts to go completely insane, walking on the ceiling and foaming at the mouth. SpongeBob questions Mr. Krabs' behavior and whispers to Squidward that maybe they should postpone their ""plans"" they had for that night. Mr. Krabs overhears this, and thinks that SpongeBob and Squidward are both working for Plankton, banning both of his employees from the Krusty Krab.Later that night, Mr. Krabs is shown to have completely lost it. He has the restaurant boarded up, booby traps set up everywhere, and is hiding under the register boat with the formula tied to his neck while sweating uncontrollably. Just then, Mr. Krabs thinks he hears Plankton's voice, but it turns out to be a Chum Bucket ad on the Krusty Krab's TV. He turns the TV off, only to see a shadow on the wall that he thinks is Plankton, but it turns out to be just a cup. At this point, Mr. Krabs starts to hallucinate. He sees the cup turn into Plankton, and suddenly, red and green demon Planktons start appearing everywhere. Mr. Krabs tries to escape, but ends up running into a giant demonic Plankton with devil horns. Mr. Krabs screams and runs into the bathroom, splashing water on his face to try and reclaim his sanity. He looks at himself in the mirror, and hallucinates his eyeballs turning into Planktons. Mr. Krabs freaks out, and sprints over to the Krusty Krab's crow's next to catch his breath. Suddenly, he notices something happening across the street. SpongeBob, Squidward, Patrick, Sandy, Mrs. Puff, Old Man Jenkins, and even his own daughter Pearl are sneaking into the Chum Bucket, which makes Mr. Krabs think that everyone he cares about is working for Plankton. Mr. Krabs starts bawling his face off as he goes back into the Krusty Krab.Suddenly, a knock is heard at the Krusty Krab's front door. It is SpongeBob (who is obviously reading off of a note card), who tells Mr. Krabs that he needs to come with him to the Chum Bucket, because Plankton has kidnapped Squidward. Mr. Krabs suspects this is part of Plankton's evil plot, and tells SpongeBob he will be right out. Mr. Krabs heads into the kitchen and starts laughing to himself while making deadly Krabby Patties by putting traps, such as spikes and fireworks, inside of them. After he finishes, he and SpongeBob head over to the Chum Bucket. Once there, they see that Squidward is tied to a chair, as Plankton reveals himself. He then presses a button on a remote, and a bunch of decorations and confetti are revealed. Mr. Krabs is confused at first, but Plankton and SpongeBob explain that today is the anniversary of the first ever time that Plankton tried to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula, so they wanted to throw a surprise party for Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs is touched, apologizes for his actions, and hugs SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs then notices everyone else about to eat the deadly Krabby Patties he left on the counter. He starts to panic and takes everyone's Krabby Patties away, succumbing to their traps. The Krabby Patties start to spark loudly, zip up into the sky while Mr. Krabs is still holding them, and explode into fireworks, injuring Mr. Krabs. In the next scene, everyone happily leaves to go home (except for Squidward, who is still tied up), and SpongeBob asks Mr. Krabs if he enjoyed the party. Inside the Chum Bucket, Plankton notices that Mr. Krabs left the secret formula behind, and takes the piece of paper out, only for a stick of dynamite to be revealed underneath. The Chum Bucket violently explodes, and Mr. Krabs exclaims that he enjoyed the party very much, as the episode ends.",Plankton Paranoia,"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is marching around like a military drill sergeant while wearing a solider helmet.]
Mr. Krabs: Now we all know what this day is.
SpongeBob: Today is the day when Plankton tries to steal the Krabby Patty formula, sir! [continuously whacks Squidward with the mop while talking]
Squidward: [angrily] Like he does every day. [takes the mop from the scared SpongeBob who realizes his error]
Mr. Krabs: But this time, he's not going to catch me with me spatula down! [laughs] Ooh? [flips his spatula right side-up] SpongeBob, you're on guard duty, boy!
SpongeBob: Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs! [hops in the mop wringer bucket and heads to the front door]
Squidward: And I'll go undercover. [grabs a pillow and a blanket and goes to sleep as usual]
[Mr. Krabs glares down at Squidward before hearing SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Hup, two, three, four! Hup, two, three, four! ♪Krabby Patties are the best! They'll put hair on your chest!♪
[A female customer looks into her dress and hair pops out.]
Female customer: [gasps] Oh!
French Narrator: Three hours later...
[SpongeBob is very tired from patrolling the front door.]
SpongeBob: [weakly] ♪Krabby Patties are the best... They'll put hairs...into your nest♪ [flops down to the floor]
[Squidward wakes up from his ""undercover"" and gets whacked with the mop.]
Squidward: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: [picks SpongeBob up] Any sign of Plankton?
SpongeBob: Uh, afraid not, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: Maybe he's on vacation.
Mr. Krabs: Don't be silly! We always take our trips together, [his eyestalk enlarges at Squidward] to keep an eye on each other. What's taking that crook so long? [looks at his watch] Hm... Maybe the door is stuck. [oils the hinges on the door and sees a line of customers coming] Ah, for—these customers are blocking the way! [flips the road and sends the customers hurling into passing garbage truck; sighs] There we go. Nice, open path. [his path is nice and sparkly] Hm? Mm... Hey! Well, maybe he just needs a little incentive. [cuts to the Krusty Krab displaying the secret formula on a pillow; the sign blinkers the words ""Secret Formula"" with arrows pointing at it] There we go. [peaks over the cash register and looks at his watch; he slowly begins to worry] Maybe he doesn't want me formula anymore. [gasps as he sees the formula missing] He took the bait! We're going to red alert! [pushes the alarm button and the alarm goes off; the lights in the restaurant blink red and blue; then it covers itself with a protective shield and spins into the ground. Mr. Krabs peaks out of the ground through the telescope] Batten down the hatches! Furl the deck! Stop that greedy green goober!
[The customers moan and groan from all the spinning. SpongeBob runs around with a pile of bricks. He trips over Nat Peterson and sends the bricks flying to the window. Squidward dodges almost all of the bricks.]
Squidward: [sighs in relief but gets hit in the face by one of the bricks] Ow.
[SpongeBob bends the kitchen door down, wraps it up, and stuffs it in his head.]
Patrick: Doggone it! [shakes the bottle with the secret formula] Can I get some ketchup over here? Please?
Mr. Krabs: [slides down the rail while SpongeBob walks the dazed Squidward.] False alarm.
[The restaurant comes back out of the ground. The customers recover from the spinning and quickly run out due to motion sickness.]
Whistle: [blowing] Closing time!
[SpongeBob and Squidward remove their hats and prepare to go home. Mr. Krabs jumps in front of them, blocks the door, and grabs his employees.]
Mr. Krabs: And just where do you think you two are going?
Squidward: [pulls himself free] It's customary to go home at closing time!
SpongeBob: Aren't you going home, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [puts SpongeBob down and laughs] Oho, I'm not budging. Plankton is gonna try something. I don't know when. I don't know where.
Squidward: Probably... here?
Mr. Krabs: Well, yeah. But when he does, I'll be waiting for him. [cackles and rubs his claws in a greedy motion]
[SpongeBob and Squidward exit the front door and quietly leave. Mr. Krabs turns off the lights.]
Mr. Krabs: I'll be waiting right here.
French Narrator: The next morning...
SpongeBob: [enters the restaurant] Morning! Hm? [takes his hat while Squidward takes his] I guess Mr. Krabs went home after all.
Mr. Krabs: No, I'm still here... [reveals himself to be camouflaged into the floor] Waiting for that blasted Plankton!
[SpongeBob and Squidward become startled with Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs gets up. His eyestalks shrink to look like chameleon eyes and rolls away. The scene changes to Squidward trying to take a customer's order.]
Customer: Yeah, I'll take—
Mr. Krabs: [opens the customer's mouth] Me patty formula?! Huh?! I know it's you in there, Plankton! [shakes the bones out of the customer's body]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, that's not Plankton!
[The customer's whole skeleton falls out of the body. Mr. Krabs drops the customer's body.]
Customer: [gets up and grabs his body, now angry] I will never set foot in this establishment again! [whacks Mr. Krabs with his skeleton foot for his actions] From now on, I'm using the drive-thru! [leaves]
[Mr. Krabs gasps and sees Mrs. Puff walking out with a Krabby Patty. He fishes Mrs. Puff with the fishing hook.]
Mr. Krabs: Aha! Trying to sneak a Krabby Patty to Plankton, eh? [takes the patty from Mrs. Puff]
Mrs. Puff: But, Eugene, it's just a to-go order.
Mr. Krabs: [mocking gibberish] Well, from now on, all patties are to be eaten on the premises! [sets Mrs. Puff down]
Squidward: What are you gonna do now, ban pockets?
Mr. Krabs: Capital idea, Mr. Squidward.
[Mr. Krabs uses a reef blower to steal money from a customer's pockets. It even sucks up his clothes. Mr. Krabs puts a barrel onto the customer's body.]
Mr. Krabs: There'll be a $50-a-barrel surcharge from now on! [sucks in more clothes and money with the reef blower and gives them more barrels; Old Man Walker is about to leave, but Mr. Krabs stops him] Whoa, hey, slow down there, Grandpa. Let's just see here. [scans him with the scanner, removes his hat and reveals a stack of patties hidden in his hat] Aha! Another one of Plankton's spies!
Old Man Walker: [nervously] I just wanted some for later!
Mr. Krabs: [violently stamps him with a ""BANNED"" stamper] You're banned! [kicks him out and sees a baby sucking on a Krabby Patty] Hmm... So Plankton's recruiting baby burglars now! [removes the patty from the baby's mouth and the baby cries] Put a cork in it! [stuffs the baby's mouth with a cork and shoves both the baby and the mother in a barrel that says, ""BANNED""] You're banned! [continues to violently stamp the customers with the ""BANNED"" stamper] You! You're banned! You're banned! Banned! [one customer's head gets a nasty bump from the stamper] Banned! [Tom's teeth say the word, ""BANNED""; Mr. Krabs lifts his restaurant and bashes the customers away; he speaks through the Krusty Krab sign] You're all banned! [barricades the door while breathing heavily]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I don't think Plankton's coming.
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense! [hears a knock at the door and gasps] See?! It's that stinker Plankton now! What do you want?!
Sandy: [off-screen] Uh... A Krabby Patty?
Mr. Krabs: [Suspicious] Why?
Sandy: [off-screen] I'm hungry?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, that's just Sandy.
Mr. Krabs: [peeks through the hole and sees Sandy waving innocently] I'm not falling for it. [sticks his eyestalk through the hole and looks at Sandy] That's the worst squirrel suit I've ever seen! [shakes a spray can and sprays the word ""BANNED"" on Sandy's suit; gibbers as he begins to lose his sanity]
SpongeBob: [feeling a bit creeped out by Mr. Krabs' behavior; whispers to Squidward] Do you think Mr. Krabs is acting... strange?
[Mr. Krabs climbs up the ceiling, snaps his claws, and his mouth foams while he gibbers.]
Squidward: He seems fine to me.
SpongeBob: [whispers] Maybe we should postpone our plans for tonight.
Mr. Krabs: Plans?! Aha! You're both working for Plankton! Get out of me restaurant, you tricky treacherous traitors! [violently stamps them with the ""BANNED"" stamper and sends them flying out of the restaurant]
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab chained and barricade. Mr. Krabs is hiding underneath the register boat while protecting the Krabby Patty formula. It appears that Mr. Krabs has completely lost his mind and is completely losing full sanity of himself.]
Mr. Krabs: I know you're in here, Plankton. Where are you hiding?
Plankton: [off-screen] I'm right here... [Mr. Krabs jumps out and sees the television on] at the Chum Bucket! Come on down and try our new Chum Nuggets.
Mr. Krabs: Heh. [turns off the television] Whew. [sees Plankton's shadow and gasps; he hides behind a pole; he looks and sees that is was only a cup with two straws] Oh. [chuckles] Just a—just a cup.
[Mr. Krabs hallucinates when he sees the cup transform into Plankton. Plankton laughs evilly and Mr. Krabs becomes scared. Everywhere he looks, he sees everything transform into various images of Plankton, laughing at Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs runs to escape, but no matter how he attempts to escape, all of the images of Plankton keep following him while laughing. Mr. Krabs crawls into a hole, which turns into Plankton's eyeball and reveals a red demonic version of Plankton holding the secret formula while laughing. Back in reality, Mr. Krabs is completely losing himself and screams. He runs to the bathroom and goes to wash his face at the sink.]
Mr. Krabs: [washes his face] Get ahold of yourself. Get ahold of yourself. [turns off the faucet and sighs] I'm starting to see things. [laughs]
[Mr. Krabs hallucinates as he is seeing his eyestalks transform into Plankton. He screams and gibbers. He runs up the pole with the formula and pops out from the ceiling. Just then, he notices something going on at the Chum Bucket.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [pulls out a telescope and sees SpongeBob and Squidward entering the Chum Bucket] Those two are working for Plankton! [gasps as he sees Sandy, Mrs. Puff, Patrick, and Pearl enter the Chum Bucket]
Pearl: [bumps into the door] Ow.
Mr. Krabs: Me own daughter? [sheds a tear and sees Old Man Jenkins enter the Chum Bucket too] Oh, not Old Man Jenkins! [cries violently and goes back into the restaurant] Everyone really is out to get you. Aren't they, my little formula?
[Suddenly, the doorbell rings. Mr. Krabs goes up to the door and peaks through the hole. He sees SpongeBob standing out there.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? You have got to come with me to... [reads a note] the Chum Bucket for Plankton has kidnapped Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, so that's Plankton's evil plan? He wants me formula as ransom! What do we do? What? What's that? [leans in the bottle closely as if it was talking to him] Oh, that's just brilliant! Hold on a minute. I'll go get the ransom. [goes into the kitchen] Oh, you want a Krabby Patty, do you? Well, I'll give you a Krabby Patty. [laughs maniacally as he stuffs a variety of dangerous objects into the patties and cooks them on the grill; he makes a whole plateful of Krabby Patties; he goes to grab them, but they spark; Mr. Krabs checks them to see if they'll ignite, but nothing happens; he grabs the plate and laughs evilly; he kicks open the door] Okay, let's go rescue Squidward. [laughs]
[SpongeBob lifts the door up and appears to be flat. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs walk over to the Chum Bucket. They enter the restaurant and see Squidward tied up to a chair and gagged. Plankton appears on Squidward's head.]
Plankton: [giggles evilly] Surprised, Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Not at all, Sheldon. I knew you were up to something.
Plankton: Oh, yeah? How about now? [pulls out a remote and pushes the button]
[The lights turn on and all of Mr. Krabs' friends and family jump out.]
Plankton, Squidward, Sandy, Old Man Jenkins, Mrs. Puff, Patrick, Pearl, and SpongeBob: Surprise!
[Mr. Krabs screams in surprise. He then becomes confused.]
Plankton: Oh, come, Krabs. It's the anniversary of the first time I tried to steal your Krabby Patty formula!
SpongeBob: [places a cake on top of Plankton] So, we threw you a surprise party.
Mr. Krabs: [teary-eyed] You mean you weren't working for Plankton?!
SpongeBob: Of course not, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [sheds a tear] Oh, I shouldn't have suspected you, SpongeBob! Whew. Won't need these anymore. [laughs]
[Mr. Krabs sets the plateful of Krabby Patties down and hugs SpongeBob. All of his friends and family members forgive Mr. Krabs for his actions.]
Patrick: Oh, boy, Krabby Patties! [grabs the plate]
Sandy: Yee-haw!
[Mr. Krabs sees them go to eat the tainted patties and screams. He knows what's gonna happen if they take a bite out of them. So, he rushes over to protect them all. Mrs. Puff goes to eat the patty.]
Mr. Krabs: No! Don't eat the patties! [snatches the patty from Mrs. Puff] Gotcha. [two jellyfish come out from the patty and sting his eyestalks]
[Mr. Krabs grabs the patty from Patrick who bites his hand. A foothold trap clamps down on his eyestalks. His eyestalks are screaming in pain! He grabs the patty from Sandy, Squidward, and Old Man Jenkins.]
Mr. Krabs: Whew. [his destructive patties ignite and squirt tartar sauce on him] Ah, tartar sauce!
[The patties spin Mr. Krabs around and launch him into the air. The patties explode into a fireworks display, showing images of Mr. Krabs himself in pain. Everyone gazes at the spectacular fireworks display as if Mr. Krabs is putting on a show for them. Mr. Krabs comes back down and crashes onto the floor, completely burned.]
Mr. Krabs: [dizzy] Yay. [crumbles to ashes]
[It appears that Mr. Krabs got what he deserved for being a paranoid jerk, banning everyone from the restaurant, causing physical harm, and for letting his insane behavior put his own business in jeopardy. The scene changes to the aftermath of the anniversary party. Everyone exits the Chum Bucket and wave good-bye. But Squidward, on the other hand, is still tied to the chair as he hops along.]
Squidward: A little help here!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs leave the Chum Bucket. Mr. Krabs is now wrapped in bandages and is wearing a cast on his right arm.]
SpongeBob: Did you enjoy the surprise party, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Eh, I'll tell you in a second. [turns SpongeBob around to see the Chum Bucket]
[Meanwhile, inside, Plankton chews through the cake and pops out the top.]
Plankton: [spits some cake out] Huh? [sees the formula] Ooh, that fool Krabs left the Krabby Patty formula behind! [knocks over the bottle, opens it and pulls the paper out; he sees a stick of dynamite flaring up in the bottle as the trick surprise] Ehh! Mommy...
[The dynamite explodes and destroys the Chum Bucket.]
SpongeBob: Ooh.
Mr. Krabs: Yes, boy-o. I enjoyed it very much. [laughs as the debris of the Chum Bucket fall from above]",1.18,Luke Brookshier

She tests the cannons, only to have the ship-in-a-bottle get destroyed. She throws it out, while SpongeBob comes in, drinking the bottle, complimenting on how it was what he needed. Sandy starts to chew on her furniture, while SpongeBob asks what is happening. Sandy says there is a ship-in-a-bottle contest tomorrow, and she wants to win it, but all her ship-in-a-bottles are complete disasters. Sandy then shows all her previous ship-in-a-bottles.Sandy then says that she is all out of fresh bottles, with SpongeBob taking out the secret formula, and taking out the formula to give the bottle to Sandy. However, SpongeBob realizes his mistake, goes to an airport nearby, gets on the plane, onto a cable car into a devilish mountain. Inside is Plankton, with the formula. SpongeBob takes back the formula and goes back to the treedome. Meanwhile, Sandy has finished her new ship. SpongeBob pushes the ship into the bottle, only for it to sink in it and have Sandy start chewing her furniture again. SpongeBob suggests to Sandy that she should talk to Mr. Krabs, as he thinks that Mr. Krabs knows a lot about ships and bottles.When Mr. Krabs arrives, Mr. Krabs says that the money from the contest will be fifty fifty. SpongeBob likes that they are working together, so he gets a picture Fiasco was working on in the background. Sandy starts to make ship-in-a-bottles with a furnace. But when she shows it to Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs smashes it. When Sandy makes more, Mr. Krabs keeps smashing them. Eventually, Mr. Krabs accepts one, although he accidentally smashes that one, too. Sandy feels like a chewed-up twine after that, so she goes back to her treedome and gives up, telling Mr. Krabs that he could try to do the challenge himself. Mr. Krabs tries to find things to work with until he eventually sees Sandy's tree.The next day, when Sandy wakes, she realizes that a big ship was built in her dome made by Mr. Krabs. When Sandy asks what this is, Mr. Krabs takes her outside to show her the big ship. Sandy is astonished, but when she asks where Mr. Krabs got the wood, he said that he chopped down her tree, enraging Sandy. Sandy tries to give Mr. Krabs his comeuppance, but Mr. Krabs had already gotten on his boat and is driving the whole treedome with the ship in it to the contest. Sandy, however, is not finished, as she gets her submarine from the ground and heads to Mr. Krabs.Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is in the city, damaging property because of how big his ship-in-a-bottle is. However, he sees Sandy's submarine from the boat window of his boat, so he swerves to get Sandy off her tail. Sandy ends up destroying the front of the Krusty Krab, and SpongeBob notices this when he gets out of the kitchen. Sandy gets her submarine back on Mr. Krabs' tail, where she starts firing a ton of acorns at Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs thinks it is not enough, although he gets smashed by Sandy's submarine. Sandy then says that this is her 500th rodeo, trying to break the chain connecting Mr. Krabs' boat and the big ship-in-a-bottle. However, Mr. Krabs says that crabs are stronger than woodchucks, throwing Sandy's submarine into the distance, making Sandy chase after it. Mr. Krabs goes back to driving to the contest.At the contest, the judge checks SpongeBob's bottle. However, it does not have a ship. SpongeBob says that he is waiting for his ship to come in, as a joke, although Patrick dislikes the joke. Mr. Krabs finally gets to the contest, where he accidentally destroys the front of the place and all the ship-in-a-bottles competing because of his big ship-in-a-bottle. When the judge sees this catastrophe, he sees that Mr. Krabs' ship-in-a-bottle is quite impressive and that since it is the only one left, he would get rewarded with the trophy and the prize money.However, Sandy, in her submarine, gets in the contest and destroys Mr. Krabs' big ship-in-a-bottle accidentally. She crashes into the fountain, where she falls out of her suit with her inside only her helmet as a ball, and rolls to the judge. Since she's inside her helmet, and was the only contestant left, she wins the contest by default. Back at the treedome, Sandy has made Mr. Krabs build a replacement tree for her until she grows a new one from a seed. When Mr. Krabs gets tired, Sandy forces him to work more by electrocuting him, as the episode ends.",Surf N' Turf,"[The episode begins at Sandy's treedome. Sandy is adding the finishing touches to her ship-in-a-bottle creation.]
Sandy: One more dang dab and she'll be done. She looks fine as cream gravy. With real workin' hearts.
[The cannons in her bottle fire cannonballs. But they bounce back and destroy the ship.]
Sandy: [groans and pulls her ears in frustration] Two weeks down the drain! [throws her bottle out and takes her working goggles off] I can't win for losin'!
[SpongeBob comes in and drinks the water from Sandy's bottle.]
SpongeBob: Thanks for the hot beverage. It was just what I needed. [sighs as he shows debris from the model ship in his teeth; he hears a noise upstairs] Sandy?
[Sandy is rapidly chewing her furniture with her teeth like a beaver.]
SpongeBob: Yee-haw! You look madder than fried egg on a neckbone!
Sandy: [stops chewing] Don't even attempt a Texas saying!
SpongeBob: Sorry. What's going on?
Sandy: Oh, I wanted to win the ship-in-a-bottle contest tomorrow, but every one I make is a disaster. [shows a baby bottle with a capsized kiddie boat] My kiddie boat in a baby bottle capsized. [shows a raft deflated in a deflated bottle] My raft in an inflatable bottle deflated. [shows a tanker in a water cooler bottle leaking oil] And my tanker in a water cooler bottle had an oil spill! Now, I'm all fresh out of bottles!
[SpongeBob pulls out a bottle containing the Krabby Patty secret formula. He takes the paper and throws it out the window. He then hands the empty bottle to Sandy.]
SpongeBob: Here's a fresh bottle you can use.
Sandy: [takes the bottle] Did you just—
SpongeBob: [gasps as he realizes his mistake] I did! [peaks out and sees the formula is gone] The secret formula!
[SpongeBob runs out and heads for the Bikini Bottom Airport.]
Airport announcer: Flight 291 is now boarding. All passengers please proceed to Gate 4.
Pilot: We're good to take-off.
[SpongeBob enters the plane moments before take-off. The plane takes-off and flies into the sky. SpongeBob jumps out of the plane and lands into a cable car. The cable car takes SpongeBob to a devilish volcanic mountain that is shaped like Plankton. SpongeBob bursts through the door and sees Plankton trying to untie the rope and read the paper. He snatches the paper from Plankton.]
SpongeBob: Gimme that!
[SpongeBob turns and leaves with the secret formula, not before giving Plankton a death ray stare. SpongeBob exits the mountain before it erupts with lava. SpongeBob is sent flying back to Sandy's treedome in a ball of fire. He hits the dome glass and is completely singed. But luckily, the formula is unharmed.]
SpongeBob: Whew! That was close. [puts the formula away]
[The scene changes to Sandy adding a bit of glue to her model ship.]
Sandy: And, done! Did you bring me a bottle?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh! [opens his mouth and sticks out a bigger bottle] I borrowed one from Plankton before riding a fireball back here.
[Sandy attempts to fit her model ship in the bottle, but it's too small.]
Sandy: [groans] This won't fit.
SpongeBob: Oh, sure it will.
[SpongeBob pushes the model ship in the bottle, but he accidentally ruins it.]
Little sailor: Jump for your life!
[Two tiny sailors jump into the water and are surrounded by sharks. SpongeBob places the bottle on the shelf and puts a note saying ""Men Overboard"" in front of it.]
SpongeBob: Men overboard. [chuckles nervously]
[Sandy chews on the table in frustration. SpongeBob pulls the table back.]
SpongeBob: Sandy? Uh, Sandy, I have an idea. Let's call Mr. Krabs. I bet he knows all about ships in bottles. [holds out a black-and-white picture of Mr. Krabs kissing a bag of money] He was once a sailor.
Sandy: I don't need anybody's help! Sandy Cheeks flies alone! [bangs on the table and it crumbles] Alright, call him up.
[The scene changes to Sandy telling Mr. Krabs her dilemma.]
Sandy: Seriously, Mr. Krabs. I don't see what you can teach me.
Mr. Krabs: First lesson is math. I get half the prize money!
Sandy: What the? I'll give you 100% of my fist!
SpongeBob: [gets in between Sandy and Mr. Krabs] Uh, 50% sounds fair.
Sandy: Well, I do wanna win. Okay, 50%.
Mr. Krabs: [pulls out a chart of making the bottle] First step: create the perfect bottle.
SpongeBob: Oh, my two friends working together! I gotta get a picture for this. [sees Fiasco painting a picture of Mr. Krabs and Sandy and takes it] Thank you!
[Fiasco grumbles in anger. The scene changes to Sandy doing some glassblowing in hopes of making the perfect bottle for her model ship.]
Mr. Krabs: First, we build a furnace to make the bottles.
[Sandy pulls out the molten glass from the furnace. She takes a deep breath and blows the glass into a shoe. She does it the second time and blows it into a human brain. She does it the third time and blows it into a sea shell. She does it the fourth time and makes it into the bottle she needed for her ship.]
Sandy: Perfect and slick as a whistle. [blows in the bottle and makes a whistle; she shows the bottle to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm. [takes out a hammer and smashes the bottle] Try again.
[Sandy growls in disgust. She makes another bottle and shows it to Mr. Krabs.]
Sandy: Huh?
Mr. Krabs: [smashes the bottle with the hammer] Try again.
[Sandy makes another bottle and shows it to Mr. Krabs. This time, Mr. Krabs is on a swing.]
Sandy: Huh?
Mr. Krabs: [smashes the bottle with the hammer] Try again.
[Sandy makes another bottle.]
Mr. Krabs: [smashes the bottle with the hammer] Try again.
[Sandy makes another bottle.]
Mr. Krabs: [smashes the bottle with the hammer] Try again.
[Sandy makes another bottle.]
Mr. Krabs: [smashes the bottle with the hammer] Try again.
[She makes one more bottle and is breathing heavily in anger. Mr. Krabs holds out the hammer and goes to hit the bottle. Sandy cowers as he is going to strike at the bottle. This time, Mr. Krabs doesn't destroy it. He sees it as the perfect bottle for the model ship.]
Mr. Krabs: Perfect!
Sandy: Whew!
Mr. Krabs: Now, we can start on the ship. [accidentally smashes her bottle with the hammer] Oh, wait, um, I wasn't supposed to break that one, was I?
Sandy: [whimpers and is completely worn out] I feel like chewed-up twine. I'm goin' to bed. And you can forget about the prize money, 'cause the contest is tomorrow.
Mr. Krabs: [spits his soda out in surprise] Tomorrow?! [cries as his tears fill up his water helmet] Me prize money! Hey, mind if I take a crack at this ship bottle thing?
Sandy: Knock yourself out. [closes the door]
[Mr. Krabs desperately looks around for something to build, but sees nothing.]
Mr. Krabs: I got nothin' to work with here. [sees Sandy's tree and comes up with an idea as his eyes turn into bottles with money in them] Oh! [giggles] That prize money is as good as mine! [giggles]
[The scene changes to the next morning. Sandy wakes up from her sleep, yawns and stretches. A crow next to her is cawing loudly. She hits the crow and it flies off. She looks around and sees herself standing in the main mast of the ship Mr. Krabs built himself.]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, matey!
Sandy: [jumps down from the mast] What is all this?
Mr. Krabs: [throws his tools away] Hang on. Just let me show ya! [grabs Sandy's hand, puts her in her water suit and takes her outside her dome] Ta-da! [shows her the ship-in-a-bottle outside of her treedome] It's the biggest ship-in-a-bottle ever! It's sure to win the contest!
Sandy: That's amazing, Mr. Krabs! You got some [elbows Mr. Krabs] snap in your old garters after all! Yee-haw! We're gonna win for sure! Woo-hoo! [she and Mr. Krabs dance around for a bit] By the way, where'd you get all the wood?
Mr. Krabs: I chopped down your tree.
Sandy: [sighs] That's great. [pauses] You what?! [gasps]
[Sandy turns and sees all of her nooks and crannies from her tree nailed onto the ship Mr. Krabs built.]
Mr. Krabs: Uh-oh. [backs away]
Sandy: [her shock turns to anger] Why you low-down, no good, bottom-dwellin'—! [Mr. Krabs runs away] Dadgummit! Come back here! You wanna see what I'm gonna do to you?! [chews a nearby boulder and forms it into Mr. Krabs] First, I'm gonna do this! [karate chops the statue] Then, I'm gonna do this! [kicks the statue]
[Mr. Krabs hops in his boat and reverses it up to the front door of Sandy's treedome. He ties the door with the chain and begins driving away with it.]
Mr. Krabs: My work, my prize money. Eugene Krabs flies alone!
Sandy: [gasps] What?! [screams as she sees her dome being dragged away by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Blow a kiss, jellyfish! [cackles as he drives away with Sandy's treedome]
Sandy: She-oot! He is more slippery than a pocket full of puddin'. I'm-a comin' for my ship-in-a-bottle, Krabs! [activates the button on her suit and her submarine emerges from the ground; she hops into her submarine and proceeds to chase after Mr. Krabs] Yee-haw! We got ourselves a good old-fashioned high speed chase and Texas barbecue! [flips some acorns on the grill with her spatula and plays chase music on her radio]
Driver: Look out!
[People on the streets panic as Sandy's treedome nearly hits them. Mr. Krabs sees Sandy's submarine heading towards him.]
Mr. Krabs: Hard to port!
[Mr. Krabs swerves the boat left and right before turning and damaging some buildings. One building sends Sandy's submarine crashing through the roof of the Krusty Krab, leaving a gapping hole. Sandy backs-up her submarine through the front, which leaves another hole in the restaurant.]
SpongeBob: [comes out with a Krabby Patty] Order up! Okay, who's eating— [sees the hole] Ooh, al fresco.
Sandy: [loads her compartment with acorns as ammunition] I was saving these for lunch. But now is a good a time as ever to start a diet. [closes the compartment door and pushes the launch button]
[Sandy's submarine fires the acorns through at straw at Mr. Krabs. Sandy keeps firing the acorns at Mr. Krabs until one big one clobbers his back.]
Mr. Krabs: [screams] Clap of thunder! [his shell cracks and breaks] Is that all you got? Hmm? Oh no. [gets crushed by Sandy's submarine] Oh, why did I ask that question?
Sandy: [comes out through the hatch] Yee-hoo! This ain't my first rodeo! [holds up her rodeo championship belt] This is my 500th rodeo!
[Sandy jumps off and hops onto the chain connecting her treedome to Mr. Krabs' boat. She takes off her helmet and goes to chew on the chain, which also catching some breathing through her helmet. Unfortunately, Mr. Krabs lifts Sandy's submarine up with his claws.]
Mr. Krabs: Silly mammal! You forget that crabs are stronger than woodchucks! [throws Sandy's submarine out in the distance]
Sandy: That old crab's got more guts than you can hang on a fence. [jumps off the chain and goes after her submarine] This ain't over, Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Hmm...There ain't no sadder sight than a rodent runnin' after her submarine.
[Mr. Krabs proceeds to drive the treedome to the ship-in-a-bottle contest. But as he drives, he destroys several boats and sets them on fire. Meanwhile at the ship-in-a-bottle contest, many contestants are displaying their ship-in-a-bottle creations. The judge is going around looking at everything and is examining them to see which is the best. He sees one without a model ship in it.]
Judge: Hmm. What happened here?
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm still waiting for my ship to come in. [laughs]
[Patrick disgustedly shakes his head at SpongeBob as he didn't find his joke funny. Outside, Mr. Krabs drives the treedome toward the building and puts the brake on. But the treedome slams into Mr. Krabs and it pushes him towards the building. People, who are standing outside the building, scream and run away.]
Kid: You think we'll win, Dad?
Kid's father: Hard work is its own reward, son. Or should I say Admiral?
[Mr. Krabs and the treedome crash through the wall. Mr. Krabs crashes his boat into the fountain.]
Contestant: Look out!
[The treedome swerves around, destroying everyone else's ship-in-a-bottle creations in the process. As the smoke clears, everyone looks and glares at Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] So, what do you think, Judge? Ain't she a beauty? A ship in a glass bottle of epic proportions!
Judge: Hmm. Well, it is rather impressive. But more importantly, it's the only intact ship-in-a-bottle here. I have no choice but to declare you the winner. [hands Mr. Krabs the trophy containing the prize money]
Mr. Krabs: That's right. Hand it over! [grabs the trophy and rubs the prize money on his face while sighing]
[Suddenly, Sandy comes flying in with her submarine, causing havoc all over the place.]
Sandy: Ya-hoo!
[Sandy crashes her submarine into her treedome and destroys Mr. Krabs' model ship. Then she crashes her submarine into the fountain and is ejected out. She slips out of her watersuit and rolls over towards the judge's feet in her air helmet. The judge picks her up and looks at her. Sandy giggles nervously as she's expecting to judge to be angry at her.]
Judge: Wow, this is unprecedented. But since there are no more ships-in-a-bottle to judge, I'm forced to give the prize to this squirrel-in-a-bottle.
[The audience cheers and gives Sandy a round of applause. Sandy has indeed won the ship-in-a-bottle contest as well as the prize money after all.]
Sandy: Yee-haw!
[The scene changes back to Sandy's treedome. Mr. Krabs is punished for his malicious actions and is sent to do long hours of community service around Sandy's treedome. For starters, he is forced to build her a temporary tree until a new one grows.]
Sandy: [counting her prize money] That temporary tree should do until the seed I planted grows into a new one. [pushes the seed in the flower pot and plants it]
Mr. Krabs: [sweating to the bone] Whew!
Sandy: Let's go, you bag of shells! I want you jumpin' like hot grease on a skillet! [pushes the button on her remote and activates Mr. Krabs' electric collar]
Mr. Krabs: [gets zapped by his electric collar] Ha, ha, sorry, Ms. Cheeks. Okay, I'll be right— [gets zapped again] Hee, hee, ha, okay, I'm—uh, I'm workin'! I'm— [gets zapped again]",1.40,Kaz

SpongeBob gets nervous and hides in the dressing room, but Mr. Krabs threatens to fire SpongeBob if he does not perform.SpongeBob goes out to perform, but his stage fright can be visible from making a Krabby Patty with the wrong ingredients. SpongeBob hides under the grill, but while under the grill, he decides to make a puppet named ChefBob with a paper lunch sack that he finds. The puppet became an instant success, but when Squidward snubs a customer under his breath, the puppet becomes alive and overhears him, and begins to make jokes that infuriate SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs, without SpongeBob operating or voicing. ChefBob then starts to make insulting jokes, which the customers appreciate as comedy.After the puppet makes fun of Squidward, SpongeBob fights with the puppet, causing the customers to leave. Afterward, the puppet is ""fired"" and gets kicked out of the restaurant by Squidward.Finally, the episode closes with Squidward showing the others.

The customers are crowding in front of the little window. Bubble Bass is sitting on Squidward and Squidward struggles to free himself from the bottom.]
Squidward: [grunts as he tries to free himself] You people are proof that evolution can go in reverse!
Customers: Shh!
[The customers watch as SpongeBob juggles the Krabby Patties and roll them onto the grill. Three patties remain spinning until SpongeBob ""shoots"" them flat like shooting a gun.]
Customers: Ooh! Ahh!
[SpongeBob sprays ketchup and mustard on the buns. He bangs on the grill and sends the patties flying. Then he makes six perfect Krabby Patties.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da!
[The customers applaud for SpongeBob's talented performance.]
Bubble Bass: Ooh, impressive! That's most impressive!
[Mr. Krabs comes in.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, why aren't these walking wallets spending money?
Squidward: [grunts and talks muffled] Because they're too busy watching SpongeBob cook!
Mr. Krabs: What? [climbs onto Squidward]
Squidward: [gets stepped on by Mr. Krabs] Ow!
[Mr. Krabs climbs onto the customers and take a peak in the kitchen. SpongeBob is spraying ketchup and mustard on the buns.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm. Well, he's not exactly maximerizing his worktime with those flourishes. But, boy, does that boy-o have talent. [his eyes become light bulbs with dollar signs on them; he turns them on with his nose] Ding! [climbs down and grabs a mallet] And talent equals money!
[The customers turn and run as they see Mr. Krabs preparing to smash a hole in the wall. Squidward screams and runs away as well. Mr. Krabs smashes the wall really hard and makes a massive hole between the kitchen and the dining room. SpongeBob finishes his juggling act and turns around. He becomes startled to see the massive hole Mr. Krabs made.]

Mr. Krabs: Calm your waters, lad. I just knocked it down.

Mr. Krabs: In the restaurant business, it's called an open kitchen so the customers can watch the cook cook.
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, I don't think I can take that kind of pressure.
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense. You're a born performer. [looks around and sees a closet] Ooh! [carries SpongeBob to the closet] Here. [takes out a pen, opens it, and draws a star on it] You even got your own dressing room. See? Huh? Huh?
[A Krabby Patty falls from the shelf. SpongeBob runs in and locks the door.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm? Uh... [jiggles the doorknob] Come on, boy-o, it's showtime!
SpongeBob: [whimpers as he looks through the mop on his head] I can't! I've got stage fright!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, if you don't come out, you're fired!
[SpongeBob reluctantly comes out of the closet and feels nervous.]
Mr. Krabs: There he is! [flicks SpongeBob's hat off and gives him a toque] ChefBob! [grabs SpongeBob and closes the closet with his foot] Me little star! [pushes SpongeBob to the grill] Break a leg. Break two legs.
Fred: [holds up his leg] My leg!
Mr. Krabs: Shut up, Fred! [makes his leave] Ta-da! Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!
[The customers cheer. SpongeBob is really nervous and unsure about this open kitchen business. He grabs a patty and he wipes the sweat off his head.]
Customers: Ooh!
[SpongeBob puts the patty onto the grill, but accidentally burns it. He grabs a bun filled with mustard and puts the burnt patty on it. He puts his shoe and a bar of soap on the patty. SpongeBob presents it and the customers seem confused.]
Harold Reginald: What?
[Now Mr. Krabs is getting a little nervous, but keeps his cool by smiling.]
Fred: That's just wrong!
[SpongeBob grabs a tube of toothpaste and smears it on the patty. The customers are still confused.]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, boy-o! Razzle-dazzle them!
[SpongeBob hides under the grill trying to think of a solution to his stage fright problem.]
SpongeBob: Oh, what do I do? What do I do? [sees a paper bag] Huh? Oh!
[SpongeBob grabs the bag and makes it into a small little puppet version of himself, ChefBob. He slowly shows the puppet to the customers and Mr. Krabs. The customers are amazed at it.]
ChefBob: Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?
[The customers shrug in confusion. The couldn't figure out how to respond to it. One customer was gnawing on his hand.]
Dave: I guess I am.
ChefBob: Welcome, welcome to my job in the kitchen of ChefBob! I cook and dance, I wear square pants, cooking for this hungry mob! [singsong] Your order, please!
[The customers cheer and SpongeBob is happy.]
Mr. Krabs: [rubs his claws together] The little ChefBob is a sensation.
[The scene changes to all of the customers gathering around to see the ChefBob show Mr. Krabs put up. ChefBob comes out from the curtain.]
ChefBob: Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?
Customers: We are!
[ChefBob grabs some patties and juggles them. and roll them onto the grill. Three patties remain spinning until SpongeBob ""shoots"" them flat like shooting a gun just like how SpongeBob did earlier. SpongeBob grins happily at ChefBob's performance. ChefBob flips three patties and grabs one with a whip. He gives the patty to a cowboy and stamps a picture of himself with a branding iron.]
ChefBob: Huh?
[The scene changes to ChefBob playing magic tricks with the patties. He pulls a patty from Jennifer Millie and Clay's ears.]
ChefBob: Ha, ho! Ha, ho! Voilà!
[ChefBob throws the patties on the grill after they bounced onto Squidward's nose.]
ChefBob: Ta-da!
[The customers cheer.]
Clay: [looks at his watch] Oh-ho! Look at the time. I gotta get home and get my beauty sleep.
Squidward: Oh, what died on that guy's neck? Oh, it's his head.
[Squidward's insult was accidentally heard out loud by ChefBob.]
ChefBob: Huh?
[ChefBob comes up with an idea. He thinks that he could use insults to make himself popular. He slides over to Clay just as he was about to leave.]
ChefBob: Hey, what died on your neck? Oh, it's your head!
[The customers laugh, but Squidward is offended by it. Clay felt embarrassed at first, but laughs along with the customers.]
Squidward: Oh, that little plagiarist. That was my line.
Clay: [laughs] Obviously, the sleep hasn't been helping! [makes a hideous face as he laughs]
[SpongeBob becomes shocked at what he just heard.]
SpongeBob: D-did I say that? I didn't say that.
Jennifer Mille: [laughs and grabs ChefBob] Hey, do me! Insult me!
ChefBob: Alright. Roses are red, violets are blue, I was born pretty, what happened to you?
Jennifer Mille: [laughs] That was a good one.
ChefBob: [gets grabbed by SpongeBob] Huh? Oh!
SpongeBob: ChefBob, we don't speak like that to our customers.
Harold (red fish): Me next! [ChefBob goes back up] Shoot me a zinger!
ChefBob: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get that. [shoots an arrow on Harold's head] I don't speak ""goober!""
[The paper with the word ""Goober"" rolls down and the customers laugh.]
Harold (red fish): [laughs] I love it! Guilty as charged! [laughs and sheds a tear]
[The customers yell out at ChefBob to make more insults and give him money and jewels. He even gives them their autographs for their books and their children.]
Squidward: Oh, great. I've created a monster. A funny, talented monster.
[The scene changes to ChefBob powdering his nose in his dressing room.]
Mr. Krabs: Ho, ho, ho, ho! [flicks money] Oh, I gotta hand it to ya! That new insult comedy act is really bringing in the money!
[SpongeBob, with a sad look on his face, turns around and gives Mr. Krabs a paper.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, what's this, here?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. It's a list of things ChefBob needs for his little dressing room.
Mr. Krabs: Oh-ho, does he? [reads the list] ""Fresh cut seaweed."" [his smile turns upside-down] ""A manicurist for SpongeBob's puppet hand?"" What? [gets angry] ""A bigger dressing room?""
ChefBob: In the meantime, we'll just take over your office, Blubber Boy.
Mr. Krabs: Blubber Boy?! [his belly blubbers; he lowers his shirt and rips up the paper] No way! [stomps the paper bits on the ground]
ChefBob: [grabs Mr. Krabs] What's the matter, Krabs? [flicks his nose] You don't like money? [whacks Mr. Krabs in the face with money]
[Mr. Krabs takes the money and puts them in the bag.]
Mr. Krabs: [weepy] What?... Of course I like money. The office will be ready in five minutes. [leaves]
SpongeBob: ChefBob, I think your insults are mean and hurtful. What do you say we just go back to the Krabby Patty routines, huh?
ChefBob: Need I remind you that my insults pay your salary?
SpongeBob: Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir.
[SpongeBob and ChefBob leave the closet.]
Squidward: ChefBob, you stole my line! I do all the insults around here!
ChefBob: [grabs Squidward's hand] Oh, I am so sorry, Squidward. You're absolutely right.
Squidward: Um, oh, well, uh, thank you. It's—it's—it's really not such a big deal.
ChefBob: Let me make it up to ya! [grabs Squidward and drags him and SpongeBob outside] Hi, everybody! I'd like to introduce you to a very good friend of mine: Squidward Tentacles!
[The customers cheer.]
Squidward: Huh? Oh, no. Please, please, you're to—you're too kind.
ChefBob: I was gonna ask Squidward how old he was, but then I remembered he can't count that high!
Squidward: [dumbfounded] Huh?
[ChefBob sprays water in Squidward's eye and the customers laugh at his humiliation. Squidward shrinks down nervously and pops.]
SpongeBob: [growls] Alright, that's it! You can't talk to Squidward that way! He is one of my best friends!
Squidward: [reappears next to Mr. Krabs] That's even more insulting.
ChefBob: Get a load of him, folks! He must've been born on a highway because that's where most accidents happen! [grabs a rubber chicken and hits SpongeBob with it]
[The customers laugh. SpongeBob grabs the rubber chicken and goes to whack ChefBob with it, but ends up hitting Nat Peterson.]
Nat Peterson: Ow! Not funny!
[SpongeBob and ChefBob both get into a fight. ChefBob flings SpongeBob to a table and crash onto it. The customers continue to think this is part of the act and continue to laugh. ChefBob grabs SpongeBob, swings him around and flings him to the bathroom.]
Jimmy Gus: He scores!
[The customers rush into the bathroom.]
Fred: Yeah, yeah! Fight in the bathroom!
[ChefBob is trying to push SpongeBob down the toilet.]
ChefBob: Have a drink!
[SpongeBob struggles to get up, but ChefBob pushes him down the toilet. SpongeBob pulls the lever, hoping to flush ChefBob down along with him.]
ChefBob: No, no! [grabs the lever but gets flushed down the toilet]
[The customers become worried now that SpongeBob and ChefBob are flushed. In the kitchen, SpongeBob and ChefBob emerge from the sink and crash into a box of spatulas. SpongeBob and ChefBob engage in a spatula sword fight.]
SpongeBob: En garde!
[SpongeBob and ChefBob fight each other with all their might. They exit the kitchen and continue their fight in the dining room while the customers watch. ChefBob removes the spatula from SpongeBob's grasp and goes to finish him. SpongeBob holds his ground and keeps ChefBob's spatula from hitting him. ChefBob cackles evilly as if he was about to win. Just as ChefBob was about to deliver the final blow, SpongeBob lifts ChefBob, grabs the spatula with his teeth, and throws it onto a poster in the wall. SpongeBob hops in the boat, opens the cash register and slams the drawer onto ChefBob. The customers gasp in fright and realize that SpongeBob and ChefBob's battle is not part of the act and is not funny at all. The parent and the child cry at the sight. The customers become disgusted with this and they leave the restaurant just as SpongeBob collapses from exhaustion.]
Mr. Krabs: Me customers! [gets angry and walks over to ChefBob, who's punching SpongeBob] Alright, enough of this. [grabs ChefBob off of SpongeBob's hand and holds up a hand puppet version of himself]
Hand puppet Mr. Krabs: ChefBob, you are hereby fired! [punches ChefBob to the floor] Mr. Squidward, will you do the honors?
[Squidward holds up a hand puppet version of himself.]
Hand puppet Squidward: [picks up ChefBob] Let me help you slip into something more comfortable. Like the gutter!
[Squidward kicks ChefBob out the door. ChefBob gets run over by a boat, trampled on by a little girl's pogo stick, and swept away by a street cleaner.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] I learned a very valuable lesson today.
Hand puppet Mr. Krabs: To always be yourself and not hide behind a puppet?
SpongeBob: Well, yeah, that, but [holds up his swollen hand] mostly don't slam your puppet hand in a register drawer. [his hand thumps]
[SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs all share a laugh together.]
SpongeBob: Ow.
[The scene changes to the next day. Squidward screams at something on the television.]
SpongeBob: [overlapping] What is it, Squidward?
Mr. Krabs: [overlapping] What is it, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: It's—it's alive! [points to the television]
TV Announcer: And now, it's time for the ChefBob Cooking with Insults Show! And here's your host, ChefBob!
ChefBob: Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?
[The live action audience cheers.]
ChefBob: Alright. Roses are red, violets are blue, I was born pretty, what happened to you?
[The live action audience cheer once more.]
ChefBob: Yay, yeah! Yay, yeah!
[SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs are completely shocked and they all faint to the floor. The curtains close and the words ""The End"" appear on the screen, ending the episode.]",1.04,Kaz

After that, Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to go back to cooking patties, but the grill is missing. When SpongeBob sees that the grill wasn't outside where he put it, he panics, but notices there's a trail leading to an abandoned race boat garage.Inside it, a couple of kids are decorating the grill and turning it into a race cart. Mr. Krabs tells them that he owns the grill, but they aren't willing to give it back. After Mr. Krabs gets hurt by one of their contraptions, SpongeBob tries to talk to them as he has the heart of a child. He tells the kids that his cart is better than the grill, making them angry and want to race against SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs to see who truly has the fastest cart.On Murder Hill, the kids as well as Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob bring their carts so they can race down the hill. Plankton also joins the race with a roller skate in an attempt to obtain the formula, but his cart gets destroyed by Mr. Krabs easily before the race even starts. The remaining two carts go down the hill, with the kids seeming like they're going to win. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs he needs to have the mindset of a child, so he uses his imagination by taking some plugs from a plug factory to win.After SpongeBob plugs a wire onto the grill, the top becomes hot and causes the kids to get burnt and fall off the grill, allowing SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs to win the race and keep the grill, but they crash into a nearby pole after crossing the finish line. As the episode ends, Mr. Krabs, in a body cast, tells the story of how he won the race to some other older citizens, while the kids turn the Krusty Krab into a cart and ride it into the distance.",The Grill is Gone,"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. The place is a complete mess and all of the customers are sick to the stomach after eating too much Krabby Patties.]
Mr. Krabs: All right, Krusty crew, listen up. Last night's buy one get one full price Krabby Patty sale went great! But the crowds left me restaurant dirtier than usual.
[Squidward rolls his eyes in disgust. Mr. Krabs looks at Squidward and smears a smug of goop off his face.]
Squidward: Hey!
Mr. Krabs: Eeeh! [smears the goop on SpongeBob's face] So I'm gonna need you to clean until this whole place sparkles!
SpongeBob: Ooh, you've got it, Mr. K.
[SpongeBob takes out a vacuum, plugs it in his face, and begins sucking up the garbage. He sucks the garbage from two customers, making one look like a handsome millionaire and one a skeleton. Then he sucks the remaining garbage all over the restaurant. He scrubs the cash register clean with a brush. He notices the brush is dirty and scrubs it with the toothbrush. He scrubs the screen with the two brushes, creating a transition to outside. SpongeBob then goes outside, plugs a hose in his head and fills himself up with water. Then, like a outdoor sprinkler, he dances around and sprays water all over the place, making the restaurant sparkly clean inside and out.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, are you all done cleaning?
SpongeBob: [sprays water in Mr. Krabs' face] Oh, just finishing up now, Mr. Krabs.
[Mr. Krabs grabs the hose, ties it in a knot and throws it out. The kitchen is now all sparkly clean.]
Mr. Krabs: This place looks great! Well done, lad. All right, [puts the work hat on SpongeBob's head] time to get back to cooking. [notices the grill is missing] Huh? Oh, where's the grill?
SpongeBob: Oh, I took it outside to air dry. [opens the back door] See?
Mr. Krabs: Hmm. [looks around and sees nothing] See what?
SpongeBob: [crawls over Mr. Krabs and goes outside] The grill. It's right here.
Mr. Krabs: Right here, where?
SpongeBob: Under my arm, silly.
Mr. Krabs: The grill is gone.
SpongeBob: [laughs] The grill is gone. [notices the grill is in fact missing] The grill is gone?! [falls down, screams, and runs in panic] The grill is gone! The grill is gone! The grill is gone! The grill is gone! The grill is gone! [screams and breathes heavily while Mr. Krabs just stand there and roll his eyes] Grill gone! The grill gone! Oh, look, it must be the grill's trail. [licks the sand] There's still some grease flavor here. Come on, Mr. Krabs, I'll taste the trail all the way to the grill.
Mr. Krabs: Um, we could just use our eyes, boy-o.
SpongeBob: Oh, great idea, Mr. Krabs. [walks on his eyeballs]
[Mr. Krabs groans and follows SpongeBob. SpongeBob follows the trail to an old, abandoned race boat garage. He blinks the sand off his eyes.]
SpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs, a race boat garage. But what would a garage need a grill for?
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob go up the window and peak inside.]
Mr. Krabs: This ain't no garage. [sees four children] This here's a clubhouse for local ragamuffins, urchins, and waifs. [sees the grill] Look, and there's me grill.
SpongeBob: What are they doing to it, Mr. Krabs?
[The two twins spray paint all over the grill's sides to look like flames.]
Boy twin: Whoa.
Girl twin: Cool.
Boy twin: Whoa.
Girl twin: Whoop.
SpongeBob: Aah! No!
[The smallest kid hammers a wheel on the lower half of the grill.]
SpongeBob: Why?! Why?!
[The chubby kid with a red hat drills a steering wheel on the grill's surface.]
SpongeBob: No! Not the cooking surface! That's where all the flavor is! [cries]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, zip it!
SpongeBob: Ooh, thanks. [zips his pants] You know, not every friend'll tell you when you—
Mr. Krabs: [clamps SpongeBob's mouth shut] You stay here. I'm gonna get me grill back.
SpongeBob: But how, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, boy-o, they're just kids. They have to listen to me. [pulls up his pants and goes inside] Hello, children. I'm an adult. This here is me grill, so I'll just be taking it back now.
Hat kid: Hey, what do you think you're doing, mister? That's our racing cart!
Mr. Krabs: Racing cart?! That's no ""racing cart."" That there is a top-of-the-line Grill King 3000, and it belongs to me. [holds up the documents] See? I brought all the relevant paperwork. [gives the documents to the children]
Hat kid: This looks more like homework. [rips up the document] We don't take kindly to homework around here.
Boy twin: Yeah!
Girl twin: Homework stinks!
[The twins rip up the documents too. The smallest kid eats the document and spits it in Mr. Krabs' face.]
Hat kid: I think you just wanna steal our racing cart.
Mr. Krabs: I can't steal something I already own! [groans] That's it! Out of me way, you imps! [pushes the hat kid] Grown-up coming through!
Hat kid: Hold your sea horses, old man! [winks at the small kid]
[The small kid winks back at the hat kid. The small kid climbs the ladder, holds up a carrot and makes a sea horse spin around. The sea horse activates the drill and pokes a worm underneath, causing it to yelp in pain. The worm pulls on a rope, causing a hammer to remove a nail and forces a plank to hit Mr. Krabs' rear end.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa! Heh, that's it? Your little kiddie trap doesn't— [gets crushed by two log and the kids laugh]
[SpongeBob gets in between the logs and separates them.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you okay?
[Mr. Krabs groans and falls flat on the floor.]
SpongeBob: [helps Mr. Krabs up] Let me try talking to them, Mr. Krabs. I think I can reach them. After all, I have something you don't: the heart of a child. [shows his heart laughing like a baby; he goes over to the kids and looks at the grill] Yeah, not a bad little cart you guys have built.
Hat kid: Oh, gee, mister, you think so?
SpongeBob: Mm-hmm, too bad it looks slow.
All four kids: Huh?!
SpongeBob: Yep, no way this thing could beat our cart, not in a million years. [spins the steering wheel]
Hat kid: Our cart is the fastest in Bikini Bottom!
Both twins: The fastest!
SpongeBob: Oh, really? If only there was some way to prove it.
Hat kid: How's about a race, then?
SpongeBob: How's about the winner of the race gets to keep the loser's racing cart?
Hat kid: How's about it's on? See you tomorrow morning at the top of Murder Hill. [leaves with the other kids]
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob by his nose] What do you think you're doing, boy-o? We don't have a racing cart!
SpongeBob: Of course we do, Mr. Krabs. There's just some assembly required.
[Mr. Krabs lets SpongeBob go.]
French Narrator: Zee Next Morning...
[The scene changes to the next morning. Thunder claps around the sign that reads, ""Murder Hill."" SpongeBob pulls the racing cart he and Mr. Krabs made. It consists of two tables, a worn-our driver's seat, the cash register for the steering wheel and the register boat for the cart.]
Mr. Krabs: You sure we built this thing right? It looks a little funky.
SpongeBob: Well, what do you mean? [holds up the blueprint] We followed my blueprint. [the table in SpongeBob's blueprint falls off] Besides, there's nothing to worry about. We just have to make it through one quick race down this teensy weensy little [stretches himself as he looks down the hill] deadly, steep, utterly terrifying hill! [gasps]
[As he looks down the hill, he sees a couple of boats driving, some erupting volcanoes, flying dinosaurs, and deadly traps near the finish line. SpongeBob gulps nervously and the four kids arrive with the grill. The kids laugh at SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs' cart.]
Hat kid: Ha! You call that a racing cart? Looks more like the slow boat to Palookaville.
[The kids laugh obnoxiously.]
Mr. Krabs: It's on, you whippersnappers! [grabs SpongeBob and hops into the cart; he then notices Plankton in a cart of his own] Plankton, what are you doing here?
Plankton: When I heard your grill was on the line, I had to get in on this race. If there's even one little smudge of patty on there, the formula will be mine. [activates the spikes on his cart]
[The worm from the race cart garage holds up the racing flag. The kids, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton growl at each other. The worm waves the flag and the race begins. But before it does, Mr. Krabs flicks Plankton off the track, sending him flying and crashing into a rock.]
Plankton: Barnacles!
[SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs and the kids go down the hill. Mr. Krabs and the hat kid stare and growl at each other. The contestants drive all the way down the hill until they reach the streets of Bikini Bottom, running over several people in the process. They even run into Bubble Bass and cause him to lose his Krabby Patty. The twins hold up two bags of marbles and throw them in Mr. Krabs' eye.]
Boy twin: Ha, ha, take that!
Mr. Krabs: [shakes the marble off] Watch it, you hooligan!
[The twins throw more marbles at Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs attempts to smash into the kids, but ends up getting his eyestalks grabbed and strangled by them.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, look out!
[The kids, Mr. Krabs, and SpongeBob are heading straight to an incoming intersection. SpongeBob skids his foot to slow the cart down, but ends up burning his foot. The kids, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs crash into the intersection, causing a major pile up. One boat hits Mr. Krabs' eyestalks and send it flying into the pile up, causing it to fall over. The smallest kid comes out from the grill's oven, takes out a pair of pliers and clips the front wheel off of SpongeBob's cart.]
All four kids: Ha, ha!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, the steering's out! They cut our brakes! What do we do?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, oh, uh, maybe we should call their parents?
SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs! You can't win a kid's game by thinking like an adult! You have to think young. [shows himself as an innocent child]
Mr. Krabs: You're right, boy-o. We have to delve deep back into me childhood! [takes out a teddy bear, curls up in a fetal position, sucks his thumb and cries like a baby]
SpongeBob: Too far back, Mr. Krabs! Too far!
Mr. Krabs: [snaps out of it] Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Check this out. [hops to the back] I learned it in me old Wormtown skating days! [leans the cart back and skates like a skateboard]
SpongeBob: Whoa, Mr. Krabs, I didn't know you could shred.
Mr. Krabs: [sees the ""Plug and Such"" store] Whoo, hey. [gets an idea] I got a plan! Hold on!
[Mr. Krabs swerves the cart into the plug store and grabs a really long plug. Then they catch up to the four kids and the grill.]
Mr. Krabs: Plug 'em in, boy-o!
[SpongeBob takes the plug and goes to plug it in the back of the grill. But every attempt makes him miss the outlet.]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, SpongeBob! What's the holdup?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. My hands get clammy when I'm defying death. [reveals a clam in his hand] See? Ta-dah. [laughs as he lets the clam goes and flies in between Mr. Krabs' eyes]
Mr. Krabs: Enough magic tricks! Plug 'em in!
[SpongeBob finally plugs the grill.]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah!
[All of the sudden, the grill's surface begins to light up. It causes the hat kid's bottom and the twin's feet to burn. They hop up and down in pain until the plug stops the grill and sends the four kids flying off. They land on the ground and the smallest kid comes out in a pie.]
SpongeBob: Yay, the finish line!
[Plankton crawls up to the finish line, but gets crushed by SpongeBob's cart. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs cross the finish line, but they end up crashing into a pole and getting themselves hurt.]
Mr. Krabs: [shudders] I won.
[The scene changes back to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are covered in bandages in order to recuperate. SpongeBob happily flips the patties on the grill and hugs it now that he's happy that he got it back. Mr. Krabs is in the dining room talking to some grown-ups about their adventure.]
Mr. Krabs: And so, after some quick thinking and fancy racerin', I won me grill back. I looked at those kids in the eye and said, ""I own these streets. Don't ever come back to me restaurant ever again...Until you have money."" Adults rule!
[Mr. Krabs and the grown-ups laugh. Suddenly, they hear a loud crash outside.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, what's going on?
[It was the four obnoxious kids again. This time, they're using the whole restaurant as a racing cart instead.]
Hat kid: Whoa, let's see 'em beat us this time. [whistles]
[The twins and the small kid push the restaurant forward and hop on.]
SpongeBob: Here we go cart again! [laughs as the restaurant begins to drive away]
Mr. Krabs: Zip it, boy-o.
SpongeBob: Oh, thanks, Mr. Krabs. Not everybody'll tell you when— [gets cut off as the restaurant drives down the road]",1.37,Andrew Goodman

Squidward tries to babysit Pearl, but she leaves while he is demonstrating what they could do. He goes upstairs to see what Pearl is doing, but gets scared when he sees that Pearl made a ""R.I.P. Squidward"" model while she was pretending to do arts and crafts.After getting Squidward out of her hair, Pearl goes through a secret entrance in her room to hop in Dylan's boat to go to the party. Squidward goes back inside the room to check on Pearl but thinks that she ripped her neck after seeing that what looked like Pearl was actually her head made out of crafts. After seeing Pearl going away with Dylan after falling into the secret entrance, Squidward follows them with his recumbent bicycle.Pearl enjoys the party with her friends until Squidward arrives and tries to get her back. Dylan tells her to forget Squidward and go breaching, so she decides to do that. However, she ends up getting stuck on the island, and everyone at the party escapes. Squidward ends up saving her, and the two ride home. The episode ends with Squidward and Pearl deciding to prank Dylan by mailing SpongeBob to him, as the episode ends.",Whale Watching,"[The episode begins at Mr. Krabs' house. A boat drives up to the curb where a handsome narwhal named Dylan is dropping Pearl off.]
Pearl: Oh, thanks for the ride, Dylan. [blinks her eyelids]
Dylan: No problem, Pearl. You still going for that party tonight? [waves his hair]
Pearl: [gasps] Oh-ho! You bet! [melts herself out of the boat]
Dylan: Nautical. [clicks his tongue] I'll pick ya up at eight. [drives away]
[Pearl is incredibly head of heels with her new boyfriend. She sighs and gently floats to the door, leaving a trail of dust that forms the word, ""Swoon."" Pearl's floating crashes through the front door and floats over to Mr. Krabs. She stops floating when she wakes up from her daydreaming.]
Mr. Krabs: Again? Come on, Pearly-girl, we're running low on doors here! [picks out a door from the closet and pastes it to the front door]
Pearl: Oh, I'm sorry, Daddy. I'm just so excited about going to the big party tonight! I—I—I just had to...
Mr. Krabs: [cuts Pearl off] Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Sorry, sweetie. [puts on his hat] Daddy's going out to play cards with the boys tonight. [his teeth is full of cards, his spits them out, and puts them in his sleeve]
Pearl: But, but Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: No buts! I can't be worrying about you all night, honey.
Pearl: [begins to tear up] But, Daddy, I just want to go to the party! [her eyes fill up with tears]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, shrimp.
[Mr. Krabs takes cover and Pearl cries a huge fountain of tears.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa!
[Pearl's tears destroyed everything it touched. The tears destroy a plant and a picture on the shelf. The tears destroy the picture of Grandpa Redbeard, a grandfather clock and Mr. Krabs' first dollar. The grandfather clock coo-coos three times. Mr. Krabs hiding under a footrest. But Pearl's tears destroy it. Mr. Krabs cowers himself from the tears.]
Mr. Krabs: Whew. [his pants rip off] Hmm? [sees his butt showing] Ahh! [covers his ripped pants with tape] There, there, me little beluga. It'll be okay. I hired Mr. Squidward to babysit just like when you were little.
[Pictures of Squidward babysitting Pearl are shown. The first one shows Squidward pushing baby Pearl in her cradle. The second one shows baby Pearl crying while flooding the house and Squidward swimming for his life. And the third one shows Squidward holding baby Pearl in his lap.]
Pearl: Ew, Dad! Squidward is so lame.
Mr. Krabs: Lame, schmame. You and Squidward will have so much fun, you won't want to go anywhere. But just in case. [pushes the button and barricades the doors and windows with prison bars] You won't be able to go anywhere! [cackles until he hears a knock at the door] Oh, just in time.
[Squidward is knocking on the door with a confident smile. He looks at the door and wonders why it's barricaded. Just then, Mr. Krabs answers the door.]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! Thanks for keeping an eye on me little Pearl tonight.
Squidward: No problem.
Mr. Krabs: Remember our deal, Squidward. Keep Pearl out of trouble and I'll give you one shift a week without SpongeBob. But if anything happens to my little angel...
[Mr. Krabs pulls SpongeBob out from his pocket. SpongeBob laughs and makes crazy, but creepy faces at Squidward.]
Squidward: No! Please! Anything but that! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs puts SpongeBob back in his pocket] You can count on me.
Mr. Krabs: I knew I could. [gets into his boat and drives away]
Squidward: Whew!
Pearl: Oh, thanks for watching the house tonight, Squidward. I'll be back late. So, you know, don't wait up for [gets snagged by a fishing hook] me!
Squidward: [grunts as he struggles to reel Pearl back] Your dad said we have to stay in tonight! [grunts] But that doesn't mean we can't have [grunts] fun!
[Pearl flops around like a fish and Squidward drags her back in the house. The scene changes to Squidward and Pearl sitting at a table together.]
Squidward: [digs through his backpack] Look. [takes out a whale-shaped doll] We can play with this setaceous Sally doll. [takes out crayons and a coloring book] Or we could color this princess coloring book. [holds up a tape cassette] Or we could sing along with—Ahh!
[Squidward notices that Pearl is gone and sees the ripped up doll on the floor.]
Squidward: Uh, Sally!
[Squidward goes to look for Pearl and sees the coloring book and crayons on the floor.]
Squidward: [picks up the book, looks in it, and screams] Outside the lines! [drops the book]
[Squidward rushes upstairs and goes to Pearl's bedroom door.]
Squidward: [knocks on the door] Pearl? [peaks in] Hello? [goes in her room and sees Pearl ripped wall paper and posters as if she is secretly making piñatas] Hmm, hey, uh, Pearl. Um, whatcha' up to?
Pearl: Arts and crafts!
Squidward: Hey, I dabble in the arts myself. Maybe I can help.
[Pearl turns one of her crafts around and reveals the words ""R.I.P Squidward"" with skull and cross bones.]
Squidward: [freaks out] Uh, never mind. Uh, you seem to have that under control. I'll just, um, be out here if you need me. Or not. Definitely not. [leaves Pearl's room and sits on a chair] That is one morbid teen.
Pearl: That outta keep him out of my hair.
[Pearl hears a horn honking outside the house. She opens the curtains and sees Dylan parked outside waiting for her. Dylan picks his teeth with a toothpick and looks at his watch. Dylan honks the horn again.]
Pearl: It's go-time!
[Pearl takes out her little mirror fluffs her ponytail and takes a look from outside her room. She sees Squidward sound asleep near the door. She goes to put her craft-shaped head on the bed to fool Squidward. She lifts her Boys Who Cry poster, drills a hole through the wall with her tears and sneaks into the wall. She climbs down through the wall and comes out from below the house. She accidentally slams the house really hard and wakes up Squidward.]
Squidward: [screams] Oh. [gets up] What's happening? [opens her bedroom door] Pearl? Oh. You asleep? Aw, she must've tuckered herself out.
[Squidward taps on the Pearl's head-shaped craft and it slides off the bed.]
Squidward: [screams] Oh, no! Maybe if we get it on ice, then can reattach it— [backs into the wall where Pearl made the home to escape] Ahh!
[Squidward falls through the wall of the house and landed near the bottom of the front door. He digs himself underneath and comes out of the ground with the craft on his head. He pokes his eyes and mouth through the craft when he sees Pearl about to drive away with Dylan.]
Squidward: Huh?
Pearl: Oh, thanks for the ride, Dylan.
Dylan: No prob.
[Dylan drives away with Pearl. Squidward breaks free from the ground and clutches his head.]
Squidward: She's gone! Krabs is gonna kill me!
[Squidward rushes to his recumbent bicycle. He pumps air in the back tire, puts on elbow pads and a helmet. He checks the tire and adds more air in it. He puts the air pump in the basket and hastily hops on the bike. He looks both ways and goes after Pearl. Meanwhile, Dylan is driving past a sign that says, ""surface.""]
Pearl: Um, that sign said ""surface."" Are you sure this is the way? [giggles]
Dylan: For sure, babe. We're going to a breach party.
Pearl: Oh, I've never been to one of those before. Sounds exciting.
[Dylan hits the accelerator and quickly drives the boat up a high cliff.]
Dylan: Whoo!
[Meanwhile, Squidward is riding his bike trying to look for Pearl.]
Squidward: Hmm. Mm-hmm. [stops and picks up some dirt] Hmm. Still warm. [sees the sign that says ""surface""] The surface, eh? That SpongeBob-free shift will be mine! [He starts to go up the high cliff, but only gets a few hundred yards before his legs start to buckle. He slips back down but he doesn't dare let his bike reach the bottom. Groaning, he keeps biking up that vertical stretch of road] SpongeBob-shift— [grunts] mine!
[At the breach party near the surface, the party goers are having a great time. Some are watching television, eating pizza and drinking soda. Pearl, Dylan and other teenagers are roasting marshmallows over a hydrothermal vent. Pearl munches on the marshmallow on Dylan's narwhal tooth.]
Pearl: Mmm! Oh-ho, Dylan.
[Several teens are having a breaching contest by chugging down soda and jumping to the surface. One teen chugs down some of the soda.]
Teens: [chanting] Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
[The teen stops chugging and a bigger teen shakes him up to have him breach the surface.]
Teens: [chanting] Breach! Breach! Breach! Breach! Breach! Breach!
[The small teen floats to the surface and burps. Then he falls back down in the water.]
Teens: Whoo-hoo!
[Pearl, Dylan and the other teens dance to the music on the radio. Moments later, Squidward makes it up the cliff and his completely exhausted.]
Squidward: Pearl!
Teens: [stop dancing and gasp] Huh? What? [A goth girl raises an eyebrow and gives a withering look that would make Squidward look like an amateur]
Squidward: You have to come home right away! We can do whatever you want if we go back now! I'll even play us some jazz! [pulls out his clarinet] Kids love jazz!
[Squidward attempts to play music on his clarinet, but his lousy music makes Pearl, Dylan, and the party goers cringe.]
Squidward: ♪Come on, Pearl. Let's go home. I can't be here all alone.  Let's get back, before we're dead. [one teen covers his face with his hood and another hides in the beach umbrella] Skiddle-bobba-doo-diddle-bop-bop, yeah!♪
[Squidward's ""jazzy"" music creates agony to the teens.]
Teen #1: No! Jazz making me nerdier! [his face grows pimples, his arms grow smaller and his shirt changes from ""cool"" to ""school""]
[One teen grows braces and his clothing turns into band clothes. Another teen's sunglasses becomes reading glasses. Pearl and Dylan cover their ears from Squidward's music.]
Pearl: Oh, this is so embarrassing!
Dylan: Forget him, Pearl. Let's breach.
[Dylan leads Pearl away from Squidward and goes to the breaching competition of the party. One teen breaches upward over the surface and comes back down into the water.]
Teens: Yeah! [gives high-fives to each other] Yeah! Yes! Yeah!
Pearl: Uh, I don't know. Is it dangerous?
Dylan: Uh-uh, babe. It's nautical. [waves his hair]
[Pearl gasps and giggles.]
Squidward: Pearl! What about yo-yos? Kids love yo-yos! [gets tangled up in the yo-yos]
Pearl: Okay, let's do it! One, two, three, [breaches up really high over the surface] yahoo! This is so coral! [falls and ends up beached on Bikini Atoll's shore; she gasps and flops around] Dylan, help! This isn't nautical!
[The teens see Pearl's feet dangling at the surface.]
Teen #2: Oh, man! She's beached!
Dylan: We're gonna be in so much trouble!
Teen #3: Leave her! Let's cheese it!
Teen #4: Let's get out of here!
[Dylan and the teens ditch Pearl and leave.]
Pearl: [continues to flop around] Oh, no!
Squidward: Pearl, are you alright?
Pearl: Oh, Squidward, I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you.
Squidward: It's okay! Let's just get you outta' here.
[Squidward grabs Pearl's feet and struggles to pull her back down. But he ends up pulling her shoes off and he goes flying backwards. He tries pulling her again, but ends up tearing his own arms off.]
Squidward: Okay, okay, just hold on a second! [runs off]
Pearl: Hold on? What are you—Ahh!
[Squidward plugs her blowhole with the air pump. He pumps air through Pearl's blowhole, making her inflate like a balloon. Pearl floats up high in the air. Squidward pulls the air pump out of Pearl's blowhole.]
Pearl: Huh?
[Pearl flies around all over the sky until she runs out of air. She falls back down into the water and lands gently into Squidward's bike. The party is completely trashed and all of the party goers including Dylan are gone.]
Pearl: [tears up and starts bawling] I can't believe Dylan ditched me! My life is over!
Squidward: Oh, I don't think it's that bad.
[Pearl bawls a fountain of tears. The tears rip of some of the leave of Bikini Atolls palm trees, scaring several seagulls in the process. Squidward cowers himself in fear.]
Squidward: I'll, um, just get you home.
[Squidward struggles to paddle his bike to bring Pearl home.]
French Narrator: Many, many minutes later...
[Squidward manages to bring Pearl home after a really long and exhausting ride. The bike's tires break into pieces and Pearl gets off to go in the house.]
Pearl: [sighs] Guess I'll just wait for my dad to get home.
Squidward: You know, there is a way we can still have a little fun tonight.
Pearl: Really?
[The scene changes to Pearl and Squidward running up to Dylan's house with a bag. Pearl rings the doorbell and she and Squidward hide behind Dylan's boat.]
Dylan: [answers the door] Like, hello?
[Dylan sees the bag and picks it up. He goes to look in the bag. When suddenly, the bag explodes, revealing SpongeBob inside. SpongeBob laughs and makes the same crazy and creepy faces from before. Dylan screams in horror and runs away. SpongeBob then chases after Dylan. Squidward and Pearl both laugh now that their revenge against Dylan is final, thus ending the episode.]",1.59,Andrew Goodman

Squidward comes outside to find Patrick with no customers, because his jugs are just water. Squidward decides to give Patrick old, rotten lemons, which make his eye red, and also cause his first customer to get sick. Eventually, Patrick decides to replace the lemons with the contents of a toy firetruck, however SpongeBob joins in with Patrick and yells in a megaphone, scaring Squidward and spraying ink out of his nose. Patrick finds this liquid and SpongeBob decides to drink it. SpongeBob gets sick at first but eventually finds it delicious. As customers starts to line up for black lemonade, Patrick has to get more ink.Squidward doesn't want to give anymore ink to Patrick, so Patrick resorts to scaring Squidward, including revealing his inner organs and letting a sea spider named Mildred enter Squidward's house. Squidward sprays a lot of ink out of his nose and Patrick gives the black lemonade to the stand.Squidward, now paranoid, thinks about what could possibly happen to him next, and therefore starts to act crazy. Patrick's final plan is to create a haunted area in front of Squidward's house. As Squidward goes into the haunted area, it causes the now paranoid Squidward to spray lots of ink into a few vases and cups. Eventually, he runs out of the haunted zone and finds out that SpongeBob and Patrick were using his ink to sell lemonade the whole time. Squidward starts to get upset at Patrick and SpongeBob, however he comes up with a plan - opening his own black lemonade stand for himself.Unfortunately, Squidward is unable to make more lemonade, so he chooses to have a customer scare him in order to get lemonade. Don the Whale does, and Squidward sprays ink like crazy over the customers. Eventually the customers find out the ""source"" and puke in Squidward's house. SpongeBob and Patrick also moved out of the lemonade business to sell cookies. As Squidward eats one of them, SpongeBob and Patrick say they used spider eggs as chips, resulting in Squidward literally screaming out spiders and spraying ink, as the episode ends.",Ink Lemonade,"[The episode begins with Patrick riding on his chair at the lemonade stand until he stops.]
Patrick: [laughing] Lemonade! Lemonade for sale! [giggles]
[Squidward comes out carrying a bag of trash and goes to put it near the curb. Patrick waves at Squidward in a goofy fashion.]
Squidward: Yuck.
[Patrick points on the pitcher and Squidward growls angrily. Patrick drinks the water and eats the glass.]
Squidward: [groans] What are you doing out here in the daylight? You should be hidden under your rock like the hideous freak you are. Do you even have a license to sell... [notices the glasses of water] just what are you selling?
Patrick: [yells through megaphone] Lemonade!
Squidward: [pulls his nose and eyes back out from his head] Thanks for reminding me why I hate you. Lemonade? I don't see any lemons.
Patrick: [silent] I need lemons?
Squidward: [takes out a rotten lemon and throws it in Patrick's eye] Here. Don't say I never gave you anything. [Patrick's eye burns] Sorry it's a little bruised. [laughs]
[Patrick lifts up his left arm, pulls out a bandage from his armpit and puts it on the rotten lemon.]
Patrick: All better. [puts the rotten lemon in the pitcher full of water]
Squidward: Yuck.
[The scene changes to Squidward shaving the hair out of his nostrils with the razor. Patrick is still sitting outside at his lemonade stand with the rotten lemon in the pitcher.]
Patrick: [yells through two megaphones] Lemonade!
[Patrick's loud outburst startles Squidward. The razor buzzes around in his nostrils and Squidward screams in all directions of his bathroom. The plug comes out and Squidward falls on the floor. Outside, Cara drinks the pitcher of Patrick's ""lemonade.""]
Incidental 69: [after drinking the pitcher] Ahh! Thanks, buddy. I was thirsty. [gags and sticks his tongue out with the bandage on it]
Patrick: Oh! [removes the bandage from Cara's tongue]
Incidental 69: Huh?
Patrick: [puts the bandage back on his armpit] Sorry, that's not included.
Incidental 69: [gags] I'm gonna be sick! Where can I go? [covers his mouth]
Patrick: I always go in there.
[Incidental 69 runs up to the front door, opens it and throws up inside Squidward's house. Cara then closes the door and leaves. Squidward comes out, slipping onto the path of his front door. He growls angrily and stomps over to Patrick, who is holding a firetruck toy.]
Squidward: What are you doing?
Patrick: Oh, I ran out of lemons, so I'm squeezing this.
Squidward: That won't work!
[Patrick squeezes the red paint out from the firetruck toy.]
Squidward: Hmm? Wha...
Patrick: It could use more fire hose.
SpongeBob: [sneaks up behind Squidward and screams through megaphone] One fire truck lemonade!
[Squidward screams and sprays ink out from his nose into the pitcher. Squidward panics and rushes into his house. SpongeBob pulls the megaphone off his face and Patrick gives him a cup of Squidward's ink.]
Patrick: Here you go.
SpongeBob: Yum!
[SpongeBob drinks the ink. He gasps and shrieks while distorting his face. He stops and stares in silence for a bit.]
SpongeBob: [his mouth, tongue, and teeth are all black] That's delicious!
Incidental 167: Hello! What are you selling?
Patrick: [yells through megaphone] Lemonade!
SpongeBob: [yells through megaphone] Black lemonade!
[Patrick gives Incidental 167 a glass of black lemonade. She drinks it and, just like what happened to SpongeBob, she gasps and shrieks. She goes up and goes back down. She shrinks and disappears. She reappears blowing fire out from her mouth. She stops and exhales deeply until she calms down.]
Incidental 167: [yells through megaphone] Black lemonade! A unique taste sensation! I'll have another. [slurps]
[Patrick goes to give some more to the lady, but the pitcher is empty.]
Patrick: Huh? SpongeBob, cover for me while I go get some more.
SpongeBob: Sure, buddy.
[Patrick grabs the pitcher, goes to the front door of Squidward's house and knocks on it. Squidward answers it with his nose clogged up with tissues.]
Squidward: What do you want?
Patrick: Hi! Uh, yeah, I want you to do that scared thing you did and make more ink.
Squidward: I will not! [slams the door]
Patrick: Huh?
[Patrick groans as he thinks. Inside his body, a smaller version of himself goes up to his brain and rings the bell, giving him an idea.]
Patrick: I'll just have to scare the ink out of him! [rips his skin to show his jaw, trachea, heart, lungs, and intestines and knocks on the door]
Squidward: [answers the door] I said I will not— [gasps]
Patrick's intestine: May I borrow a cup of squid squeezings?
[Patrick's appearance scares Squidward out of his wits. As he screams, he sprays more ink from his nose and into the pitcher until it is full.]
Patrick: [laughs] Thank you!
[Patrick runs back to the lemonade stand and gives SpongeBob the pitcher of Squidward's ink.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, I think you'd better get some more black lemonade, buddy. [gives Patrick two empty pitchers]
Patrick: Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, more.
[The scene changes to Patrick at Squidward's front door.]
Patrick: Here, kitty kitty. Oh, here, kitty kitty. Oh, who's a good kitty?
[A giant red sea spider comes crawling by. Patrick opens the door and makes it wide enough for the spider to enter. Squidward is sitting on the couch listening to music on the phonograph. He goes to put another record on the phonograph. While doing so, the spider takes the record and Squidward puts its claw on the other record. The spider's claw makes the record sound terrible.]
Squidward: Huh? Hmm? [looks up and sees the giant spider; he screams] I hate spiders!
[Squidward sprays ink out of his nose again. The ink sprays into Patrick's pitchers until they're full. Squidward climbs up the wall and crawls through the hole on the ceiling. He sprays more ink out from his nose and fills two more of Patrick's pitchers.]
Patrick: [on the spider's head; clicks his tongue] Hyah!
[Squidward cowers behind a chair and whimpers.]
Patrick: [slides off the spider's back] Boo.
[Squidward screams and sprays more ink out from his nose, filling two more of Patrick's pitchers. Squidward hides on top of his kitchen cabinets. The spider looms in on Squidward and makes him spray more ink, filling up two more of Patrick's pitchers.]
Patrick: Thank you!
Squidward: Please! No!
[Patrick closes the door and goes to the lemonade stand. He gives the pitchers to SpongeBob.]
Patrick: Oh? [sees a long line of customers] Oh... What? I got to get more black lemonade!
[The scene changes back inside Squidward's house. The kitchen is a complete mess from all of the ink. Squidward comes out from the sink drain and looks around. He hears a sound and hides again. This time, he comes out from the bottom cabinets.]
Squidward: Is it gone? [hears a clanging sound] What was that? Is someone there? [grabs a pan] Hello? Who is it? [hears the doorbell ring and hides under the rug]
[Squidward peeks out from under the rug. Patrick continues to ring the bell. Squidward tiptoes to the door and slowly answers the door.]
Squidward: Hello?
[The door slams itself shut, leaving Squidward locked outside. Squidward tries to open it to go back in, but it wouldn't budge. The lights turn on. Squidward turns around and finds himself in a haunted themed area made by Patrick himself.]
Squidward: [whimpering] I've lost it. I can't tell what's real anymore!
[Patrick scares Squidward with a toy worm and a toy snail under his feet. The toy snail makes Squidward flip over and fall on the ground.]
Patrick: Boo! I'm a haunted... [swings over Squidward with a tablecloth over his body] tablecloth!
[Squidward screams a sprays more ink out from his nose. The ink fills several cups, pitchers, bowls, and pails laid out by Patrick. Patrick swings himself into a wall and laughs. Squidward runs up the stairs while spraying ink in more cups and bowls laid out by Patrick. He runs into a spooky baby's room with creepy music playing in the background.]
Squidward: Not creepy nursery rhyme music!
[Squidward hears a creaking sound in the crib behind him. He looks in the crib and sees Patrick wearing a creepy baby costume while having a nose similar to Squidward's.]
Patrick: Dada!
[Squidward screams and sprays more ink out from his nose into the crib. Squidward runs out through the window.]
Patrick: [puts the sucker back on the baby bottle filled with ink] Thank you, Daddy!
[Squidward falls to the ground and sees a spooky but crudely version of the Krusty Krab in front of him.]
Squidward: The Krusty Krab? How did I wind up here? I don't think I want to go in. [a newspaper falls on him; he gasps as he reads it] This newspaper is dated 60 years into the future.
[The conveyor belt underneath him moves and it takes him inside.]
Squidward: [covers his eyes] I can't look! I'm afraid to see. Please, no.
[Squidward looks up and sees a puppet version of his old futuristic self in his workstation.]
Puppet Squidward: May I help you, young man?
[Squidward's nose becomes a faucet and he screams the ink out of himself. Patrick, who is operating the old Squidward puppet, watches down happily. Squidward has had enough of the haunted area and goes to run away. He runs out of the haunted area and bumps into Incidental 32 at the lemonade stand.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, if you want to buy some black lemonade, you'll have to get in the back of the line.
Patrick: [comes out with a boat load of Squidward's ink] Yeah, wait your turn like everybody else.
Squidward: What? Black lemonade? You've been selling this as a refreshment?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [yells through megaphones] Yes!
Incidental 32: [pushes Squidward] Hey, come on, buddy. No cutting. We've been waiting here all day.
[The crowd complain and Squidward sees a really long line of customers.]
Fish: Think they can just walk right up!
Squidward: You mean you people actually drink this?
[The crowd murmurs in agreement.]
Squidward: Huh? Huh? [smiles evilly and gets an idea] Huh! [grabs a megaphone and speaks into it] What if I told you you can buy black lemonade straight from the source?
Incidental 32: Source? We love the source!
[The crowd murmurs in agreement. Squidward takes out a really big fan and blows SpongeBob, Patrick, the boat load of ink, and the lemonade stand away.]
SpongeBob: Whoa!
[Squidward forms his own stand and calls it ""Squidward's black lemonade."" The customers line up.]
Incidental 32: Uh, okay. So where's our black lemonade?
Squidward: Yes, of course. Coming right up. [attempts to spray more ink out from his nose, but nothing happens] Huh? [pokes his nose and blows it; he chuckles] Don't worry. I'll—I'll make some more. I just need a little recovery time. [wrings out his nose and blows it, only to blow out the inside of his nostrils]
Incidental 42: Say, uh, buddy, you all right?
Squidward: [chuckles] I'm fine!
Incidental 42: Well, then, make with my black lemonade!
Squidward: Uh, can somebody please scare me?
Don the Whale: [grabs Squidward by the neck] Oh, I'll do better than that, jack! [goes to punch Squidward]
[Squidward screams and sprays ink out from his nose onto Don's face. Squidward then sprays ink over the heads of the long line of customers. The customers gasp in shock and moan in disgust when they see that black lemonade was actually made out of Squidward's ink. Squidward stops spraying the ink and goes back to the his lemonade stand.]
Squidward: Black lemonade.
Incidental 69: [grossed out] Oh... is that what black lemonade is? [gags]
[The customers are completely grossed out. They trample onto Squidward and destroy the stand. Then they run into Squidward's house and throw up inside.]
Squidward: I don't get it. I thought they wanted...
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick are wearing gloves and aprons while holding trays of cookies] Hey, Squidward! You'll be happy to hear we're out of the black lemonade business. We found something new.
Patrick: Yeah, it's all yours, buddy. Homemade cookies.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [whispers] Yay.
Squidward: Huh. You know, a—a homemade cookie is just the kind of comfort food I could use right now. Thanks. [takes a cookie and eats it] Hey, these cookies are delicious! What's in them?
Patrick: Spider eggs!
SpongeBob: Yeah, say hello to our new partner. [shows the giant red spider to Squidward] Mildred, you've met Squidward.
[Squidward screams as Mildred's babies crawl out of his mouth and sprays more ink out from his nose, blackening the screen and ending the episode.]",1.31,Kaz

This leads to Mr. Krabs tasking SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward to go to the Mustard Mine to get more mustard. An old man named Walter Haddock comes to warn the Krusty Krew about the mines being haunted by a mummy, but they proceed to go anyways.The three find the Mustard Mine and start looking for mustard. While SpongeBob and Patrick share singing, they jump on the top and bottom until the rocks block the entrance. Now the three are trapped, much to Patrick's horror who faints. SpongeBob makes him a Krabby Patty to let him recover, but there's no mustard. They find an escalator that takes them down to where all the minerals are, but everything in the mines is not what they are looking for. Squidward finds a train station that will take them to the condiments section of the mines and quickly gets in there with SpongeBob and Patrick already in the train before it closes.After leaving the train station, the three find several condiments inside the rocks before eventually finding mustard underneath the ground. While they are trying to open up the hole to get the mustard, Walter Haddock appears again and plugs the hole. He then warns them if they mine the mustard, it will explode due to the immense amount of pressure inside of it, and made up the mummy story to keep them from looking for the mustard.SpongeBob is saddened by these events and begins to cry thinking he will have to find another job. However, Squidward believes Walter wants the mustard for himself and tries to fight with him. Patrick also fights with him, thinking the game is about not hurting the attacker. Walter Haddock punches Patrick and he lands on the mustard hole, causing the pressure to build up so much that the mustard explodes out of the mines to the Krusty Krab. This floods the restaurant with mustard, ending the episode with the customers satisfied, except for a mummy who complains about a lack of relish.",Mustard O' Mine,"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. A mother and a baby passes by and is greeted by a polite gentleman. A raspberry noise is heard. The mother turns and gives the gentleman an angry look, thinking it was him who made the noise. The noise is heard again. They turn and see a long line standing in the Krusty Krab. It turns out to be Mustard Day and SpongeBob is giving away mustard to the customers.]
SpongeBob: Mustard, mustard, step right up for your mustard! [flips the mustard container] Some mustard for you. Eh, eh, eh. [sprays mustard on a little boy's Krabby Patty]
[The mustard forms into a t-rex and it roars mustard in the boy's face.]
Boy: [his face is covered in mustard] Cool!
SpongeBob: [flips the mustard container] A bit of the yellow for you. Doy. [sprays mustard on Frankie Billy's Krabby Patty]
[The mustard forms into a sailboat. It whistles and rings its foghorn before it melts onto the patty. Frankie Billy laughs and skips away. Nancy Suzy Fish comes up and whispers something in SpongeBob's ear.]
SpongeBob: Oh, okay. [winks at Nancy Suzy Fish] Eh. [hops and spins the mustard container before spraying the mustard into a handsome man] And a Mr. Mustard for you.
Nancy Suzy Fish: [purrs as walks with her Mr. Mustard while licking him] Mmm, yummy.
SpongeBob: Hyah! [attempts to give mustard to Frank, but the mustard container is all out and it cough out a small drop of mustard]
Customers: Aw.
SpongeBob: Hang on, folks, I'll be right back with more mustard. [hops on the mustard container and drives on it like a car] Whoo! [drives to the kitchen and goes to the condiment cabinet] Let's see. Ketchup. [slides ketchup door to mayonnaise door] Mayonnaise. [rolls up mayonnaise door to mustard door] Oh, mustard. [opens doors mustard door to find Mr. Krabs in it]
Mr. Krabs: Did you use up all me mustard?
SpongeBob: [stammering nervously] What?
Squidward: [filing his tentacle] Oh, who gives a flying fish about mustard?
SpongeBob: [gasps] But Squidward, without mustard I wouldn't be able to make a—
Mr. Krabs: Krabby Patty! That's right, you're both hereby ordered to go down into the mustard mines! And bring me back more mustard!
Squidward: Mustard mines?
Patrick: [comes out of the condiment cabinet and is covered with mustard] Mmm, mustard. [takes a container off his head and grabs a packet of mustard] Uh... Ah. [squirts mustard in his mouth, eats it and burps]
Mr. Krabs: [wipes mustard off his face] And you are going down to the mustard mines too.
Walter Haddock: [offscreen] I wouldn't do that if I was you. [creepily comes in and spits on the grill]
[SpongeBob wipes the grill clean.]
Walter Haddock: That old mustard mine is cursed.
SpongeBob: [hugs Mr. Krabs in fear] Cursed?
Mr. Krabs: [pushes SpongeBob away] What kind of curse?
Walter Haddock: It's, uh, er, one of those—The Mummy's Curse.
Mr. Krabs: [snickers] There's no such thing as mummies.
Walter Haddock: [holds up a creepy picture of his mother] We've all got mummies. Eh? [giggles] Mm-hmm. I've been in that mine. No one that enters gets out alive. [makes a creepy smile as a shrieking noise is heard; a spider crawls into his mouth and thunder claps]
SpongeBob: You got out and you're alive.
Walter Haddock: Ah, but am I?
Patrick: Yeah, you're standing right there.
Walter Haddock: But am I? [walks away in a creepy fashion]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, you're right— [notices that he's gone, but he sees his foot] Hmm.
Squidward: I see your foot.
Walter Haddock: [slides his foot back] No, you don't.
SpongeBob: Ah, his foot's gone!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward at the entrance to the mustard mines.]
Squidward: [looks at the map] This map doesn't show us where the mustard vein is located. Well, let's just start picking.
Patrick: [picking his nose] Way ahead of you, pal.
Squidward: Ugh. [turns and looks at the map again]
[Patrick reaches into his nostril and picks out his brain.]
Patrick: Ooh. [smears his brain on Squidward's shirt]
[Squidward turns and grunts in disgust. Patrick gets scared and runs over to SpongeBob. Squidward picks up his pickaxe and heads into the mustard mines.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [gasp and skip into the mines] ♪ Oh, a-mining we will go! The mustard, it will flow! ♪ [bounce up and down really hard] ♪ With pick and axe without the facts! There's nothing that we know! Ta-da! ♪
[SpongeBob and Patrick's violent bouncing causes a landslide and falling rocks seals off the entrance, much to their horror.]
Squidward: [Shocked and angry] Huh?! You nitwits! How will we get out now?!
[SpongeBob and Patrick's realize their mistake as Patrick gets worried.]
Patrick: Ah, we're trapped in a mine! We'll never get out!
[Patrick goes into frantic panic and runs up and down the mine walls. He curls in a fetal position and acts crazy. He punches his chest and passes out.]
Squidward: [sighs and goes to check on Patrick] Krabby Patty, stat.
[SpongeBob takes out the ingredients and makes a perfect Krabby Patty. He gives it to Squidward and he feeds Patrick the patty. Patrick swallows the patty and slowly wakes up.]
Squidward: He's coming 'round.
Patrick: [weakly] Squidward. I—I need—
Squidward: What can I get for you?
Patrick: [pulls out the Krabby Patty from his mouth and stupidly] I need a little mustard for the Krabby Patty.
Squidward: [drops Patrick down in disgust at his idiocy] Why do I even bother? Maybe there's a back door.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hey, wait for us!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run over to Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Whoa.
[They stop at a long, deep shaft.]
Squidward: I wonder how deep it is.
SpongeBob: I'll check. [picks up a pebble, goes over the edge and falls into the shaft] Wahhh! [appears next to Squidward and Patrick] Don't bother jumping. That shaft has no bottom. Let's take the escalator.
Squidward: [pushes SpongeBob and Patrick aside] All right, spread out! [goes on the escalator]
[SpongeBob and Patrick follow and go on the escalator with Squidward. They see coal miners go up the escalator.]
SpongeBob: Coal miners.
[They see sulfur miners go up the escalator. The awful smell from the sulfur makes SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward cover their noses.]
SpongeBob: Ew.
Patrick: Sulfur miners.
SpongeBob: Phew.
[They see a group of kids go up the escalator.]
SpongeBob: Unaccompanied minors. [drum sting]
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward walk off the escalator.]
Squidward: All right, let's get to work, chowderheads.
[They go in separate directions while bumping into each other for a little bit. SpongeBob digs up a yellow rock with his pickaxe.]
SpongeBob: Hey, I found something yellow. [pulls the yellow rock out of the wall; he was happy at first, but turned sad] Never mind, it's just gold. [throws it away]
Patrick: All I'm getting is dumb old diamonds. [throws and kicks several diamonds]
SpongeBob: [carrying a handful of gold nuggets] This must be the Mummy's Curse that old guy was talking about. [throws the gold nuggets in the stalagmite]
Squidward: Gold and diamonds? [digs up sand from the wall] Gold dust! No, no, it's just sand.
[Up above the surface, Ryan is minding his own business playing in the sandbox. Suddenly, the sand begins to form a whirlpool and sucks Ryan down underneath.]
Ryan: Whoa! [screaming]
[Ryan comes out from the hole Squidward dug up and he runs around in panic.]
Squidward: [upon seeing Ryan] Ah.
[Ryan continues to run and scream in panic until he calms down when he goes up the escalator.]
Squidward: Uh, what was that?
SpongeBob: [sighs] The greatest treasure of all, a child.
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward resume their task. All of a sudden, SpongeBob begins to sniff out something. He sniffs the wall and punctures a hole on it with the pickaxe. It turns out that he dug up a payphone underneath the wall. The phone rings and SpongeBob answers it.]
SpongeBob: Hello?
Mr. Krabs: [with angry customers yelling in the background] SpongeBob, where's me mustard?
Jennifer Millie: I want some mus— [Mr. Krabs pushes her away with his foot]
SpongeBob: On the way, sir, as soon was we find it. [hangs up but answers again] Love you. [hangs up again]
Squidward: Oh, we'll never find that mustard vein. [pokes the wall with the pickaxe and the wall crumbles into a hole, leading him to the subway] Oh, what is this? [wonders around the subway]
Subway PA: Local train approaching station.
[Deep in the tunnel, a train emerges and stops in front of Squidward. The train opens its doors, revealing SpongeBob and Patrick already on board. Squidward stares at them in shock, wondering how they managed to get on so quick and afford a train ride.]
SpongeBob: Hurry up, Squidward, before the doors close!
Patrick: It's the last train of the night!
SpongeBob: Do you have a metro card?
[Squidward frantically searches for a metro card until he finds one under his shirt.]
Squidward: Ah! I got it! [tries to scan his card, but the tumblers keep beeping red]
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward!
[Squidward tries all his might to scan his card as he watches the train doors slowly close in horror.]
Subway PA: Watch the closing doors.
[Squidward buffs up his arm and the tumbler finally turns green, approving access to it. Squidward runs through the tumblers and frantically heads to the train.]
SpongeBob: Faster, Squidward, faster!
[Squidward makes it, but the doors close on his neck, leaving his body being dragged outside of the moving train.]
Patrick: Hey, Squidward, you really should watch the closing doors.
[Squidward growls and hisses at Patrick in complete anger and frustration, as Patrick backs away.]
Subway PA: This is a local mining train making all stops between Coal and Limestone. Next stop, Condiments.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's our stop.
[The train stops at the condiments vein. The doors open. SpongeBob steps over a battened Squidward and heads to the condiments vein. Patrick runs out and steps on Squidward, but grabs him by the feet.]
Patrick: Come on, Squidward!
[SpongeBob and Patrick scurry into the condiments vein while Squidward, being carried by Patrick, hits his head on the sign. Patrick sets Squidward down. Squidward walks around in a dizzy fashion, but pulls himself together. Squidward knocks on the wall and punctures a hole with his pickaxe. Mayonnaise comes out of the wall and sprays into Squidward's face.]
Squidward: Hmm... [sticks out his tongue] Ah la hmm... [licks the mayo] Ah! I've struck mayo!
[SpongeBob punctures a hole on a different wall and a drop of hot sauce flies onto his tongue. He tastes the dropping and his body flares up, burning himself to a crisp.]
SpongeBob: Hot sauce! [his body crumbles into ashes]
[Patrick goes to puncture a wall with his pickaxe, but flips over and falls to the ground; his pickaxe punctures a hole on the wall and ketchup spews out.]
Patrick: I struck blood! [grabs some of the ketchup and tastes it] Oh, no, it's ketchup. [slurps some more]
SpongeBob: We're getting close. [punctures a hole on the ground and mustard comes out; he takes a sample of mustard] Oh. [licks the mustard] Mustard. Ahhh! I struck mustard!
Squidward: Mustard?!
Patrick: Mustard?!
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward: [dancing around in circles while twisting SpongeBob's body] ♪Look at all the mustard flow! Look at all the mustard flow! That golden yellow fatty acid treat!♪
[SpongeBob unravels himself, sending Squidward and Patrick flying to another wall. SpongeBob warms himself up and goes to crack open the ground again. But the ground was so thick that is disintegrates his pickaxe.]
SpongeBob: Oh no, what are we gonna do now?
Squidward: I think we better use our heads.
Patrick: Let's use my head! [pulls his tongue and his pointy head revs up like a power drill]
[SpongeBob and Squidward go to use Patrick's drilling head to drill a hole in the ground. When all of a sudden, they hear a moaning sound. Smoke fumes around the tunnels and a shadowy creature appears.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward: The mummy!
[The smoke clears and the shadowy figure reveals himself to be none other than the crazy old prospector, Walter Haddock.]
Walter Haddock: Stop!
[Walter Haddock leaps in front of SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward, pulls a cork out from his mouth and plugs up the hole in the ground.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] It's the Mummy's Curse guy!
Walter Haddock: There ain't no curse! I just tried to discourage you chuckleheads from mining this mustard!
SpongeBob: Oh, I get it, 'cause the mummy wants the mustard. Mystery solved.
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward: Hurrah!
Walter Haddock: [twitches his eye] 'Tain't no mummy! This mustard is sitting on top of 20 million pounds of pressure! If you open her up, she's gonna blow sky high!
SpongeBob: Oh, no curse. No mummy. And no mustard. [sniffs] And I'll have to find another job! [cries and blows his nose on Squidward's nose]
Squidward: [pulls his nose back] Stop. Don't you see? This old coot wants all the mustard for himself! Now uncork that mustard!
Walter Haddock: Hmm? [growls]
Squidward: Oh, put your fists down, old man. I'm not gonna hurt you.
Walter Haddock: Hyah! [punches Squidward in the face]
[Squidward falls over.]
SpongeBob: You were right, Squidward, you're not gonna hurt him.
Squidward: [gets up and is really angry] Why you— [gets punched in the face again] Ow! [gets punched again] I'm gonna— [gets punched and his head spins; then he gets punched again]
SpongeBob: Go, Squidward, you're winning! You're not hurting him at all!
Patrick: [buffs up] Let me try not hurting him. [grabs Squidward and throws him aside] Come on, old-timer! You know you want a piece of me! [Walter Haddock punches Patrick on the head and sends him flying and crashing onto the hole in the ground] Oh.
Walter Haddock: [in pain] Ow, that hurt!
Patrick: [Getting up] I hurt him! [Stupidly and disappointed] That means I lose.
[Suddenly, the ground underneath begins the shake, due to the force of Patrick's fall. Cracks begins to form and Walter Haddock dodges the incoming stalagmites from the ground. The mustard from underground begins to build up pressure and is about to erupt.]
SpongeBob: No no no no no no no! [tries to hold down the pressure, but the mustard begins to fill up inside his body] Whoa....!
Walter Haddock: Adiós, muchachos!
[Walter Haddock laughs manically and bounces around until he calms down when he goes up the escalator. Cracks form underneath Squidward and the crack uncovers a payphone next to him.]
Squidward: Hmm. [phone rings and he answers it] I'll get it. Hello.
Mr. Krabs: [on a mast above the angry customers] Where's me mustard?!
Squidward: Um...
[Pressure builds up as SpongeBob's body grows bigger and bigger from the upcoming mustard. Patrick tries his best by corking up the holes. At the Krusty Krab, the customers continue to riot against Mr. Krabs. One customer is chopping the mast down with his axe. The screen zooms out to reveal volcanic pocket of mustard underneath the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: Your mustard is coming right up.
Mr. Krabs: [as the mast falls] When?!
Squidward: Now?
[SpongeBob can't hold the pressure much longer as his eyes fill up with mustard. The ground under the Krusty Krab rumbles and erupts a geyser of mustard through the roof. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward bounce up and down on top of the geyser.]
SpongeBob: Wow! Yee-ha! Yeah!
[The mustard fills up the Krusty Krab inside. The customers are now satisfied and go to swim around in the mustard as well as eat their patties with mustard. Among them stands a mummy, who is unimpressed.]

He climbs on the ladder and rides around on it. He bumps into SpongeBob and lands on Gary's chair, scaring him. Gary angrily hisses at Patrick.]
SpongeBob: [straightens himself out] Oh, tender, naïve Patrick, it's not that kind of playground. It's a place to read books! See?
Patrick: Oh, I love books! [laughs and throws books around] Book! Book! [SpongeBob dodges the incoming books] Book!
SpongeBob: [whispers] Gary, I don't think Patrick knows how to use a book properly. [gets hit in the face by a book] Ow! [removes the book and grabs Patrick] Behold the books, Patrick. Each one has a story to tell.
Patrick: Whoa.
SpongeBob: Look out! Those books are cliffhangers, stories for the adventurous.

Patrick: Whoa! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [puts a book close to his ear] Listen to the soothing sounds of the audiobooks. [hears seagulls cawing and ocean waves] I can hear the ocean.

Patrick: Me too!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
SpongeBob: Cookbooks, for the culinarily curious.
[Patrick takes a page that has a picture of a turkey on it. He puts it on a stove, fries it up, and eats it.]
Patrick: I like the pictures.
SpongeBob: [reaches in Patrick's mouth and grabs the page] Ah, but the pictures are a mere snack! [closes the book and puts it away] It's the words in the book that really feeds your brain. Let's start you off with an old book.

SpongeBob: Then feast your eyes!
[SpongeBob turns the pages and Patrick goes to read. Inside Patrick's head, his brain is sitting alone on the couch, feeling bored. It picks its nose and smears it on the arm rest. It then sees Patrick looking at the words in the book he's reading.]

[While Patrick is reading, the words ""Once upon a time"" fly in through his eye sockets and pile up on his brain.]

SpongeBob: He likes it! Hey, Patrick!
[As Patrick continues to read, more words flow into his brain. The brain sniffs at the words and comes up with an idea. It gathers the words together and uses them to build a house. Once it's complete, it reads ""Home Sweet Home."" It enters its house, but more words pile up as Patrick continuously reads books. As Patrick continues to read, his head begins to swell up.]

SpongeBob: Wow, what a bookworm! [sees Patrick's swelled up head] Whoa.
Patrick: Yes, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick, I think that's enough knowledge for one day. Looks like you're full.
Patrick: Nonsense, dear boy. One can never accumulate too much information. [whips his face with a napkin] Ahem.
SpongeBob: Well, we're fresh out of books. Come on, I'll buy you an ice cream.
Patrick: Ah, I must confess to feeling more than slightly peckish.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm so proud of you! Ooh, you're a big brain now!
[Patrick attempts to leave, but his enormous head gets him stuck to the door.]
Patrick: Oh, skosh too big, it seems, eh, wha'?
SpongeBob: ""Eh, wha"" what?
Patrick: [laughs] Oh, no matter, my plebeian friend. I shall simply exit posthaste, posterior-first. [attempts to exit backwards, but ends up getting stuck]
SpongeBob: I got it. [pushes Patrick]
Patrick: Careful.
SpongeBob: Little bit... [pushes Patrick] Wow. You really got your melon jammed in there, didn't you?
Patrick: Oh, true, SpongeBob. Eh, but we can easily solve this problem on a quantum physics level. Take this down. If we reduce my subatomic particles by way of orbital electromagnetism, we'll create a harmonic oscillation within the molecules, resulting in a wave-function collapse, which will enable my ""melon,"" as you so drolly put it, to slip out.
[As Patrick spoke, simple mathematics appear from his head and swirl around SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Okay, sure. Let's give it a try. [puts various parts together and creates a machine; he stick the suction plugs on to Patrick's head; then he creates sound waves to help shrink Patrick's head, but the waves bounce back and hit Gary, causing him to shrink and multiply into little snails] Gary! Speak to me. Oh... [gathers the little snails and forms Gary back to his normal self] Oh, Gary you're back. I'd know that slime anywhere. [gasps] Slime! That's it! [laughs] Slime it up, Gar-bear.
[Gary slithers slime all over Patrick's head.]
Patrick: Abominable!
SpongeBob: Yeah, that Gary grease ought to do it. Okay, Patrick, pull yourself out.
[Patrick attempts to pull himself out, but with no success. SpongeBob tries to help him, but Patrick's swelled up head sends him flying into one of the bookshelves. SpongeBob sees a book about head-shrinking.]
SpongeBob: Hey. ""Head Shrinking for Beginners."" [reads book] Hm...
[The fireplace builds up the fire. SpongeBob, dressed as a witchdoctor, screams like a chicken. Gary plays the drums in rhythm. Patrick's head is covered in lite candles. SpongeBob chants and dances around like he's performing a ritual. He opens the bottle, drinks the potion and spits it in Patrick's face. But instead of shrinking Patrick's head, SpongeBob's head shrinks.]
SpongeBob: [high-pitched] Oh, I give up! I'll guess we'll have to live here in the library forever, Gary.
[Gary hides behind the drums in fear. SpongeBob cries a fountain of tears and his head goes back to normal.]
Patrick: SpongeBob, your typically moronic attempt has given me the solution! Perhaps because I had to smarten up to get stuck...
SpongeBob: You'll need to dumb down to get free!
Patrick: [laughs] Who's sporting the big brain now, hm? [laughs]
SpongeBob: All right, Patrick, let's get stupid! Yeah! [gives Patrick a tongue five]
[SpongeBob puts on gloves and goggles. Patrick kicks a book in SpongeBob's face.]
SpongeBob: Electronics.
[SpongeBob collects various pieces of parts and puts them all together to make a television set. Once he's done, he places it in front of Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Whew. I hope this works.
[Patrick sighs and SpongeBob turns on the television where the Sir Urchin and Snail Fail show is airing. Snail Fail hits Sir Urchin with a vase.]
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do? [hits the sea urchin with a shoe]
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do?
Patrick: I'm sorry, dear boy, but watching this mindless drivel isn't affecting me in the least... [gets dazed and starts to drool]
SpongeBob: We've got drool! Patrick, it's working! [holds up the television]
Snail Fail: What I do?
Patrick: [his eyeballs rub against the screen] This is insulting my intelligence. [begins to laugh] And I adore it! [laughs enthusiastically]
[Inside Patrick's head, Patrick's brain hears a loud noise. He turns and sees Sir Urchin and Snail Fail destroying everything it built.]
Snail Fail: What I do? [hits Sir Urchin with a word]
Sir Urchin: [throws a chunk] Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do? [hits Sir Urchin with a word]
[Patrick's brain runs to hide somewhere as Sir Urchin and Snail Fail destroy everything. Patrick's head shrinks down to its normal size.]
SpongeBob: We did it, Patrick! The mindless drivel is destroying your knowledge!
[SpongeBob plugs a hose in Patrick's head and sprays the words back into the books. He sprays the words onto the shelves and form brand new books for his library. The hose spits out the last remaining words and Patrick's brain.]
SpongeBob: Whoops. Here, Patrick. You may need this little fella. [puts his brain back into Patrick's head]
Patrick: Huh? Ah.
[Patrick's brain falls onto the couch in his head. It becomes bored again and picks its nose.]
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, this is where we came in. Ready for some ice cream?
Patrick: Boy, am I ever! [sees a book on the floor] A book? I love books! [goes back to throwing books] A book! [throws books] A book!
SpongeBob: [dodges the incoming books] That's right, Patrick. [dodges a book] Play nice with the pretty squares. Gary, this is really one for the books, eh? [laughs]
[Gary meows dully in response. SpongeBob laughs, but gets a book thrown in his mouth. He turns to the screen and laughs as he shows the cover of the book entitled, ""The End.""]",1.25,Doug Lawrence

Meanwhile, Plankton is using an invisibility helmet to steal the formula, and ends up doing so when Squidward accidentally throws it out due to SpongeBob mistakenly placing it in the trash. He goes back to the Chum Bucket to tell Karen this, and she becomes extremely happy.SpongeBob tries to look for the formula, but cannot find and Squidward tells him it was actually a trash can. SpongeBob and Squidward then look at the security footage to see what happened, and see that Plankton had stolen it. They devise a plan to steal the formula back, while Plankton fails to open the formula due to there being a 12-hour time lock.SpongeBob and Squidward go inside the Chum Bucket, right when Plankton finishes watching his show and goes to bed. After SpongeBob makes sure Plankton is asleep, they face many obstacles before eventually reaching the safe. However, whenever SpongeBob steps on a tile, he activates a trap which hurts Squidward. When they finally reach the safe, SpongeBob tries to take it, but this causes a rocket to take SpongeBob and Squidward and blast them outside of the restaurant.Mr. Krabs comes back to the Krusty Krab, where SpongeBob and Squidward tell him that Plankton stole the formula. He gets very mad, but ends up stealing the formula back very easily by punching a hole through the safe outside the restaurant. The episode ends with Plankton being mad that the formula is gone and instead has his pet Spot with a fuel rod, while Mr. Krabs puts SpongeBob and Squidward in his safe to further protect the formula.",Bottle Burglars,"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Squidward are cleaning Mr. Krabs' office.]
SpongeBob: [being used as a scrub brush to clean the window] Ooh— [gasps] Ooh— [gasps] Yeah! Don't you just love cleaning day?
Squidward: [wrings SpongeBob in the mop bucket] We're so lucky.
SpongeBob: Aww. Mr. Krabs' first dollar. [sprays the picture frame, pulls his face off and scrubs it clean before putting it back on; however, the dollar is reduced to two quarters] Whaa? [he sprays the picture frame again and scrubs it clean with his head; this time, it reduced into a penny] Huh? [he sprays the picture frame again and scrubs it clean with his back; this time, the picture frame is completely blank; SpongeBob takes out a dollar, licks it and pastes it onto the picture frame]
Mr. Krabs: Don't forget to clean the safe, boys. And keep your eyes on the Krabby Patty secret formula! [leaves]
Squidward: Hey, we need the combination!
SpongeBob: I got it covered. [turns the lock, goes to open it, but breaks his arm]
Squidward: Nyah!
SpongeBob: [hums as he pulls a piece of rolled-up paper from his broken arm] Doink! [snaps his arm back in place and chuckles as he reads the paper before turning the lock] Mm. Mm-hmm. [opens the safe] Voilà!
Squidward: [garbage falls out from the safe] Ahh—ooh! [pops out from the garbage]
SpongeBob: See? This is fun!
[Meanwhile, outside the Krusty Krab, Plankton is once again devising his latest scheme to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula.]
Plankton: [laughs and holds out a strange helmet] Krabs will never see me coming! Presso-inviso! [pushes the button on the helmet and his body turns invisible; he hums as he walks to the restaurant, but trips over] Ahh! Can't see my own feet.
[Back in the restaurant, SpongeBob is taking care of the secret formula like he's caring an infant.]
SpongeBob: [wraps a diaper around the bottle] Mm-hmm. [hums as puts the formula on a blanket and gives it a teddy bear and a baby bottle; then he wraps it with the blanket] Don't you go anywhere while I clean your homey-womey.
[As SpongeBob dusts the safe, Squidward dumps trash in the trashcan with the secret formula still inside. He then goes to dump it out through the window.]
Squidward: Out of sight... [Plankton laughs as he goes to the window] Out of my mind. [dumps the garbage on Plankton]
Plankton: [pops out from the garbage] Hey, watch it! [he sees the formula next to him and blubbers in surprise] Hommina—wah? The secret formula! Must be one of Krabs' tricks. [grabs the formula and makes a run for it] He'll pop out any second now. [stops in front of the Chum Bucket] Well?! [silence] Nothing. All right. [turns around and heads back in the Chum Bucket] I really did it! [goes to the kitchen where Karen is mixing chum with the grinder] Hey, Karen, guess what?! I finally got the Krabby Patty secret formula! How do you like me now?
Karen: [scans the bottle until her screen says, ""Secret Formula equals Genuine""] It's genuine. Come here, you big hunk of aquatic organism! Ooh, I knew you could do it! [hugs Plankton and kisses him] Just don't blow it this time.
[Meanwhile, back at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is finishing up cleaning the office. He notices the Krabby Patty formula is gone from the trashcan.]
SpongeBob: Oh! Oh! Ahh! [looks all over the office] Hey, Squidward, have you seen the Krabby Patty secret formula? [lifts the desk and drops it] Ohh! [pulls out from underneath] I put it right here in this circular file cabinet.
Squidward: That's a trash can, you nitwit. [SpongeBob looks at the item closer while Squidward sits back but suddenly what SpongeBob just said gets scared] The formula?! [cuts to them looking for the formula outside] Face it, SpongeBob. [gets trash thrown in his face] The formula—
SpongeBob: Don't say it!
Squidward: Is gone.
SpongeBob: [teary-eyed] Oh, I asked you not to say it... [unscrews his eyeballs and cries a fountain of tears] Why would you ever do that?
Squidward: [comforts SpongeBob] Come on. [throws him in through the window; cuts to them back in the office] Now let's see if the security cameras picked anything up. [pushes the button under Mr. Krabs' desk and a keyboard comes out] Hmm. [types on the keyboard and turns on the television while SpongeBob gasps in amazement]
Patrick: [on screen as he opens a trash can] Hi! I like to order—hmm—half a Krabby Patty, please! [digs in the trash can and pulls out a half-eaten Krabby Patty] Oh, thank you. [laughs then eats it]
[SpongeBob giggles and Squidward types on the keyboard to go to another footage. The footage shows Bubble Bass reading a Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy comic book while eating a Krabby Patty. Squidward pans out the footage, only to show that Bubble Bass is doing all this on the toilet in the bathroom. SpongeBob and Squidward both exclaim and groan in disgust. Squidward types on the keyboard and goes to the next footage. The footage shows the Krabby Patty formula outside the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Ah! It's alive!
Squidward: Hold on. [types the keyboard and zooms in on the footage to reveal Plankton holding the formula] Plankton?!
SpongeBob: Ahh! [his face falls off his body and falls over; he gasps] What are we gonna do?
Squidward: [grabs SpongeBob and breathes in and out of him like he's a paper bag.] Okay. All right. We'll just pretend everything's normal until closing time. Then we'll steal the formula back from Plankton! Yeah!
[Back at the Chum Bucket, Plankton is struggling to remove the cork from the bottle in hopes of reading the formula.]
Plankton: Come on! Open up! [tries to open it with his teeth but fails] Ahh! [tries to saw it open and stomp on it, but they also fail; posing as a genie from ""Spin the Bottle""] Open Sesame? [tries to burn it with a flamethrower, but it also fails as he ends up getting burned himself; he tries to blow it up with explosives, but it also fails as they blew up part of the Chum Bucket] It's no use, Karen. It won't budge.
Karen: Of course not, Einstein, it has a time lock. [points to time lock on the cork] It won't open until tomorrow morning.
Plankton: Well, I've waited this long. [opens the safe and puts the formula in it] What's a few more [closes the safe and talks loudly] excruciatingly long [calmly] hours? [turns the lock]
[It is now nighttime at the Krusty Krab and Mr. Krabs is locking the doors.]
SpongeBob: [nervously] Night, Mr. Krabs. Sleep tight.
Squidward: [nervously] Don't let the bed urchins bite.
Mr. Krabs: Eh, sure. You, too, you two. [climbs in his boat and drives away home while SpongeBob and Squidward laugh nervously as they wave good-bye]
Squidward: Okay, let's go get that formula.
SpongeBob: Ooh, we are gonna pull [imitates Plankton] a Plankton on Plankton! [laughs]
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Squidward sneaking behind the Chum Bucket. Squidward goes to the front doors, but a meow sound startles him.]
Squidward: Nyah! Whaa?
SpongeBob: [appears in a cat costume] Sorry. [laughs] Stepped on my tail.
Squidward: What are you wearing?
SpongeBob: I'm a cat burglar! [purrs and meows around Squidward and stops] Okay, I'll change. [rips off his cat costume]
[SpongeBob and Squidward go to the front doors. Squidward attempts to push them open, but it is locked.]
SpongeBob: Hang on. [slips in underneath] Ooh.
Squidward: And just how am I supposed to get in? [SpongeBob grabs him by the legs and pulls him in underneath, accidentally ripping his eyes out] Ooh! [grumbles as he grabs his eyes and puts them back on his face]
[SpongeBob peaks through the sewer lid and sees nothing around. He pops out and slides behind the Chum Bucket's menu. He slithers down from the wall, leaving two dents on his body. He and Squidward hide under a table. Squidward bashes SpongeBob on the nose to straighten his head out. Plankton is seen watching a scary old movie.]
TV Monster: [growls]
TV Actress: Ahh!
Plankton: [slurps on soda and eats some popcorn] Yeah, yeah, now eat her brain! [sighs] I love a good romance. [turns off the TV and yawns]
[Plankton hops off his chair while SpongeBob and Squidward hide under the table. Plankton scratches himself and goes into the bathroom. SpongeBob and Squidward follow him. Plankton flosses his teeth with his antenna. His machine brushes his teeth and pours mouth wash in Plankton's mouth. Plankton gargles the mouth wash and swooshes it up in his mouth. His machine places a hair curler on his antennas. He spits the mouth wash in a cup the machine is holding for him. Plankton dips his eyeball in the mouth wash, causing it to burn. The machine sprays eye drops in his eyeball to make it feel better. SpongeBob and Squidward made it to the bathroom where they almost got caught as Plankton exits through the small door. Plankton goes to the elevator and goes up.]
SpongeBob and Squidward: Phew.
Plankton: [exits the elevator] Good night, honey. [blow kisses to Karen]
[Karen snores as she sleeps in her bed. Plankton hops onto his bed, claps his hands to turn off the lights and goes to sleep. SpongeBob sneaks into the bedroom through the doorknob. He slithers past Karen and goes to check on Plankton.]
Squidward: [whispering] What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Making sure he's asleep.
[SpongeBob opens Plankton's eyelid and sees his eyeball snoring. SpongeBob gives Squidward a thumbs up, letting him know that Plankton is sound asleep. Squidward groans. The screen cuts to SpongeBob and Squidward tiptoeing all over the laboratory as they search for the formula. SpongeBob's pants and torso walk off, leaving SpongeBob's head and arms in tact in midair. SpongeBob hears a growling noise.]
SpongeBob: Yeesh! [runs over to Squidward as he torso and upper body reattach themselves] Squidward!
[SpongeBob and Squidward scream as a monstrous shadow roars at them. They run around in panic until something pounces onto Squidward. It was Plankton's pet amoeba, Spot.]
SpongeBob: Aww, it's Plankton's little pet, Spot. He wants to play!
Squidward: [Spot is licking him all over] Will you get him off of me?! [tries to shake Spot off his legs]
SpongeBob: Hmm. Ahh! [grabs a fuel rod, which zaps his body as his skeleton is shown, and whistles] Get the stick, boy! [Spot sees the fuel rod and barks happily] Fetch! [throws the fuel rod and Spot goes after it through the front doors; SpongeBob then morphs into a hand and locks the doors shut]
Squidward: Look out!
[A sleepy Karen rolls in behind SpongeBob.]
Karen: Diodes... zebras... Make a new batch of chum... [snores]
SpongeBob: It's okay. She's in sleep mode.
Karen: Oh, dear, the chum is escaping. [grabs SpongeBob and Squidward, stuffs them in the chum grinder and grinds them both into chum; she snores as she rolls away]
[SpongeBob and Squidward, now grinded up into a pile of chum, slithers away. Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Squidward hiding in empty toxic waste cans and rolling themselves over to the safe where Plankton is keeping the formula. They pop out of the cans and walk over to the safe.]
Squidward: This must be it.
[SpongeBob pushes the buttons on the doors. The alarm goes off and an electric eye looks down on them.]
Electric eye: Remain still for retina scan.
Squidward: Now what'll we do?
SpongeBob: Good thing I brought this! [pulls out a criminal picture of Plankton] They really captured the cute little dimple on his chin.
Squidward: Looks like they captured the rest of him too!
[The electric eye scans the picture and approved it. The electric eye closes itself up and opens the doors. The safe is at the far end.]
SpongeBob: Oh!
Squidward: I'll take it from here. [pushes SpongeBob aside]
SpongeBob: I'm fine.
[Squidward goes for the safe, but he steps on a tile, setting off a booby trap. A giant boot squishes Squidward flat.]
Squidward: You go first this time.
SpongeBob: Hmm-mmph. [goes for the safe, but steps on a tile setting off another booby trap]
[A hammer slams onto Squidward.]
SpongeBob: You okay? [steps on another tile, setting off a third booby trap]
Squidward: No! [gets incinerated by fire underneath him]
[SpongeBob moves over to a different tile, but sets off another booby trap. A pair of robot arms gives Squidward a wedgie. SpongeBob runs around in panic, stepping on more tiles and setting off more booby traps. A bowling ball crushes Squidward's foot.]
Squidward: Ow. [gets slapped in the face repeatedly by a robotic arm]
SpongeBob: [stands on a tile and doesn't move as it sinks down into the floor] I'm standing still! I'm not even doing anything!
[Squidward gets electrocuted by the electrical bolts. Then he gets crushed by a piano followed by a spiked-ball and a boat that resembles Titanic. Squidward is now reduced to liquid and slithers over to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Heh...sorry. [gathers Squidward up and puts him in a bucket.]
[SpongeBob walks over to the safe and revives Squidward back into his normal form. He turns the lock on the safe.]
SpongeBob: Ahh. [the safe opens to reveal the secret formula; he laughs] I can't believe that actually worked! [touches the bottle and the alarm goes off]
[The tile below SpongeBob and Squidward sends them flying into a rocket. The rocket closes before the 3-2-1 countdown and blasts out from the Chum Bucket with a screaming SpongeBob and Squidward inside. The rocket crash lands in the back of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Squidward roll out from the rocket and are completely singed and injured. It is now dawn and Mr. Krabs drives up to the front doors. He goes to unlock the doors and sees SpongeBob and Squidward.]
Mr. Krabs: Good morning, Krusty crew! Ready to cook up a new batch of Krabby Patties? Er... [sees SpongeBob and Squidward singed and injured] Why are you two smoldering?
SpongeBob: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: [covers SpongeBob's mouth] No, he's delirious! He doesn't know what he's saying.
SpongeBob: [pushes Squidward away] No! Mr. Krabs deserves the truth. We accidentally threw away the Krabby Patty formula and Plankton found it! We tried to steal it back, but we failed! [sobs]
Mr. Krabs: [gets raging and smoke steams out of his eyestalks] You did what?! Plankton stole me formuler?!
Squidward: [he and SpongeBob nod their heads] That's what he said. Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: [calmly] Then I'll just have to steal it back. [walks over to the Chum Bucket] Hmm. Uh-huh. [punches a hole through the wall and grabs the secret formula from inside] Oh. [kisses the bottle] Don't worry. Papa's here.
[The scene changes the next morning with the scallop making its rooster call to Bikini Bottom. Plankton, now awake, goes to the safe.]
Plankton: Oh, yeah! [looks at himself with his pocket mirror] Who's the man? You are! Eh, man.
[Plankton throws the mirror away. He turns the lock on the safe. He opens it and instead of the formula, it reveals Spot with the fuel rod barking happily at him. The hole behind Spot was the same hole Mr. Krabs made when he retrieved the formula. Spot jumps onto Plankton with the fuel rod and licks him while in doing so, zapping his body and showing his skeleton.]
Plankton: No, no, no! [growls furiously] Krabs!
[Bubble transition to daytime back at the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] I'm sure glad the formula is back in the safe where it belongs, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Me, too, boy-o. And to make sure you two don't ever take your eyes off it again, I have a surprise for you.
[Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward being stuffed in the safe.]
Mr. Krabs: You're me new security system. [closes the safe and laughs before he leaves]
SpongeBob: Yay!
Squidward: [frightened] Wait! I'm claustrophobic!

When the day is finally over, he rushes to get to his house, but is stopped by Mrs. Puff, as she needs him to fix her flat tire. After doing that, he continues rushing to his house, only to get stopped by Patrick, who needs him to find his rock at the Impound Yard. Afterwards, Sandy needs him to do a chore, but after he hears two fans of Mermaid Man talking about how no real fan would miss the show, he leaves Sandy and continues rushing to his house.However, SpongeBob is constantly stopped by several people as they need him to do their tasks. SpongeBob finally goes back home, hoping that he can at least watch the recorded version, only to see his VCR going haywire and all the other things he set up getting ruined and bursting into flames, which sets his house on fire. He cries so loudly everyone can hear him, and his friends feel guilty for taking advantage of SpongeBob.To compensate for this, they bring SpongeBob, who is in a depressed state, to see a live performance of the episode on an amphitheater. SpongeBob loves their show and thanks them for showing the love they had for him to make up for missing his show. The episode ends with Old Man Jenkins asking everyone what they are doing at his amphitheater, but this makes everyone run away, despite him just wanting to have a role in the play.",Appointment TV,"[The episode begins at a beautiful morning at SpongeBob's house.]

SpongeBob: Normally I like working, but today is moving [close-up of his face in slow-motion] so slowly.
[SpongeBob peaks in through the kitchen window and sees everything moving in a slow pace. Two customers are chewing their food real slow. Incidental 41 bite his Krabby Patty, but slaps Fred in the face, making him spit out his food. Patrick opens his mouth and eats the food. SpongeBob sulks and slides back in the kitchen.]

SpongeBob: Oh, uh, well, [points to his watch] I gotta get home for ""Mermaid Man,"" but—but sure, I guess I have a little time.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, good. Let me know when you're done. [picks up a mug of coffee and a book entitled, ""Gone with the Fin""]
SpongeBob: Luckily, I brought all my tools. [pulls his tie, opens his head and shows a variety of tools] Jack, wrench, hammer, jackhammer— [activates jackhammer and drills in the ground] Whoa! [comes back out] Jack-wrench, wrench-hammer, hammer-hammer. Okay, I'm ready!
[SpongeBob goes underneath Mrs. Puff's boat, levers it up like a jack, and pulls out a pair of scissors.]
SpongeBob: Gotta get that old tire off. And... [cuts the tire into paper dolls and laughs; goes to put a new tire on] Yes? No. Maybe if I try... [groans]
[SpongeBob struggles to put the tire on the wheel, but it slips off and is sent flying to the surface.]
SpongeBob: Hmm. Ah-ha!
[Mrs. Puff sleeps until she feels her boat moving.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Mrs. Puff. Good to go.
[Mrs. Puff drives her boat to her house. She looks down at her wheel and sees SpongeBob implanted himself onto it.]
Mrs. Puff: Thanks again, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, no problem, Mrs. Puff.
[SpongeBob is beaten up from getting crushed by the rocky roads. He pokes a hole, deflates, and flies everywhere. He then looks at his watch.]
SpongeBob: Hmm. I still have time to get home before my show, if I pick up the pace. [runs straight to his house] Ah, home sweet pineapple!
Patrick: Hey, buddy! You got a minute?
SpongeBob: [pops his face out from his back] Oh, uh, not really, but—
Patrick: I double-parked my rock, and it got towed. [shows his spot where his rock was and a sign says ""No Rock Parking""] Could you help me get it back?
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, sure. Uh, but let's make it quick. ""Mermaid Man"" is on soon.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick at the Impound Yard.]
Impound worker: You'se guys can take a look around on your owns. [opens door]
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter the junkyard and sees that everything looks exactly like Patrick's rock.]
SpongeBob: They all look the same, Patrick. How are we gonna find your rock?
Patrick: Don't worry, buddy. I'll know it when I feel it. Oh, this might be it! Give me a hand!
[SpongeBob lifts the rock up with all his might. Patrick rolls underneath and SpongeBob drops it.]
Patrick: Ow! No, this isn't it. Oh, ooh, this one might be it!
[SpongeBob lifts another rock and Patrick slides underneath it. SpongeBob drops it on Patrick.]
Patrick: Ouch! No, this isn't it either. Ow! No. Ow! No. [shouts] No. [screams] No.
[SpongeBob holds up the last remaining rock up for Patrick. Patrick slides underneath it and SpongeBob drops it on him.]
Patrick: [sighs] This is it. This is my rock!
Impound worker: Congratulations. Now there's a little matter of the fee.
Patrick: Oh, talk to him. [picks SpongeBob up and hops on his rock]
SpongeBob: [hands the impound worker money] Here you go.
[The impound worker takes the money and leaves.]
Patrick: [begins driving away with his rock] Thanks, SpongeBob! See you at home for ""Mermaid Man!"" Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: Wait, wait, Patrick! Could you give me a...ride? [groans and a rock crushes him]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob running past Sandy's treedome.]
Sandy: SpongeBob! Oh, thank goodness you're here. I could really use your help.
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Sandy. Uh, I'm kind of in a rush 'cause ""Mermaid Man"" is on and it's the lost episode—
Sandy: Oh, it won't take more than a minute.
[SpongeBob looks at his watch and groans.]
Sandy: My laser acorn experiment blasted a nut-sized hole in my dome. Could you stick your finger here while I go get my fix-it-up kit?
SpongeBob: I don't really have a lot of time to—
Sandy: [plugs the hole with SpongeBob's finger] Thanks, be right back! [runs into her dome]
[SpongeBob sees two unnamed kids passing by.]
Kid #1: Gosh, I can't wait to see that long lost ""Mermaid Man"" episode tonight.
Kid #2: Oh, for sure. No real fan would miss it. Not for the world.
[SpongeBob panics and struggles to break free. Sandy comes back out with her fix-it-up kit.]
Sandy: All righty, SpongeBob. I'm ready to—What? [sees his hand dangling where the punctured hole is]
[SpongeBob regenerates his arm and runs to his house as fast as he could.]
SpongeBob: That's it! No more distractions! I am gonna— [gets grabbed by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Boy-o, you gotta help me sort me loose change!
SpongeBob: But ""Mermaid Man.""
[Mr. Krabs dumps a bucket full of coins over SpongeBob's head. The coins come out in tiny little coin rolls. Mr. Krabs places the coin rolls in his bucket.]
Mr. Krabs: Thanks, boy-o!
[SpongeBob gets up, looks at his watch and panics. He runs out of Mr. Krabs' house, leaving a trail of coins behind.]
SpongeBob: [panting] Don't wanna miss it! Don't wanna miss it! [gets stopped by Larry who wants to have him put tanning lotion on his back] But ""Mermaid Man."" [then he's asked to help change light bulbs with Plankton at the Chum Bucket] But ""Mermaid Man."" [then he's asked to help plant vegetables in Squidward's garden] But ""Mermaid Man."" [shows him giving a line of senior citizens a foot massage at Shady Shoals] But ""Mermaid Man."" [shows him being a crossing guard in Bikini Bottom to help people cross the street] But ""Mermaid Man."" [shows him helping the Flying Dutchman mop up the deck on his ship] But ""Mermaid Man.""
[The scene changes to nighttime. An exhausted SpongeBob walks up to the front door of his house.]
SpongeBob: [sighs and looks at his watch] Well, I may have missed the live broadcast, but at least I got it all on tape. Here I come, ""Mermaid Man!"" [tries to open the door but it's locked] Oh. [tries to pull it open but to no avail; he checks his pockets] Where'd I put my keys? [peaks through the window] Did I leave them on the table again? [sees his VCR going haywire and it spits out the tape's film] No, my tape! [the ice block explodes and soda flies everywhere] My soda! [a bottle of soda hits the popcorn machine, knocking popcorn everywhere] My popcorn! [sees everything a complete mess] My ""Mermaid Man!"" [the VCR lands in the popcorn and the house bursts into flames and SpongeBob screams]
[Gary gets shot out of the house on a flying soda bottle. SpongeBob goes to catch Gary, but he lands on his face.]
Gary: Meow. [slithers off of SpongeBob]
[SpongeBob, completely shocked at what happened, starts feeling really sad and begins to cry. His crying is so loud that it is heard all across Bikini Bottom, which results in waking up the townsfolk.]
Fred: [faintly] My leg!
[Moments later, Squidward, Patrick, Sandy, Larry, Mr. Krabs, Plankton and Mrs. Puff arrive to see what was the matter.]
Sandy: Hey there, SpongeBob. Why all the waterworks?
SpongeBob: [sniffles and wipes his tears with his nose like a windshield wiper] I was so busy helping everyone that I missed ""Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy"" and my VCR didn't record it and now I'll never see it and my life has no meaning!
[SpongeBob sulks away from his friends and goes back into his burning house crying hysterically, now that his chances of seeing the long-lost episode of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy has been shattered. All of SpongeBob's friends, including Squidward, look on at him with sad faces and realize what they have done: they took his kindness for granted and inexplicably ruined his chances of seeing the episode he's been looking forward to watching.]
Sandy: All right, listen up. SpongeBob has helped every single one of us dozens of times over. But we ain't been very helpful to him today.
[All of his friends murmur in agreement.]
Patrick: Yeah, I was a lousy friend.
Sandy: Now, we may have taken advantage of his kindness, but I got a plan to make things right.
[They hover together and Sandy quietly explains her plan in hopes of making up to SpongeBob for letting him miss the show.]
French Narrator: The Next Day...
[The scene changes to the next morning. SpongeBob's living room is a complete mess and is covered with burnt popcorn and soda bottles. SpongeBob, having bags in his eyes and a 5 o'clock shadow, goes into a state of deep depression and holds out a burnt videotape. He drops the tape and moves his finger around.]
SpongeBob: Play... [drinks a bottle of burnt soda and eats some burnt popcorn]
Sandy: [knocks on the door and peaks through the window] Hey there, SpongeBob. Feeling any better?
[SpongeBob mutters in depression.]
Sandy: Aww, [jumps in through the window] why don't you come with me? I have a little surprise for you.
SpongeBob: I'm not really in the mood, Sandy.
Sandy: Aww, quit acting like a calf with colic. [pushes SpongeBob out with his chair] Come on, SpongeBob. [pushes him to a television-themed outdoor amphitheater]
SpongeBob: Gee, Sandy, where'd you get an outdoor amphitheater?
Sandy: Don't worry about that. Just sit right here and enjoy the play.
SpongeBob: Oh, okay.
[Plankton comes out from the curtains and knocks the microphone over so he can speak into it.]
Plankton: Welcome, ladies and morons! It's time for the exciting conclusion to... [the curtains open] ""The Case of the Curious Cliffhanger!"" [laughs]
SpongeBob: [wakes up from his depression] Huh? Whoa! [laughs and pulls his chair forward to watch it closer]
[On the stage, Squidward is dressed as Doctor Negative, Mrs. Puff is the Atomic Flounder, Gary is the Dirty Bubble, Larry is Mermaid Man, and Patrick is Barnacle Boy.]
Larry: Help me, Barnacle Boy. I'm hanging...from this cliff.
[A cardboard cloud falls down.]
Patrick: And look, I am also hanging from this cliff. We sure are in danger.
[SpongeBob covers his eyes, but pop them out through his head to see. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs as Captain Tightwad fighting against Larry as Mermaid Man.]
Mr. Krabs: [grunts] You should give up while you can, Mermaid Man.
[Squidward struggles to hold Mr. Krabs up, but ends up swinging him up and down.]
Larry: Haven't you heard, Captain Tightwad? I'll never give up fighting...um...Line?
Mrs. Puff: [struggling to hold Larry up] Oh, um... [looks through the script book and whispers] Evil.
Larry: Evil!
[Three cannons steam smoke out at Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs falls to the floor and Squidward falls on top of him. The curtain closes over Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Wow! Yes, yes!
[The scene changes to the play's grand finale. During the finale, Sandy is dressed as Miss Appear and Plankton is wearing a Man Ray helmet. The rest of the cast remain as Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, the Atomic Flounder, the Dirty Bubble, Doctor Negative, and Captain Tightwad.]
Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Plankton, and Mrs. Puff: ♪He may be half a mermaid!♪
Gary: ♪Meow!♪
Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Plankton, and Mrs. Puff: ♪And he may be half a man!♪
Gary: ♪Meow!♪
Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Plankton, and Mrs. Puff: ♪But to us he's more than a hero!♪
Gary: ♪Meow, meow!♪
Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Plankton, and Mrs. Puff: ♪He's our Mermaid Man!♪
[Plankton pushes the button on the remote and ignites fireworks for the finale as Larry makes Mermaid Man's hero pose.]
SpongeBob: [sheds a tear and whistles] Ah, oh, bravo! Bravo! Bravo! [laughs as he bounces around in happiness] Yes! Ah! [flies onto the stage like a rocket] Thank you, everyone! [hugs all of his friends] I loved the show! And I loved the love you showed me! And I love how you showed me the love you showed me in the show I love. [his eyes widen] This is my favorite episode of ""Mermaid Man"" ever!
[SpongeBob and all of his friends cheer in happiness. Just then, Old Man Jenkins arrives on the stage.]
Old Man Jenkins: Hey! What are you kids doing in my outdoor amphitheater?
Sandy: [screams] Cheese it, everyone! It's Old Man Jenkins! [screams]
[Everyone, except SpongeBob, run off the stage.]
Old Man Jenkins: Come back! I just wanna be in the play.
SpongeBob: Aww, I'll play with you, Old Man Jenkins. [hands Old Man Jenkins a purple starfish] Do you wanna be Mermaid Man?
Old Man Jenkins: It's the role of my dreams! [places the starfish on his face and flies in the sky] Zoom! [laughs] Whoo!

This is the final straw for Bubble Bass, as he decides to move to his grandmother's house. However, he needs two idiots to do the job for him. Fortunately, SpongeBob and Patrick arrive at just the right time. Bubble Bass tells them if they help him move him out, he will give them free Krabby Patties, which convinces them to help out.Bubble Bass makes the two help move out his furniture and fakes him breaking his back so he does not have to do any work. SpongeBob and Patrick end up packaging everything except for the frame of the house and carry the bag through Bikini Bottom.SpongeBob and Patrick meet some obstacles while bringing the bags, but eventually reach Bubble Bass' grandma's house. They accidentally destroy her house due to the weight of the bag, but it turns out they were at a house similar to the house they were supposed to go to. They finally reach Bubble Bass after walking across a bridge between the two houses. However, despite Bubble Bass' promise, he eats the bags with the Krabby Patties. Angered, Patrick tells him that things will get crazy if he does not give SpongeBob a free lunch. The two leave, but Bubble Bass does not care as he still moved out. However, it turns out SpongeBob and Patrick had packaged his mother in the bag too, making her furious and punish Bubble Bass, as the episode ends.",Moving Bubble Bass,"[The episode begins with the start of the late-night talk show ""Snark Chat with Bubble Bass"". The title text appears over a starry background.]
Narrator: Snark Chat with Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: And we're back. My first guest had dinner with me just last night. He's a close personal friend of mine. Please welcome the Krabby Patty. [audience clap] Great to have you back on the program.
Krabby Patty: Great to be here, BB.
Bubble Bass: Well, I'm sorry to say it, but last night, you were not quite as delicious as one would hope.
Krabby Patty: Oh, don't worry, I'm sure Mr. Krabs will give you a refund.
[A percussion rimshot sting is heard, followed by Bubble Bass and the Krabby Patty laughing. However, Mama Bass interrupts the show.]
Mama Bass: Bubble Bass, who are you talking to down there?
Bubble Bass: Mother! Please stop trying to undermine my fantasy talk show! [Krabby Patty thuds as a cardboard] Mmph.
Mama Bass: You march yourself upstairs this instant! Take out the garbage, dry the dishes, and walk the worm!
Bubble Bass: Ooh, I don't feel like it!  Huh? [Mama Bass throws garbage, two dishes, and the worm at him, who swallows the second dish.] That tears it, Mother! [grunts] I am moving out! [slams the front door]
Mama Bass: Moving? Hah! You can't even do your own laundry! [grunts and throws an underwear at Bubble Bass]
Bubble Bass: [underwear lands on Bubble Bass's face, and a fly is heard buzzing. SpongeBob and Patrick, on a wagon, are laughing in the background] All I need to do is find two able-bodied idiots. But where am I to find such stupidity on such short notice? Hm... [SpongeBob and Patrick ride the wagon using their paddles but collide into Bubble Bass.]
SpongeBob: Whoops. [Bubble Bass grunts] Sorry, Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: Why you two able-bodied idiots! I— [gasps and giving an evil grin] Ooh. [Patrick sobbers and SpongeBob blinks strangely] Why, SpongeBob and Patrick, my occasional friends. How would you two like to earn [holds two lunch bags] a free lunch?
Patrick: Freeeeeee lunch!
[Patrick's head turns as if a balloon and then explodes, as the scene changes to inside Bubble Bass's home.]'
Bubble Bass: All righty, we're moving all of my belongings out of my mother's basement into my grandmother's basement across town. Let's start with my lounge.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, up with the loveseat. [grunts]
Bubble Bass: [fakes having his back popped by breaking a stick] Ow! My bad back! I guess you two will have to move everything without me. So I'll meet you both at this address.
SpongeBob: But don't you have to pack your things before we can move 'em?
Bubble Bass: Ooh, ahh, I guess you'll have to pack my stuff too. But remember with gastric prizes await your mouths.
[Patrick drools, releasing a ship blaring a beat horn.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. [puts a finger inside Patrick's mouth, causing him to fill up and release water]
[Bubble Bass laughs evilly while climbing upstairs with the lunch bags.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, let's get p-p-p-packing!
[Bubble transition to the two cleaning up. Patrick grumbles trying to fit a stool into the box. He frustratingly uses a mallet to break the stool. He hums while using a broom and dustpan to clean up the stool rubble before placing in the box.]
SpongeBob: Oh... [grunts while putting a handful of action figure toys in the box. He puts on welder's helmet and turns on the torch. He melts the toys while humming. He takes off the helmet, revealing a weird face, then laughs.]
Patrick: Huh... [struggling to hold a pile of comic books] Hmm, mm. [eats the comic books and spits them out as rubble in the box. He coughs out a comic book paper piece labeled ""Comic"", then closes the box.]
[SpongeBob pushes three computers in the box while grunting. Patrick grunts while lifting the toilet, causing the water to gush out. He drops the toilet in the box SpongeBob is holding, but the toilet shatters and Patrick groans. Patrick then unravels the remaining toilet paper while leaning on the water gusher where the toilet used to be. SpongeBob and Patrick next use a cart to push wooden planks while going upstairs, grunting.]
[Bubble transition to Patrick hitting the mailbox with an axe, causing clanging. SpongeBob pops out of the mailbox and gives a thumbs-up, but the mailbox collapses. SpongeBob spits out the mail with his tongue and Patrick exclaims. Later, the garbage bag is overloaded with Bubble Bass's stuff as trash. SpongeBob plants the mailbox atop the garbage bag.]
Patrick: All right, that's the last of it.
SpongeBob: [jumps off a trash bag] Whew, I hope we didn't leave anything behind.
Patrick: [grunts] [part of the house clangs]

SpongeBob: Oh pardon us, ma'am, but could you walk around?
Lady Upturn: Walk around? Hmph, I'm Lady Upturn the 333rd, and you want me to walk around? [laughs] I'm afraid you just have to back it up.
SpongeBob: Back it up? [backup alarm blares] Okay. Back it up, Patrick.

SpongeBob: Hmm... Hm? [turns paper around] Hey, this is the address! We made it, Patrick! Nice aim, babies!
Patrick: Hooray! Now, where's that free lunch? [slurps] [thinks again about it]
SpongeBob: [groans] [slaps Patrick] Focus! Let's get all this stuff inside the house, then we can eat. Hmm, hmm.
Patrick: Hmm, hmm.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both hum]
SpongeBob: Oh, Bubble Bass, special delivery. [shocked] Hmm? Okay, Patrick, push it!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both grunt] [bag thuds]
Patrick: [goes through the back door to pull it] [becomes muscular] [destroys the house] And that's how you do it.
SpongeBob: [frightened] Uh-oh, Patrick. Look what we did to Bubble Bass's granny's house.
Fruit man: This isn't Bubble Bass's grandmother's house. That is! [points to Bubble Bass's grandmother's house] This was my house!
SpongeBob: Well, that's a relief. For a minute there, I thought we did something wrong.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whew.
Fruit man: [blows up and hat flies down]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both grunt]
SpongeBob: [looks down] Don't look down, Patrick!
Patrick: [zips eyes] I turned off my eyes. [wind gusting]
SpongeBob: [whimpers] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh! [hiccups] Uh-oh, Patrick, I think I have the— [hiccups again] Hiccups.
Patrick: Hiccups? I want some. I'm so hungry!
SpongeBob: [hiccups again, exclaims] Here comes another one, Patrick.
Patrick: [blocks SpongeBob's hiccup, grunting]
SpongeBob: Thanks, buddy. We're almost there. Just a few more steps, and we'll claim that free lunch.
Patrick: Yeah— [hiccups saying ""Hiccup!""]

Lady Upturn: Back it up! Back it up!
Babies: [laugh]
Lady Upturn: [hits Patrick in the head with a shoe]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both scream as the rope pull them up, and lands in Bubble Bass's house] Oof, ta-da, Oof.
Bubble Bass: I hope you didn't damage my goods.
SpongeBob: Oh, your goods are all good, Bubble Bass. And we sure build up an appetite for that free lunch.
Patrick: [gulps out a bib and fork and knife]
Bubble Bass: Oh, yes, about that. I'm afraid I was waiting for you so long that I ate them! [eats the paper bags] Mmm. [belches]
SpongeBob: [whimpers]
Patrick: [inhales and swallows the fork, knife, and bib. grumbles] If my friend SpongeBob doesn't get his free lunch, [a realistic close-up of Patrick's face] things are gonna get crazy! [pants while Bubble Bass melts]
SpongeBob: That was the meanest thing I ever saw, Bubble Bass. You, sir, have crossed the line of aquatic decency. You might think you took a couple of bottom feeders like us for a ride today, but I got a newsflash for you, slappy. These bottom-feeders wouldn't eat your free lunch if you paid us.
Patrick: I would.
SpongeBob: Come, Patrick. I'll make you a free Krabby Patty for $2.50 plus tax.
Bubble Bass: [watches the pair leave and laughs] Well, you pulled it off, Bubble Bass. And you didn't even have to flick a fin. [hums and opens a box]
Mama Bass: [emerges from a box and growls] Bubble Bass, why do you think it's funny to pack your mother in a box and drag her all over town?!
Bubble Bass: [shocked] Mother?! [grunts as she picks him up and stuffs him in two boxes]
Mama Bass: [Pulls a dolly out her hair] We'll just see how you like it! [pants as she pushes him]
Bubble Bass: I didn't do it! [Mama Bass bumps into a mailbox] Ow! [bumps him into a building] Mother, please— [grunts] It was SpongeBob and Patrick! [grunts] I'll dry the dishes, Mommy. [grunts] I love you, Mommy.",1.35,Doug Lawrence

Perch Perkins is reporting on the news that SpongeBob is attempting to dive to the surface of the ocean, and he will be the first sea sponge ever to do so. Inside SpongeBob's house, Gary is rubbing lard on SpongeBob's back, as SpongeBob fantasizes about the upcoming event. In the fantasy, a little kid walks up to a SpongeBob statue, who talks to him. The little kid screams and runs away as the fantasy sequence ends, and SpongeBob claims that he has to warm up. SpongeBob attempts to lift some weights, but ends up accidentally throwing the weights out of his house, and exclaims that he is ready. Back outside, Mr. Krabs is seen selling SpongeBob standees. Patrick walks up to one of the standees (thinking that it is the real SpongeBob), and tries to make conversation with it. Patrick thinks SpongeBob is giving him the silent treatment, prompting him to do the same. Bubble Bass, thinking Patrick is a standee, walks up to Mr. Krabs and asks him how much he is worth. Bubble Bass ends up paying 10 dollars for the ""standee."" SpongeBob then walks out of his house and attempts to do the high sea dive off of an upside down diving board, only to fail, disappointing the crowd of people as they walk away.SpongeBob questions why he was not able to go up, to which Sandy walks up to him and tells him that Olympic divers in Texas use gravity to help them go down, and that he should use anti-gravity to go up. As Sandy walks away, SpongeBob gets an idea and runs inside of his house. He then returns to the upside down diving board, now with balloons tied to his waist, and dives to the surface of the ocean, while Squidward is seen in the background grumbling to himself and picking up trash. As SpongeBob is about to reach the surface of the ocean, he is blocked by a giant island of trash from the surface world, which also causes his balloons to pop. SpongeBob is upset about this at first, but decides to explore the trash island. He plays with a giant telephone and a giant comb, and accidentally runs into a giant building. This causes the objects, as well as a couple of others, to float down to the bottom of the ocean. Just then, a group of fish look on as a farmer uses the giant comb to grow his crops, making the fish assume that these are gifts from Neptune. Nearby, a group of campers use a giant pen to hold up their tent, and a recently married couple use the giant building as a house.Meanwhile, SpongeBob continues to explore the trash island, but out of nowhere, he is hit in the face by a giant fork. The thrower is none other than Old Man Jenkins, who has gone crazy and thinks he is King Neptune. SpongeBob plays along, claiming to be Poseidon. SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins then start throwing random giant objects at each other, causing them to float down to the bottom of the ocean. Back in Bikini Bottom, one fish uses a giant knife as a surfboard, and a couple of other fish use a giant vacuum cleaner as a car. A little girl is seen attracting a crowd of people, and excitedly tells them that if they want to receive something from Neptune, they will have to send him messages using balloons, and the crowd does exactly that. Up on the trash island, Old Man Jenkins examines SpongeBob, and discovers that he is not actually Poseidon, to which SpongeBob points out that Old Man Jenkins is not Neptune either. Old Man Jenkins explains his backstory on how he ended up on the trash island. One year ago, we see Old Man Jenkins celebrating his birthday party. A fat woman gives Old Man Jenkins about a dozen balloons, causing him to float upward. The old people seem to be apathetic to the situation, and walk back inside. As the flashback ends, a bunch of balloons are seen landing on the island, with different people saying what they want from King Neptune.Old Man Jenkins wants to go back down to Bikini Bottom to help his ""subjects,"" and SpongeBob gets the idea to build a ladder out of the trash to climb back down. Meanwhile, the Bikini Bottomites are freaking out because no more trash is coming down from the surface. As they are about to sacrifice a woman fish, the ladder that SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins built reaches the ground. Everyone thinks that if they climb the ladder, it will lead them to more free stuff. On the surface, SpongeBob finishes building the ladder, as he notices that they are right at the surface. He proudly plants a flag on top of the ocean, and the both of them start climbing down the ladder. They notice that the ladder is shaking, and the Bikini Bottomites see Old Man Jenkins, thinking that he is Neptune. This makes everyone shake the ladder even harder, but SpongeBob explains that he dove up to the surface of the ocean and found Old Man Jenkins living among the objects. The people exclaim that SpongeBob is the one that sent down the objects and call him a hero. The ladder ends up shaking so much that it completely collapses and spreads trash throughout Bikini Bottom. Old Man Jenkins surfaces out of the trash, still claiming to be King Neptune. Suddenly, the real King Neptune shows up, and smites Old Man Jenkins with his trident as punishment for impersonating him! Mr. Krabs approaches the massive trash pile and pulls a flattened SpongeBob out of it. He thinks SpongeBob is another one of his standees and throws him in the back of his truck and drives off. SpongeBob reflects on how the citizens of Bikini Bottom called him a hero, as the episode ends.",High Sea Diving,"[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house where a large crowd of people is gathered to watch SpongeBob perform his latest stunt: To become the first sponge to high dive up to the surface.]
Perch Perkins: Perch Perkins here for Bikini Bottom News. Today, SpongeBob SquarePants will attempt the impossible: a high-sea dive from that diving board! [points to the diving board on the side of SpongeBob's house] He'll be the first sponge ever to dive up through the ocean.
[Inside the house, Gary is spreading lard all over SpongeBob's body.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Did you hear what Perch said, Gary? The first sponge!
[SpongeBob imagines a statue of himself being built in his honor. Monroe Timmy walks up and stares in awe at the statue.]
Monroe Timmy: Whoa.
SpongeBob Statue: [comes to life] Pretty cool, huh, kid? [winks]
[Monroe Timmy screams and runs away. The daydream ends. SpongeBob sucks the little buoy in his lard-covered body.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary, that's enough lard. I gotta warm up.
[SpongeBob slides over to the barbells. He goes to lift it up, but his arms keep slipping off. He ties his arms on the barbell and proceeds to lift it up. The weight of the barbell causes SpongeBob to fall over and it falls off his arms. The barbell is sent flying and crashing through the wall.]
SpongeBob: That's good. I'm all warmed up.
[Mr. Krabs is outside selling SpongeBob-themed products.]
Mr. Krabs: Get your SpongeBob standees here! Buy one and take home a hero! [holds a standee up for Nat Peterson] Here you are, [hits Nat with the standee] here! [hits him again] Here!
Patrick: [walks up and sees a standee of SpongeBob, which he stupidly mistakes for SpongeBob] Hey, SpongeBob. What's new? [silence; Patrick gets mad] Oh, so that's how it is, huh? The silent treatment. Well, two can play at that game, mister! [huffs and pouts]
Bubble Bass: [walks up] Excuse me. How much for this stupid starfish standee?
Mr. Krabs: [appears and sees Patrick] Hmm? Hmm. [giggles and makes a greedy face, seeing a perfect chance at more profit] 20 bucks?
Bubble Bass: [grunts as he pulls Patrick's left arm off] But it's damaged.
Mr. Krabs: 10 bucks? [giggles]
Bubble Bass: [holds up money] Sold!
[Bubble Bass gives Mr. Krabs the money. Mr. Krabs' eyelids eats the money and he burps out a receipt from his mouth. The crowd continues to chatter as they wait for SpongeBob to perform his stunt.]
SpongeBob: [pops out from the window] Hi-uh! [sticks himself on the diving board, but he's upside down; he pulls out his little buoy from his head]
Perch Perkins: And here's our hero now with the flag he will plant on the surface.
[The crowd cheers.]
SpongeBob: Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! [goes to the end of the diving board as drumroll is being played; he attempts to perform his stunt, but since he was upside-down, he falls to the ground] Ahh! Ooh.
[The crowd groans and leaves in disappointment.]
Mr. Krabs: Get your SpongeBob standees right here. Buy one and take home a loser. [chortles]
SpongeBob: [gets up] I just don't understand it. Surface divers go down. Why didn't I go up?
Sandy: Well, back in Texas, Olympic divers have gravity to help them go down. What you need is anti-gravity to go up.
SpongeBob: Anti-gravity? Yes! [pops lightbulbs out from his body] Yah! [sucks the lightbulbs in his body and giggles]
[SpongeBob runs back in his house. Then he comes back out on the diving board with balloons tied around his waist.]
Squidward: [picks up trash around his house] Hmph. Stupid messy moron rubbernecking flounders and so on...
[SpongeBob goes to perform his stunt and successfully dives off the diving board. The balloons help him float in the air while Squidward continues grumbling as he picks up the trash.]
SpongeBob: I'm doing it! I'm doing it!
[SpongeBob floats into a swarm of jellyfish. Jellyfish fly around him as he continues floating to the surface. They make a stairway for him and SpongeBob climbs higher and higher.]
SpongeBob: I'm the first high-sea-diving sponge. [pulls out the little buoy from his nose]
[But just when he was about to reach the surface, a pile of garbage blocks everything. The balloons pop and SpongeBob holds onto a rope.]
SpongeBob: Hey, what happened to the surface?
[The screen zooms up to Bikini Atoll where the garbage reveals itself as the Great Pacific garbage patch, floating on the surface and eventually causing water pollution.]
SpongeBob: Hmm. Huh? [attaches himself to the garbage with the suction cups] Aw, gee, and I was so close. [kicks a bolt and it falls upward] Hmm? What is this place? [puts his little buoy in his head]
[SpongeBob searches around the trash. He climbs on an old television and slides down.]
SpongeBob: Oh!
[SpongeBob climbs on an old telephone receiver and it falls upward. He puts on a bowtie.]
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
[SpongeBob strums on the giant comb like a harp. He giggles and the comb falls upward. SpongeBob climbs on another pile of trash.]
SpongeBob: This place is trash-tastic! [pounds on his chest and does a Tarzan-like yell; suddenly, someone throws a large key in SpongeBob's face.] Ow! [dodges an incoming pen] Oh, hey now! Whoa-whoa-whoa-oh-oh! [bumps into a giant car pump and it falls upward]
[Meanwhile, down on the ground, several townspeople began seeing stuff descending down from the Great Pacific garbage patch from above.]
Dave: What's that?
[The giant comb floats down.]
Evelyn: I don't know.
[The comb lands in front of a farmer.]
Farmer: Hmm. [grunts as he picks up the comb]
[The farmer places the comb on the back of the tractor. He climbs in the tractor and drives it. The comb is being used as a chisel plow and plants begin to sprout.]
Thaddeus: It's a gift!
Evelyn: From the sky?
Dave: From Neptune!
[A group of boy scout campers are setting up a tent.]
Boy Scout Campers: Yay! [the tent falls apart] Aww.
[A pen floats down to them.]
Boy Scout Campers: [gasps and fixes the tent with a pen] Thank you, Neptune!
[A recently married couple enter through a gate and are about to live in their dream home. But unfortunately, there was no home for them to live in.]
Groom: [sheepishly] I'm sorry, honey. I couldn't afford the whole house. Just the door!
[Just then, the giant car pump falls in place where the door is and makes a new house.]
Groom: [happy] Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Look at that!
Bride: Now there's room for my mother!
Groom: Whaa?!
[The bride waves as, the screen pans out and reveals really her tall mother with her packages.]
Bride's Mother: Ehh...
[Meanwhile, back up in the Great Pacific garbage patch, SpongeBob is still wandering around.]
SpongeBob: Hmm? I thought I saw something over— [gets hit by a giant plastic spoon] Ow! [sees a shadowy figure] Hello? Who are you?
[The mysterious figure comes out and reveals himself to be none other than Old Man Jenkins.]
Old Man Jenkins: I'm King Neptune! Feel my power! [throws a paperclip at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ow! Old Man Jenkins? [pulls the paperclip off his face]
Old Man Jenkins: I'm not Old Man Jenkins anymore! I'm King Neptune! Take that! [throws a bottle cap at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [whimpers as he dodges the bottle cap] Huh? All right, I'll play along. Hey, King Neptune! I'm Poseidon! [laughs and throws a giant sandal at Old Man Jenkins]
Old Man Jenkins: [dodges sandal] Oh!
[Old Man Jenkins grabs a giant eraser and throws it at SpongeBob. The two of them get into a trash fight and the thrown trash are being floated down to Bikini Bottom from above. A butter knife floats down to a local business man.]
Business Man: Hmm? Neptune is blessing us with gifts and treasures! [changes into his bathing suit] Surf's up, dude!
[Gale and Nat are driving in a boat. Suddenly, a giant vacuum cleaner crashes down onto their boat. They both giggle and hop onto the vacuum. They drive the vacuum all over Bikini Bottom.]
Nat Peterson: Oh, yeah! All right! Ho-ho!
[A group of people gather around and a little girl is holding a bunch of balloons.]
Little Girl #1: You say your desire into the balloon, blow it up, and send it to Neptune. [whispers] A slice of pizza. [blows a balloon and lets it float to the surface]
Cara: [stretches balloon and speaks into it] A never-ending roll of toilet paper. [blows a balloon and lets it float to the surface]
Little Girl #2: [stretches balloon and speaks into it] A million grandmas. [blows a balloon and lets it float to the surface]
[Sooner or later, many balloons are floating upward to the surface. Meanwhile, back up in the Great Pacific garbage patch, SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins grow tired from their garbage fight. Old Man Jenkins walks up to SpongeBob and looks at him closely.]
Old Man Jenkins: You're not Poseidon. You're SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob: [holds up a mirror] And you're Old Man Jenkins!
Old Man Jenkins: I was Old Man Jenkins 'til I came here. It was a year ago today...
[A flashback is shown with Old Man Jenkins celebrating his birthday with some elderly friends at Shady Shoals Rest Home.]
Senior Citizens: ♪Happy birthday to you♪
[One of Old Man Jenkins' friends gives him a bunch of balloons.]
Old Man Jenkins: Oh, thank you, dea— [begins to float away with the balloons] Hello? Some help, please?
Senior Citizens: [grumble and head back into the rest home] So now I gotta go back? I came all the way over here.
Old Man Jenkins: Hey—hey, come back here! Come back, now!
[The flashback ends. Just then, a yellow balloon appears and pops next to SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins, surprising them.]
Voice #1: Neptune, I want a mustache.
[Another balloon appears and pops.]
Voice #2: Neptune, I want a cool voice.
[Another balloon appears. SpongeBob catches the balloon and pops.]
Patrick: [voiceover] Neptune, I want another balloon.
[Another balloon appears and pops.]
Patrick: [voiceover] Now!
Old Man Jenkins: My subjects! I must get down to help them.
SpongeBob: Well, we could build a ladder out of this stuff and climb down—ooh, uh, down?
Old Man Jenkins: What are you, senile?
SpongeBob: Uh-uh. I'm juvenile! [laughs]
[SpongeBob begins to grab several trash and stacks them up one by one in order to make a ladder to climb back down. Meanwhile, back down on the ground, the townsfolk are starting to get worried.]
Citizen #1: Hey, what happened?
Citizen #2: What's going on here?
Harold: Why isn't Neptune sending us more gifts down for us?
Gale Rechid: We must have upset him.
Harold: You must have upset him! [the townsfolk strap Gale to a death table and is prepared to be killed] This is for you, Neptune! Oohh— [prepares to kill her until...]
Gale Rechid: Wait! Look!
[SpongeBob's ladder made out of the garbage descends downward. The crowd gasps and murmurs in amazement.]
Citizen #3: Oh, it's the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
Citizen #4: What is it?
Gale Rechid: What do you think it is?
Harold: It's a ladder from Neptune! Let's climb up and get more free stuff!
Gale Rechid: Me first! [buffs up her muscles and breaks free]
[Gale runs up to the trash ladder and begins to climb it. Then several other townsfolk join in and follow her up the trash ladder. SpongeBob grabs an old soup can and finishes the ladder. The surface is now sparkly clean from the garbage patch.]
SpongeBob: Phew! It took every piece of the island to make this ladder. Ooh? Hey! Look at that! [pulls the little buoy out of his head and sticks it to the surface] I'm the first sponge to ever do that!
Old Man Jenkins: Big whoop.
SpongeBob: Oh, yes! It's the biggest whoop! Let's go home!
[SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins begin to climb down to the ocean floor. Suddenly, the ladder starts shaking.]
Old Man Jenkins: Stop shaking the ladder!
SpongeBob: I'm not shaking it!
[Down below the ladder, the townsfolk continue to climb up until they see SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins above.]
Gale Rechid: I think I see him! It's Neptune!
Fred: Oh, Neptune!
Citizens: Neptune! Out of my way!
[The townsfolk climb upward but suddenly stop.]
Gale Rechid: Wait a minute. [sees Old Man Jenkins climbing down] It's Old Man Jenkins!
Nat Peterson: Old Man Jenkins is Neptune?
Dale: All hail Old Man Jenkins!
Old Man Jenkins: Get off my trash, you idiots!
Dale: Praise Neptune! We're all idiots for you!
Citizens: We're all idiots! We're all idiots!
[The townsfolk's cheering causes the ladder to shake, knocking over SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Ooh-whaa! [clings onto another box]
Gale Rechid: Hey, it's SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Everybody climb back down! There's nothing up there! [climbs down to the townsfolk] I dove up and found Old Man Jenkins living among all these objects.
Gale Rechid: Then it was you that sent these treasures down!
Nat Peterson: Hooray for SpongeBob! He's our hero!
[The townsfolk cheer. But their cheering shakes the ladder even more.]
SpongeBob: No! Ahh! Ohh—ow!
[The ladder crumbles and all of the trash as well as SpongeBob, Old Man Jenkins, and the townsfolk are sent crashing down to Bikini Bottom. The city is now a complete mess with trash.]
Old Man Jenkins: [pops out from the trash, grabs a bottle cap and a fork, and stands on Nat Peterson's head] I'm King Neptune! King of the seven seas, the lakes, rivers, puddles... [spits saliva into a spittoon] And spit too! I'm the king of spit!
King Neptune: So you're the king of spit?
[Thunder roars]
Old Man Jenkins: [Nervously] Uh-oh.
[Out from the clouds, the real King Neptune appears on his chariot and he's not very happy.]
King Neptune: ""Uh-oh"" is right.
[Old Man Jenkins stands scared as Nat Peterson, upon seeing the real King Neptune, whimpers in fear. He grabs a suitcase and runs away. King Neptune ignites his trident and zaps Old Man Jenkins, burning him to a crisp.]
Old Man Jenkins: I smell like toast. Am I breakfast? [bites off his hand] Needs jelly.
[Mr. Krabs comes by and notices the pile of trash. He also notices SpongeBob's hands sticking out from underneath.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm? [pulls out a mortally wounded SpongeBob] Ooh, well, look at that. Someone threw away a good SpongeBob standee. [laughs and throws SpongeBob in his truck-load of SpongeBob-standees] Yagh! [closes the trunk] Oof! [climbs in the truck] Ugh.
[Mr. Krabs drives away with his truck, carrying SpongeBob and the standees inside.]

[Another drop of coffee falls on SpongeBob. They look up and see the coffeemaker dangling on the ceiling with its cord.]
Both: Ahh! Coffee killer!
[The coffeemaker falls from the ceiling and SpongeBob and Patrick run out. A shadow looms in from behind them. They turn and see the trash robot.]
SpongeBob: You again?
[A soda machine rolls next to the trash robot.]
Patrick: Oh, good! Soda! I was getting thirsty again.
[The soda machine shoots soda into Patrick's mouth. The soda machine then shoots various sodas at SpongeBob and Patrick. They both dodge the incoming sodas like dodging bullets.]
SpongeBob: This is not refreshing! [gets soda flung in his eyes and the soda sprays out, making him fall backwards]
[Patrick picks up a soda, shakes it, opens it, and throws it like a bomb. The soda explodes and sends the soda machine crashing into a wall. The wall breaks apart and falls outside the building. The trash robot snaps its fingers. SpongeBob gets grabbed by the copier and closes its lid several times. The copier then copies SpongeBob onto various papers.]
Patrick: Man, you do not take a bad picture! [shows a crude picture of SpongeBob made by the copier]
[The copier spits out SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Whoa!
[SpongeBob flies into the paper shredder and gets shredded up. Patrick opens the shredder and pulls SpongeBob out.]
Patrick: Hang in there, buddy! Hang in there! [grabs a bottle of glue and makes an nearly successful attempt to glue SpongeBob together]
[Patrick goes somewhere and SpongeBob fixes himself up. Patrick comes back with a tank.]
Patrick: [comes out from the hatch] Hey!
SpongeBob: Hey, where'd you get the tank, Patrick?
Patrick: It's what this company makes. Tanks.
[SpongeBob looks and sees tank-themed advertisements, tank posters, a tank sculpture, a first place trophy in in tanks, and even a tank mobile, behind his back.]
SpongeBob: How did I not notice that? [grabs the cleaning products] We'll use these as ammunition! [stuffs the tank with the cleaning products]
[The trash robot and his machine army search for SpongeBob and Patrick. They stop and see SpongeBob riding a tank.]
Trash robot: Retreat! Retreat!
[SpongeBob and Patrick fire the tank. They shoot a plunger on the copier. The copier crashes into the wall. The wall breaks apart and falls outside the building. The fourth, third and second floor of the building crash down onto one another. The paper shredder tries to escape, but SpongeBob and Patrick fire the tank at it with the plunger. The paper shredder crashes into another wall. The wall breaks apart and falls outside the building. The upper floors then crash down onto the first floor. The trash robot emerges from the rubble and is completely wrecked up. It bumps into the tank and becomes afraid, thinking that SpongeBob and Patrick are going to hurt it.]
Patrick: [comes out from the hatch] Hello!
[The trash robot surrenders the war and waves a little white flag. The trash robot goes to leave.]
SpongeBob: Hey, trash bot! [throws a chunk of the building to the trash robot and it eats it]
Trash robot: Yummy, trash.
[The last wall breaks apart and falls outside the building. Now, the entire building is completely destroyed. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick finally cleaning the stain off the floor of the main office right before dawn.]
SpongeBob: SpongeBob SquarePants always keeps his word. That carpet is clean.
Patrick: And I helped!
SpongeBob: You sure did, buddy! Come on, pal. Let's go get us a snack.
Patrick: Oh, I like that sound, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob and Patrick leave the building as it now stands in ruin. Meanwhile, the worker, who was not aware of the destruction, gets up from his chair, stretches and prepares to leave. However, he falls downward. The security guard enters the ruins of the building and catches the worker. He sees the place completely destroyed and drops the worker.]
