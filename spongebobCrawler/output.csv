He's eager to get ready for the day that he is to apply for a fry cook job at the Krusty Krab. He warms up by lifting a weight with stuffed animals before jogging to the restaurant with his iconic ""I'm ready!"", while Patrick Star encourages him from his rock.SpongeBob starts talking about what job he will do when he reaches the Krusty Krab, but feels like his reach is not ready. Patrick then appears, encouraging him that he was born to have a job. SpongeBob eventually decides to go to the Krusty Krab to get the job. Squidward sees SpongeBob running to the restaurant, causing him to panic and to tell Mr. Krabs to watch out for SpongeBob.SpongeBob has already arrived, though, and he tries to get Mr. Krabs to give him the job after jumping back and forth across the restaurant after tripping on a loose nail. He tells Mr. Krabs that Squidward will vouch for him, but Squidward tells Mr. Krabs that he does not believe SpongeBob should get the job. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob that if he gets a seemingly nonexistent hydro-dynamic spatula, he will get the job. SpongeBob quickly runs to the Barg'N-Mart to get it, as Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh, thinking he will not have the job.Soon after SpongeBob leaves, five buses filled with a bunch of hungry anchovies arrive at the restaurant, making Squidward and Mr. Krabs panic, as the latter knows what happens when anchovies come. As the anchovies flood the restaurant, Squidward tries to get them all settled, but they're still crazy. It seems the two are both finished due to the flood of anchovies, but then SpongeBob arrives with the hydrodynamic spatula he found (as there was only one in stock), having fulfilled the errand Mr. Krabs gave him and leaving the two in stunned surprise. SpongeBob goes into the kitchen and, in a montage accompanied by Tiny Tim's ""Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight,"" cooks many Krabby Patties then tosses them to all the hungry anchovies until they all feel satisfied and leave the restaurant.Mr. Krabs recruits SpongeBob as a fry cook thanks to him saving the Krusty Krab from the anchovies, much to Squidward's chagrin, then goes to his office to count the day's profits. Then, Patrick walks into the restaurant and order a Krabby Patty, prompting SpongeBob to create a slew of patties and chuck them all at him, flinging the former out. Squidward tells Mr. Krabs to go see SpongeBob and possibly get him in trouble for the mess he made.",Help Wanted,,2.96,"Stephen Hillenburg,Derek Drymon,Tim Hill"

SpongeBob stops for a time, takes a few tentative taps of his hammer, and then quickly finishes construction before Squidward has a chance to complain again.At the newly built stand, SpongeBob offers customers an opportunity to blow a bubble for twenty-five cents. Patrick comes by and asks to try it out. Though he does not have any money, he ""borrows"" a quarter from SpongeBob to pay for it. Unfortunately, Patrick's strained blowing fails to produce a bubble. SpongeBob offers to teach him for an extra quarter, which he happily ""loans"" to Patrick. SpongeBob then demonstrates his somewhat peculiar, yet effective, bubble-blowing technique, which produces a variety of bubble shapes, including a massive elephant-shaped bubble that gets stuck in Squidward's house and pops.The fuming Squidward comes out and approaches the now ostensibly closed bubble stand. He demands to know how they can cause so much disruption just by blowing bubbles. SpongeBob explains that he is creating art and utilizing his technique to its fullest potential. Squidward scoffs at SpongeBob's ideas of art and marketing, sending SpongeBob and Patrick back to their homes in a sad mood. Still snickering, Squidward begins to examine the bubble wand out of growing curiosity. As he tries to blow a bubble himself, SpongeBob quickly comes out and tells Squidward to pay a quarter, shocking him. Squidward reluctantly lays down a quarter for the bubble, suggesting that it is a very simple feat.Squidward attempts to impress the two with his skill, to no avail. All the while, SpongeBob and Patrick try to convince him to use the technique. Fed up and annoyed, Squidward furiously and mockingly copies their technique then screams into the wand in anger, which produces a giant bubble that impresses SpongeBob and Patrick.Squidward, claiming credit for the bubble he blew, heads back inside his house and plays his clarinet once more, with SpongeBob and Patrick chanting his name while dancing. However, the giant bubble descends and encapsulates Squidward's house, unearthing it and floating with it up in the air as SpongeBob and Patrick watch in horror and try to call Squidward's name to get his attention.When at last Squidward looks outside to greet his ""fans,"" he sees himself high above the ground with SpongeBob and Patrick little more than specks. The bubble then pops with explosive force, prompting SpongeBob and Patrick to look at each other nervously and retreat to their houses. Once Squidward's house floats back down to the ground, Squidward lets out a few final feeble notes from his clarinet.",Bubblestand,,2.51,"Ennio Torresan,Erik Wiese,Stephen Hillenburg,Derek Drymon,Tim Hill"

Squidward sends SpongeBob an order for a Krabby Patty, which through a sleight-of-hand trick SpongeBob performs seems to come out through Squidward's nose. After SpongeBob cooks the patty, however, it begins to move across the floor seemingly on its own and makes its way towards the front door. Mr. Krabs stops the patty in its tracks and reveals that the patty was being stolen by none other than Krabs' diminutive nemesis, Plankton. Krabs places his foe on a plate and flings him back to the Chum Bucket across the street while Plankton exclaims that he will return. Mr. Krabs explains to SpongeBob that Plankton is his arch-competitor, and has been trying and failing to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula for an untold amount of years.Later that night, after the Krusty Krab closes, SpongeBob says goodbye to Mr. Krabs and leaves. On his way home, Plankton stops SpongeBob and tries to convince him that he and the fry cook are somehow friends (or should be since they are both invertebrates), and that as such SpongeBob should come to Plankton's birthday, which he claims is the following day. Plankton gives SpongeBob a golden spatula and says that, ""friends give each other gifts."" SpongeBob then guesses that Plankton would like a booster seat. Plankton sounds happy with this proposition, but declines. Plankton tells SpongeBob that, for his birthday, he wants SpongeBob to give him a Krabby Patty. SpongeBob loudly and angrily refuses, citing that Plankton just wants to make friends with him in order to gain access to the Krabby Patty. He also feels sure that Plankton's birthday was not going to even be the following day, and runs back home, refusing to give Plankton a Krabby Patty whether they become friends or not. Plankton, however, refuses to give up and proclaims that SpongeBob will ""hand-deliver it to [him] personally.""Later that night, as SpongeBob is sleeping, Plankton maliciously enters his head through a pore and makes his way to SpongeBob's brain. He attaches a mind control device to the brain and hijacks SpongeBob's mind and body, forcing him to walk out of his house and through Squidward's house, where he insults the cephalopod. At this point, SpongeBob realizes that Plankton has hijacked his body and tries to tell him to let him go, but Plankton refuses, laughs sadistically, and makes SpongeBob exit the house, leaving Squidward feeling nauseous by what he just saw. After Plankton forces SpongeBob to pass through Patrick's house and tosses him aside, he then forces the sponge into and out of the Krusty Krab where he steals a Krabby Patty. He brings it to an analyzer inside the Chum Bucket, which is designed to figure out the ingredients of whatever is dropped into it. As Plankton cruelly gloats over his victory and begins to force SpongeBob to drop the Krabby Patty, SpongeBob sadly laments his failure to protect it, lovingly describing the Krabby Patty's ingredients and succulence. A hungry Plankton leaps out of SpongeBob's head and onto the Krabby Patty, but bounces off of it and falls into the analyzer, thus trapping himself inside his own computer screen. With his mind and body now freed from Plankton's control, SpongeBob happily walks home with the Krabby Patty in hand, ignoring Plankton's angry demands for him to bring it back, his last plea being, ""I'll settle for some fries!"" ending the episode shortly after.",Plankton!,,2.89,"Ennio Torresan, Jr.,Erik Wiese,Doug Lawrence"

Squidward sees that they are having a private conversation with bubbles. They whisper a message into the bubble wand instead of blowing into it, and when the bubble pops, the recipient can hear the message.Annoyed by this, Squidward comes up with a foolproof plan to make SpongeBob his friend in exchange for his betrayal to Patrick. As the first phase, he makes bubbles of his own using a biproduct from his soufflé, and proceeds to insult the two while (sometimes) imitating their voices to ruin their friendship, thinking it will give him peace and quiet. Thinking the bubbles are from each other, SpongeBob and Patrick become angry and get into a fight as Squidward comes outside and eats his soufflé, amused at his neighbors' fight. The two eventually declare that they are no longer friends before storming back to their houses (unaware of Squidward is the one who caused this).Squidward thinks the plan is working very well and goes to the next phase. Patrick gets squashed with his own house; while laughing and eating, Squidward starts to lure Patrick so he could be the bait to bring SpongeBob to him by pretending to get him to help as phase two of his plan. He begins to choke on the fork he was using, resulting him in fainting. Patrick witnesses this and successfully saves Squidward's life by performing CPR on him.Squidward thanks Patrick and he bribes him to help lure SpongeBob to his house by becoming Patrick's ""new friend"" (actually he is using him to lure SpongeBob as part of his plan), inviting him into his house to watch him practice his clarinet composition called ""Solitude in E Minor"" to lure him to sleep, which is hypnotizing him to help him lure SpongeBob as phase three of his plan. Despite Patrick claiming to love music, he immediately falls asleep as soon as Squidward plays a single note, which is the perfect opportunity to lure SpongeBob and make him his new friend. Meanwhile, a lonely SpongeBob tries to cheer himself up by drawing faces on three of his fingers and pretending they are his ""friends,"" but this only results in him bursting into tears.Squidward continues with his plan by attempting to drag the sleeping, heavy Patrick out of his house, and in the process, he throws his back out, which is phase four of his plan to make SpongeBob his friend. He uses his cries for help to lure SpongeBob, who sees this as an opportunity to help him and, despite protests from Squidward, he launches himself into the latter's back and cracks it back into place. Squidward screams but immediately feels better. He repeats his mistake, referring to SpongeBob as his ""friend"" while thanking him, thus making SpongeBob believe that Squidward is his new best friend.They both walk into Squidward's house and prepare to lure Patrick so Squidward could reveal that SpongeBob is now his friend as the fifth and final phase of his plan. Squidward asks SpongeBob to make noise for Patrick by playing a song badly for him on his cello (which he thinks is a bassinet).  Patrick wakes up while overhearing the song and appears in the window, only to interrupt the song, causing SpongeBob to destroy the instrument in a fit of rage. Squidward explodes in fury and kicks him out as a result, and decides to take a relaxing bubble bath, but is horrified to find Patrick, lounging in the tub and warming up a scrub brush and a bar of soap for him. Disgusted, Squidward furiously orders him to leave, but SpongeBob appears through the window and discovers Patrick in Squidward's tub, causing the two to argue again. This drives Squidward crazy with horror, and he flees his house to hide in a trash can outside. Seeing the huge terrible mess he created instead of getting the peace and quiet he thought he'd get, Squidward realizes he needs a plan to reunite SpongeBob and Patrick (and thus make them leave him alone).Squidward decides to invite SpongeBob and Patrick to a dinner party (without telling either of them that the other is coming) to fix their friendship. When they arrive, they are still mad at each other. Squidward tries to get them back together by offering them soda, but the situation devolves into a competition to see who can drink the most soda and thus become Squidward's friend. Eventually, Squidward runs out of soda and leaves to get some more, telling the two to stay and ""chat.""While he is gone, SpongeBob and Patrick, who are both extremely engorged from all the soda they drank, still refuse to talk or even look at each other. SpongeBob then hiccups a small bubble that makes a burping sound upon popping, which amuses them both. Their immense laughter which follows releases bubbles, reverts them to their normal weight, and they become friends again. However, they create so many bubbles that it causes Squidward's house to explode. Upon arriving back and seeing the destruction, Squidward gets enraged and angrily tells the two to leave, and slams the door (which is somehow still standing) shut. Seconds later, a bubble pops against the door, causing it to fall over and crush Squidward, who then weakly moans over regaining pain in his back, concluding the episode.",Naughty Nautical Neighbors,,2.83,"Sherm Cohen,Aaron Springer,Doug Lawrence"

They observe a jellyfish swimming by through a massive telescope protruding from a window in the house, then slide down ropes (causing them to get rope burn that literally produces flames on their hands) and assemble their jellyfish nets while SpongeBob puts on his glasses. Before they leave, they meet Squidward and ask him if he wants to join them. He says that he cannot go with them because he is ""busy"" and goes bicycling instead. SpongeBob asks Squidward if he can join them next time. Squidward sarcastically says yes and goes down the road. SpongeBob does not understand the sarcasm and suspects Squidward never has time for them; Patrick says it's because Squidward doesn't like them, but SpongeBob convinces Patrick that's not the case and plans to go jellyfishing with him eventually.While he is biking, Squidward has an accident involving a jellyfish and gets his tentacles tangled in his bike's pedals, causing him to veer out of control, tumble down a cliff, and explode when he hits the bottom, leaving him wheelchair-bound. SpongeBob and Patrick decide that what Squidward needs is a ""Best Day Ever"" when he returns, bandaged essentially everywhere on his body besides his eyes. The Best Day Ever begins at Squidward's house, where Patrick offers Squidward alphabet soup. Patrick blows the hot soup onto Squidward's bandaged face several times before SpongeBob says that soup is not a good idea. SpongeBob then suggests that some music would be good, and gets Squidward's clarinet. He blows a horrible note before realizing that his lips are too dry, and goes through several exaggerated motions of trying to wet his lips. A disgusted Patrick soon violently snatches the instrument away from SpongeBob, declaring music not to be a good thing for Squidward either.SpongeBob and Patrick then declare that a jellyfishing expedition would be in order for the ""Best Day Ever."" They then go to Jellyfish Fields, SpongeBob tells Patrick to give a net to Squidward while he finds ""a good specimen."" Patrick explains that Squidward must ""firmly grasp [the net] in [his] hand,"" but fails to put a jellyfishing net in Squidward's cast-covered hand and, in frustration, stabs it through Squidward's palm, much to his chagrin and pain.Squidward is not into jellyfishing at first, but when a jellyfish stings him, he wheels after it for revenge. He manages to catch the jellyfish and bangs his net triumphantly against a pink mass. While Squidward does this, the pink mass arises to reveal itself as a queen jellyfish who is irritated by the banging. The queen jellyfish chases after Squidward, while SpongeBob and Patrick obliviously cheer him on until the queen jellyfish zaps Squidward with a massive sting, leaving their cheering replaced with cringing at Squidward's misfortune.The next day, SpongeBob and Patrick covered in band-aids meet outside Squidward's house, where they see he is now life-support-bound and attempt to talk to him but are ignored. After he is unable to enter his home, they apologize and give Squidward the jellyfish that he caught the previous day as an apology. SpongeBob asks Squidward if he still isn't mad at them, but he frees the jellyfish from the jar, causing Patrick and SpongeBob to realize that he is and run off into the distance from the jellyfish while being stung repeatedly. As Squidward laughs at their misfortune, the queen jellyfish finds him and stings him again, destroying his life-support and shattering his body cast.

Larry and Sandy do several impressive weight stunts, while SpongeBob tries to pick up a stick. When SpongeBob strains to pick up a stick with two marshmallows on the sides, he accidentally rips his pants.This causes everyone to laugh, prompting SpongeBob to continue making ripped pants jokes. After a while, though, SpongeBob's jokes start to annoy the people in Goo Lagoon. At some point, SpongeBob fakes himself drowning in order to make a ripped pants joke, but this proves to be too far, as it causes everyone, most importantly Sandy, to get disgusted with SpongeBob and continue playing without him.SpongeBob tries to figure out more ripped pants jokes as the last one did not work but realizes nobody is paying attention to him, and tears off his pants during the course of one of these jokes. The pair of pants suddenly takes on a personality and deserts SpongeBob as well. He sees some other people who make big mistakes.

SpongeBob's chance to take the stage arrives, but his planned job-centered routine, featuring weak jokes about mundane topics such as salt, tomatoes, and forks, does not go over well. As the hecklers (even Patrick) jeer, SpongeBob tries to make a witty observation, anything to get a laugh. He notices Sandy's buck teeth and starts joking about them, which earns chuckles from the audience. SpongeBob begins telling more ""squirrel jokes"" about how smelly and stupid squirrels supposedly are. The entire crowd roars with laughter, all except Sandy. After his act, Sandy confronts SpongeBob backstage and tells him that his jokes are hurtful, but he insists that it is just an act and assures her that ""Everyone knows you're the smartest creature in Bikini Bottom.""The next day, it turns out that everyone has taken the jokes to heart and either avoids or ridicules Sandy. She talks with SpongeBob again on the next night of the Komedy Krab, explaining how the jokes are affecting her public image, and she asks him to use some of his other jokes instead. Fearing his original jokes will not cut the mustard, SpongeBob gives it a shot anyway, but to no avail; the crowd wants squirrel jokes. SpongeBob quietly leaves the stage, seemingly for good. In the next moment, he bursts back on stage with an epiphany, fake buck teeth and a stereotypical Southern accent, resuming the squirrel jokes with aplomb.After the performance, SpongeBob finds a note from Sandy, stating that she has finally realized how funny his jokes are and to come to her treedome to celebrate. When he visits her, however, Sandy looks and acts exactly as his jokes make her out to be; an idiotic, clueless yokel.Sandy has SpongeBob literally glued to his seat so he will not fall off and removes his water helmet to serve as a vase for the flowers. When SpongeBob starts to dehydrate, he begs for water, so Sandy pops a hose in his mouth to fill him up. Only after SpongeBob has expanded to fill every inch of the treedome does he promise to quit telling squirrel jokes.At the following Komedy Krab event, SpongeBob tells a single, toned-down squirrel joke. He then springboards into making fun of everyone else, including sponges, fish, and crabs. The crowd jovially laughs at themselves.

SpongeBob, struggling to blow away the shell, ends up blowing it so hard sand comes out and lands on Squidward. SpongeBob comes to Squidward and blows off the sand that landed on Squidward, as well as his face.

Having taken the oral exam 37 times before, SpongeBob is able to answer most of the questions before Mrs. Puff even asks them. However, upon reaching the driving portion, SpongeBob gets nervous and quickly loses control of the boat, crashing into a lighthouse and causing Mrs. Puff's body to inflate.Later that night, SpongeBob complains about his failure to Gary, who asks him to go for a walk, which he declines. Patrick is then heard talking to him from a walkie-talkie under his covers. He asks SpongeBob to head to his library for a ""surprise,"" and SpongeBob finds Patrick wearing his clothes and calling himself ""Patrick SquarePants."" SpongeBob is too depressed to laugh at this, and explains his problem to Patrick, mentioning that he needs someone to help him ""think straight"" during the driving test. Patrick quickly devises a plan. Using a cowboy hat to hide the antenna, he puts a walkie-talkie inside SpongeBob's head so he can offer advice.The next day, SpongeBob goes back to take the test again. When asked to start the boat, he initially panics, but Patrick's instructions keep him calm. Just after SpongeBob puts the boat in drive, he almost floors the pedal, but Patrick stops him just before his foot touches the pedal. Patrick then tells him to use his big toe on the pedal, and SpongeBob's toe pops out of his shoe to gently press the pedal. This is followed by a montage of SpongeBob acing the exam, interspersed with shots of Patrick eating SpongeBob's food, and reading his diary while helping him.Mrs. Puff is floored by SpongeBob's sudden improvement and jokingly suggests that his success is due to an antenna under his hat through which ""some guy miles away from here"" is giving him all the answers. SpongeBob (and Patrick) finds this hilarious until Mrs. Puff tells SpongeBob it would be cheating to do so. Upon realizing he has been cheating, SpongeBob goes into hysterics, followed by Patrick. Devastated and ashamed about what he has done, Patrick flees to his house, crying. SpongeBob starts driving wildly all over the course and sobbing, while Mrs. Puff, in a panic, tries desperately to stop him. SpongeBob is too distraught to listen and crashes the boat, failing the test and causing Mrs. Puff to inflate once again.

An emaciated Incidental 42 crawls in, claiming that he has not had any sustenance in three days. After confirming Incidental 42 can pay, Mr. Krabs has SpongeBob bring him a meal. However, Incidental 42 refuses, saying that there is no pizzazz in the Krusty Krab, and resumes searching for food, water, and atmosphere. Mr. Krabs remains skeptical, but then he overhears a conversation between Tom and Fred about a talking dog at the Shell Shack (unseen though) and realizes that what he needs is a gimmick to attract customers. SpongeBob tries to share an idea, but Mr. Krabs ignores him and decides instead to bury himself alive, which easily draws in a crowd. When news of the talking dog singing reaches them, though, they quickly leave leaving Mr. Krabs buried in the hole.SpongeBob remains ignored by Mr. Krabs, who desperately racks his brain for an answer, until he appears from the heavens heralding to Mr. Krabs his idea. Finally having his attention, SpongeBob shows him a green patty. Mr. Krabs is disgusted, thinking that the patty is spoiled, and tries to incinerate it. SpongeBob then removes his fire-proof suit to reveal Pretty Patties, Krabby Patties painted in ""six designer colors."" Mr. Krabs and Squidward laugh at this notion, mocking SpongeBob with other ridiculous novelties such as sequin milkshakes and bow-tie French fries. Deeply hurt, SpongeBob leaves his job as a fry cook and vows to open his own restaurant and prove them wrong, making them laugh all the more.With Patrick's help, SpongeBob sets up a stand in front of his house to sell his Pretty Patties, though it initially seems unsuccessful. He tries to give passerby Incidental 40 a Pretty Patty, who laughs at its green color. SpongeBob is about to give up when Incidental 40 notices a Patty in purple, his favorite color, and proclaims Pretty Patties to be the best idea ever.News of the skyrocketing sales of Pretty Patties reaches Mr. Krabs at a rundown Krusty Krab, who incredulously decides to take a look. There are thousands of customers surrounding the stand, clamoring for their turn. Mr. Krabs notes that he has never had a line before, much less the 46,853 customers that SpongeBob is currently waiting on. But to his shock, SpongeBob admits on TV he and Patrick didn't know what to do with the money they're making. They had thought about burying, shredding, or even burning it, all of which would disturb Mr. Krabs, but they set up a ""Free Money"" stand to give the money back to the customers so they can keep purchasing the Pretty Patties. Finally making it through the crowd, Mr. Krabs meekly congratulates SpongeBob on his success. While proud of what he has achieved, SpongeBob admits he misses his days at the Krusty Krab. Seeing an opportunity, Mr. Krabs persuades SpongeBob to give him the rights to his Pretty Patty stand in exchange for the key to the Krusty Krab. Utterly entranced with his fortune, SpongeBob starts frolicking inside and outside his new restaurant.The next day, as Mr. Krabs prepares to rake in the dough, the customers all angrily arrive, demanding refunds. They complain that the Pretty Patties had an unfortunate side effect: whatever color was eaten is what color part of the customer's body became. Incidental 42, demonstrating a glow-in-the-dark tongue while turning off the light, states that all 46,853 of them want their money back, but under the cover of darkness, the cheapskate Mr. Krabs has hightailed it.The customers form an angry, rainbow-colored mob and begin chasing Mr. Krabs, leaving a rainbow trail behind them. He runs to the Krusty Krab and attempts to unlock the door, but remembers that he gave his key to SpongeBob, who is currently preoccupied with the sound of his beloved squeaky pickles.

After that, Plankton gets into an argument with his computer wife, Karen, and he eventually spots Mr. Krabs' mother, Betsy, walking out of the Krusty Krab. Plankton falls in love with Betsy upon seeing her for the first time. Karen gets mad upon hearing that Plankton's apparently in love with another woman, but after Plankton discovers that Karen has an off-switch, he turns her off.Plankton and Betsy eventually start dating, and Mr. Krabs greatly disapproves of the relationship, convinced that Plankton is just trying to find out what the Krabby Patty secret formula is. He does his best to break up the relationship, but only gets scolded by his mother.Eventually, Mr. Krabs confronts Plankton at the Chum Bucket and accidentally gives Plankton an opportunity to find out the formula: as it would seem, Betsy actually does know the Krabby Patty secret formula, as it's an old family recipe. Krabs claims that Plankton will never know since he's not part of the family. Mr. Krabs leaves, and Plankton gets an idea and laughs to himself.At the restaurant, Betsy confronts her son on his actions as he explains his reasons before Betsy revealed that Plankton never asked her about the formula and didn't know she knew. Mr. Krabs then realizes in his rage, he let this info slip needlessly and becomes nervous. Betsy sends him to his office as punishment and he complies.Plankton arrives at the Krusty Krab and proposes to Betsy Krabs as Mr. Krabs begs his mother not to marry his enemy as Plankton gloats. However, Betsy turns him down, explaining that she's flattered, but not ready for that kind of commitment. In addition, the robot Plankton created shows up, and it's revealed that Betsy is dating the robot. Plankton gets mad and asks Betsy for the formula to call it even. Betsy realizes that Plankton was using her to be able to learn the formula and punches him back into the Chum Bucket.After being kicked out of the restaurant, Plankton bumps into the on-switch for Karen, turning her back on, and they get into another argument. When Plankton insults Karen, she immediately threatens him with a powerful laser as he tries correcting himself. However, Karen, who is still aggressive like a wasp at him for turning her off before, zaps him anyway as punishment before the episode closes.",Enemy In-Law,,2.08,"Luke Brookshier,Tom King,Tim Hill"

A patron is solving a crossword puzzle and realizes that he has lost his pen. A waitress says he can borrow hers, and he does. It then shows SpongeBob sitting at a table, he says he once lost something he could not live without: his identity.Even though no one asked or wants to know, he recounts the events of last Monday. In the flashback, he wakes up and throws his blanket into the air, and says ""Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it!"" The blanket falls on him, and SpongeBob, being unable to see, falls off of his bed, and his alarm clock falls on top of his head. He falls down the stairs and the alarm propels him into the window. He feeds Gary and comments that he has been feeding Gary snail food for years and does not even know what it tastes like. He tastes it and is revolted, and his screaming of disgust is sensed at the headquarters of the company that makes the snail food. He looks at the clock and realizes that he is late for work, and quickly gets changed and skips to work. While he is skipping to work, Patrick greets SpongeBob.After SpongeBob tells the diner people about greeting Patrick, he decides to skip to the part when he was about to serve a customer.As SpongeBob serves food to a customer, the customer tells him that he should wear a name tag so that she can thank him properly. He indicates that he is indeed wearing a name tag, but then realizes that his name tag is missing. He panics, hyperventilates, and eventually faints.When he wakes up, he asks Squidward what happened. Squidward tells him that he fainted because he lost his name tag, but he assures him that his name tag is not that important, and SpongeBob hyperventilates once again until Squidward stops him, saying it is not the end of the world. However, just as he says this, Mr. Krabs comes out of his office and informs them that there is a uniform inspection in one hour and anyone who fails has to wear a very stinky boot all day. Squidward suggests to SpongeBob that he should retrace his steps.SpongeBob repeats everything he did that morning several times, including his ""horrific incident of terror"" with the alarm clock and eating the snail food. SpongeBob repeats this many times since Patrick continuously fails to say ""Hi"" to him. As an example, Patrick accidentally says ""Hi, SpongeBoob"" and laughs afterward. Still, SpongeBob fails to find his name tag. Patrick then asks him what he did after he greeted him before noticing he lost his name tag, and SpongeBob explains that he skipped merrily to Krusty Krab, said hello to Old Man Jenkins, put an apple on Mr. Krabs' desk, and was thrown into a dumpster by two thugs. Patrick predicts his name tag is in the apple he placed on Mr. Krabs' desk. SpongeBob likes Patrick's prediction but claims Mr. Krabs has probably thrown that apple away by now, so Patrick suggests looking in the dumpster, and they go to search there.During the search, SpongeBob gives Patrick two hints but he is still confused. SpongeBob does a double-take of Jack Benny while wondering, but panics that he has one minute left. Patrick then sees SpongeBob's name tag on the back of his shirt, but when he alerts him to this and SpongeBob turns around, it seems to disappear and Patrick cannot remember where it was. SpongeBob gets irritated after he does this twice, and he soon tells Patrick to go home since he is no help. However, after an annoyed Patrick replies ""Well, at least I don't wear my shirt backwards!"" When SpongeBob hears this, he looks at his back and realizes that he had his name tag all along, and his shirt was supposed to correct to wear the pants not backwards on his name tag, and his shirt was just on backwards. At the uniform inspection, however, Mr. Krabs smells SpongeBob and is disgusted by the stench of the dumpster, and seemingly suspends him from working at the Krusty Krab.As the episode ends with SpongeBob finishing telling his story, thanking the waitress for listening and explaining that he managed to kill eleven minutes, calling her ""Betty,"" she says that her name is not Betty and that she is just borrowing someone else's uniform while hers is getting cleaned.

SpongeBob flies into one of the strong men, who gets angry, thinking SpongeBob is a piece of paper. He turns around to see who threw the ""paper"" at him, and SpongeBob gets scared because the man is intimidating and tough. SpongeBob covers it up by hiding until Sandy comes and he comes out. Sandy comes and asks what they are standing in line for and the man says they are waiting in line for The Salty Spitoon, the toughest sailor club in Bikini Bottom, which only the toughest fish can get in.The bouncer, Reg, allows Sandy in, as she is one of the toughest fighters in Bikini Bottom, but rejects SpongeBob because he is too weak. Reg suggests that SpongeBob should instead go to Weenie Hut Jr's and then Super Weenie Hut Jr's, much to SpongeBob's annoyance and humiliation. SpongeBob tries other methods, like telling him a story about how he painfully stubbed his toe while watering his spice garden and only crying for 20 minutes, wearing a wig to disguise himself, and posing as a tattoo on a man's arm. A drifter sponge shows up and Reg thinks it's SpongeBob in a wig, but the real SpongeBob shows up with a clown wig and Reg lets the drifter in.Finally, SpongeBob goes to Weenie Hut Jr's. The patrons talk about special days at the restaurant and the animatronic server meanly calls SpongeBob a weenie, annoying him in the process. The patrons then suggest ways for SpongeBob to prove his toughness and gain entrance to The Salty Spitoon. SpongeBob figures that the quickest way to do so would be to win a fight, but since he is not very strong, he decides to stage a fight with Patrick.The fight with Patrick is supposed to be the latter letting him win. They sling insults at each other to make the fight seem more realistic, but SpongeBob meanly calls Patrick ""Tubby,"" angering him and leading him to angrily attacking SpongeBob. The latter reminds him that he is supposed to let him win and Patrick proceeds to beat himself up as if there were an invisible person attacking him, even flinging himself into the background.Reg becomes amazed about SpongeBob beating up Patrick without even touching him and finally allows him to enter The Salty Spitoon. A joyful SpongeBob runs inside the club, but he clumsily slips on an ice cube and accidentally falls, leaving him injured and putting him in the hospital with Sandy accompanying him. He is initially  admitted to the Bikini Bottom Hospital, but while talking to the doctor, he refers to his injuries as ""boo-boos.""

Mr. Krabs does not believe this, and he tries to lure Plankton out. It fails, and Mr. Krabs decides to go to the store himself. He then confronts Plankton, and, in a fit of rage, he destroys many of Plankton's items.

They decide to dig it up, and they discover an old submarine. Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab, Squidward and Mr. Krabs think of an idea to bring the Krusty Krab to the customers. SpongeBob and Patrick drive the submarine into the Krusty Krab, which gives the idea to Mr. Krabs to have SpongeBob and Patrick take the submarine and sell Krabby Patties to any passersby. Seeing this, Plankton gets upset since he had the idea years ago. He takes the fist of the Chum Bucket and uses it as a mobile Chum Bucket.SpongeBob and Patrick are unsuccessful with their first customers, so SpongeBob offers to pay them to take the Krabby Patties, which they agree to. Meanwhile, Plankton attempts to sell food to a child, whom he then insults out of impatience. All of a sudden, the child's parents, great-grandmother, and various other fish start throwing rocks at Plankton after he insults them as well. Soon, the mob runs out of rocks, but since Patrick was not paying attention to the Krabby Patties, they burned and hardened. SpongeBob and Patrick are able to sell the burnt patties to the mob for them to throw, and the two friends head off.Later on, SpongeBob and Patrick fall into an abyss and wake up a ginormous sea monster who has been asleep for the past 79 years. Starved after his hibernation, the monster purchases 640 Krabby Patties. However, just as SpongeBob and Patrick are running out of patties, Plankton's Chum Bucket vehicle comes crashing into the submarine. Chum squeezes through the cracks of the submarine, so SpongeBob and Patrick decide to use the chum to make the burgers, which the monster ends up enjoying even more than the Krabby Patties. Plankton sees the sea monster hand SpongeBob and Patrick giant dollar bills in exchange for the chum burgers, and he attempts to get the monster to refuse the food. However, Plankton is mistaken for a chocolate éclair and the monster chases him away. Meanwhile, because they are down in the abyss, SpongeBob and Patrick have to let go of all the money they have earned to float back up to the surface.

Just then, Mr. Krabs excitedly announces that this particular dollar is his one millionth earned. After congratulating and thanking SpongeBob and Squidward, he says they are going on a surprise trip to celebrate. Squidward guesses they will be going to special places, such as Fancy Springs, Pamper Island, or Bikini Bottom Folk Village. To Squidward's dismay, however, they go clam fishing in a boat called the S.S. Cheapskate on a smelly brine lagoon.While fishing, SpongeBob accidentally hooks the back of Mr. Krabs' pants, which he has taped his millionth dollar to, and rips it off. Once the dollar is thrown into the lagoon, dramatic music played by a live-action orchestra starts up, giving SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs a dark warning that a giant clam is close by. As Mr. Krabs pleads for the orchestra to stop playing to no avail, SpongeBob frantically reels the dollar back into the boat, and for a few seconds, Mr. Krabs is happy at the dollar's safety. Next second, however, a giant blue-lipped clam suddenly jumps out of the lagoon, grabs the dollar from Mr. Krabs' claws, and swims away. Mr. Krabs starts sobbing and, after informing Squidward of what just happened, he falls into an uncontrollable crying fit, which an annoyed Squidward tries unsuccessfully to snap him out of. Finally, Squidward reluctantly promises to help Mr. Krabs get his dollar back. He is happy to hear this, and gives everyone supplies so that they can prepare themselves for catching the clam. Mr. Krabs then starts keeping a lookout for the clam.After three days, the clam still has not returned. SpongeBob and Squidward have grown tired of waiting, so they try to fool Mr. Krabs by giving him an ordinary dollar out of Squidward's wallet, which was all crumpled up, torn slightly, soaked in the lagoon, and kissed up with Coral Blue #3 Semi-Gloss Lipstick that SpongeBob used it. Mr. Krabs sees through their scheme and states that he will give a sandwich to whoever retrieves his dollar. He goes so far as to toss the other sandwiches and the entire fridge into the lagoon, making the sandwich the only piece of food on board. Squidward and SpongeBob realize that their boss has succumbed to madness and try to escape, only for Mr. Krabs to catch them and use them as bait for the clam.Soon, the dramatic music starts again, with Mr. Krabs being the conductor. The clam advances toward the boat with Mr. Krabs' dollar lying on his tongue. Mr. Krabs jumps onto the clam's tongue and grabs the dollar, only for the clam to shut its mouth and dive back into the lagoon. SpongeBob and Squidward are distraught until Mr. Krabs' head pops out of the lagoon.

SpongeBob is initially confused and then left heartbroken when Patrick ends their friendship, declaring they have ""grown apart."" Patrick actually has fun with Squidward and Sandy, bonding with them over music and mathematics, respectively, but quickly drives them both away with his patronizing attitude; Patrick cannot stand Squidward's less-than-stellar clarinet playing, telling him to find himself a new mentor and ends up insulting Sandy by implying she can't solve more sophisticated ""remedial equations,"" causing Sandy to order him to leave, but not before exclaiming that she likes him better as a ""barnacle head.""Since he is too smart even for them, Patrick begins to feel lonely over not having a friend to share his knowledge with. SpongeBob and Patrick sadly look over their scrapbooks together, leading Patrick to want to have fun with his best friend again. He tries many solutions to his problem, such as comparing his X-ray with SpongeBob's, meditating, doing research on Squidward, reading books about smarts, and even growing hair, but none of these things seem to work.Eventually, Patrick kidnaps SpongeBob and tries doing all of the things he used to do with him together, including jellyfishing and clam surfing, but cannot seem to regain his enjoyment. However, when SpongeBob mentions that Patrick stopped having fun after jumping from the cliff and knocking off his head, Patrick gets an idea. He redoes his actions by running through the wooden sign and falling off the edge again. When SpongeBob finds him at the bottom of the cliff, he is still smart. Patrick asks SpongeBob to confirm where his dislodged forehead was found the first time and uses his intellect to deduce where it actually landed when he fell.They discover that SpongeBob had in fact found brain coral rather than Patrick's forehead, explaining how he became so smart when it was attached to his head. SpongeBob asks if Patrick really wants his original forehead back, to which Patrick declares his newfound knowledge is not more important than friendship. SpongeBob puts Patrick's original head back, which renders him back to normal. SpongeBob and Patrick make loud, obnoxious noises and start giggling before running off together, ending the episode with the former happy to have his best friend back.",Patrick SmartPants,,2.73,"Casey Alexander,Chris Mitchell,Tim Hill"

He then shows him the number one inmate, Plankton, who went to prison for stealing the Krabby Patty secret formula. However, because his cell is not locked, he hides under Frank's mustache and escapes (the mustache becoming Plankton's hair).He returns to the Chum Bucket, only for Karen to kick him out (calling him a two-time loser, implying that he may have been arrested before and that she is fed up that he hasn't learned from it) and give him his old guitar. Plankton then hears SpongeBob singing about a Krabby Patty while censoring out the ingredients with noises. Plankton asks him to sing it uncensored; however, SpongeBob mistakes this as Plankton wanting him to join his band. Plankton rolls with it in hopes of stealing the formula.SpongeBob then runs into Patrick and decides to let Patrick join due to his ability to play his stomach like a drum. Squidward begins criticizing them due to their lack of musical talent. However, when asked to join the band, he accepts with the thought of becoming famous.SpongeBob, Patrick, and Plankton then start practicing while Squidward works out to look good. SpongeBob tells Patrick that he should dress with more pizzazz to look better for the band. Patrick shows SpongeBob his ponytail that he grew naturally. He then does tricks with his hair and grows more hair and sideburns.Plankton returns with band shirts naming their band ""Plankton and the Patty Stealers."" Despite this, they are still oblivious to Plankton's true intentions. They quickly start working on their music afterward.Patrick keeps the seats warm (literally, since he puts a fire under the seats) while Plankton takes out his ""recording equipment"" and tries to record SpongeBob's Krabby Patty song, but he is unable to find it and his equipment overloads when Patrick wears the headphones. Plankton breaks down crying since his plan failed, but SpongeBob gives him hope, as Mr. Krabs lets them play at the Krusty Krab, after-hours. Meanwhile, now having achieved his ""Perfect Dream Body,"" Squidward finally goes to practice.A week later, the band is all on their way to the Krusty Krab when a cop shows up in a police car. To prevent him from being recognized as an escaped convict, SpongeBob hides Plankton inside of his nose, disguised as a piece of dried nasal mucus. However, the police think nothing of it and drive off. The band then arrives at the Krusty Krab as Plankton unlocks the door.Plankton immediately starts searching for the formula while the rest of his band rehearses. SpongeBob notices this and soon realizes that the band was another one of Plankton's dastardly schemes and becomes furious. Plankton tries to prove his innocence but the police come and arrest Plankton for his escape.Now bald and imprisoned again, he is given a new cell inside of a safe. Plankton protests this act by voicing that he liked his old cell, but the guards slyly state they have a feeling that he'll ""love"" this one. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward visit him in prison, saying that their next performance would occur after his 22-year sentencing. The episode closes with them practicing and Plankton being tortured by it as he shrieks agonizingly.",Krabby Road,,4.70,"Luke Brookshier,Nate Cash,Eric Shaw"

Squidward becomes very annoyed, so he tells them to stop. However, they ignore him and continue singing, so Squidward goes to the door of the kitchen to yell at them, but just as he reaches the door, the door swings open as SpongeBob comes out singing, and it hits Squidward in the face. Squidward is in great pain, and yells at SpongeBob to take him to the hospital. At the hospital, SpongeBob is nervously pacing up and down and chewing on Krusty Krab hats, when Incidental 116 opens the door to the waiting room. SpongeBob bursts into tears and asks if Squidward is going to be okay, to which Incidental 116 replies by saying they will not know for two weeks.SpongeBob worries about his accident with Squidward for two weeks later, until Incidental 116 calls him into the hospital and give Squidward a bouquet of flowers. He gives one of the flowers to Mable, who is apparently suffering from amnesia, and then he walks into Squidward's operation room. Incidental 116 says that Squidward had asked to keep SpongeBob far away from him, but SpongeBob promises to stay out of the way. Just as Incidental 116 is about to cut the bandages, SpongeBob stalls him long enough so he can't see Squidward's face by interrupting him, saying to not rush it. He then interrupts a second time, asking if Squidward has enough ""emensmansera,"" to which the doctor says he has never heard of. SpongeBob then interrupts a third time, saying the readings on a brain meter (which is actually a television) are wrong, and a fourth time with a television program. SpongeBob interrupts once more as the doctor angrily wonders what the reason is as SpongeBob ironically says it was to apologize for interrupting him, and the bandages are finally cut. Squidward's face is so handsome it causes the doctor and a nurse to faint, and when Squidward looks in a mirror, he is thrilled to see he really is handsome. While Squidward prepares to leave the hospital, SpongeBob reminds him not to forget to enjoy being too handsome.As Squidward is walking through town, multiple fish see him, call him handsome, and faint. One fish crashes a car, an old lady regains the ability to walk, a blind fish regains the ability to see, and one fish becomes able to fly. Many fish begin taking photographs of Squidward, and one asks for an autograph. Squidward is enjoying the attention. A limo is waiting for Squidward and returns him to Squidward's house. Many fans follow the limo and take pictures of Squidward as he walks to his house. Squidward goes to sleep, while a group of fish is chanting 'handsome handsome handsome' outside his house all night. In the morning, Squidward remembers he is handsome, and goes out to greet the crowd, which has grown significantly over night. Suddenly, the fans start trying to take his shirt and eyelids, and Squidward rushes back inside. Squidward instead decides to play them a song on his clarinet, and the crowd cheers for him. But then, someone grabs his clarinet from him as he is leaning out the window, and that fish is attacked by the crowd who also want the clarinet.Squidward tries to take his mind off the incident by having an herbal bath, but someone reaches through the window and grabs his soap and Squidward calls the person out, saying that his grandmother gave him that soap. Squidward tries to enjoy his bath, but a huge fish emerges from his bath, and then fish start coming through his window, door, and even toilet, and try to 'get' him as a bunch of peeping toms. Squidward jumps out the window, but the crowd is still outside, and they start to approach him. He runs into SpongeBob's house, who is trimming his toenails, and Squidward begs SpongeBob to help him get his old life back. SpongeBob and Squidward cut through the crowd and run to the Krusty Krab, with the crowd chasing after them.When they arrive, Mr. Krabs is thrilled to see a crowd of people outside the Krusty Krab and tells the crowd they can pay to touch Squidward. Squidward asks SpongeBob to smash the door in his face before Mr. Krabs opens the doors to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob does not want to hurt Squidward on purpose, but Squidward tells SpongeBob to hurt him, or he will hurt SpongeBob, so SpongeBob repeatedly slams the door in Squidward's face. This ends up making Squidward even more handsome, then suddenly a shoe falls through a hole in the roof. Before it hits Squidward in the head, SpongeBob shoves him out of the way, and he stumbles face first into a pole. This returns Squidward's face to normal and the crowd leaves in disappointment. In an attempt to bring them back, Mr. Krabs repeatedly slams the door into Squidward's face to make handsome one last time, but to no avail, which ends the episode from there.",The Two Faces of Squidward,,4.08,"Charlie Bean,Aaron Springer,Steven Banks"

When he notices the air helmet she uses to help her breathe, he convinces her that he likes air too, despite not knowing what air is. Sandy tells SpongeBob to come over to her treedome for tea and cookies, and gives him a map of where her treedome is.SpongeBob goes to Patrick to tell him about what he went through. When Patrick hears from SpongeBob that Sandy wears a ""hat full of air,"" he misinterprets this as a statement that she ""puts on airs,"" and that he needs to be fancy by putting his pinky out. The next day, SpongeBob arrives to Sandy's home, but when he goes inside, he realizes the treedome is entirely filled with air. SpongeBob starts having trouble breathing and begins to dehydrate as a result, but will not admit this to Sandy.As Sandy is showing her house, SpongeBob attempts to use a birdbath to absorb water, only for the bird to angrily kick him out. Patrick reminds him to put his pinky out, and SpongeBob also brings flowers for Sandy. SpongeBob asks Sandy for water when she asks if he needs anything, but misinterprets this as needing a vase with water inside for the flowers. When Sandy leaves, SpongeBob desperately wants to get out of the treedome, but before he gets out, he remembers Patrick's advice, ""When in doubt, pinky out,"" and remains in the treedome despite being severely dehydrated.Sandy comes back with the water vase for the flowers, and attempts to start talking to SpongeBob again. When an oven timer inside her treedome goes off, Sandy leaves again. SpongeBob starts wondering if he needs the water in the vase, repeatedly telling himself he doesn't need it, but eventually relents. SpongeBob drinks all the water in the vase and bolts for the door, only for Patrick to come inside and prevent him from leaving. Patrick says that everything will be fine, but as he walks and stays inside the treedome, he starts choking due to the lack of water as well.The two attempt to get out, and when Sandy comes to them with some tea and cookies, she is shocked when she sees the two have dried up. Sandy quickly brings water helmets for them so they can survive in the treedome and tells them if they needed water, then they should've asked for it.

An elderly woman named Miss Gristlepuss enters the Krusty Krab with her accomplices, and being unhappy with what they see, they ban Krabby Patties.The Krusty Krab is closed down when Mr. Krabs, offscreen, was threatening Miss Gristlepuss with a french fry strainer and insulting her by calling her a disgusting old prune; not knowing that her husband, Al, is the police chief. Meanwhile, Plankton at first thinks Mr. Krabs has changed the name to ""The Closed Krab,"" but soon figures out he can take advantage of the moment and goes out to celebrate. Plankton soon discovers in surprise that the Krusty Krab has secretly been reopened at SpongeBob's house. Patrick, serving as a guard, asks Plankton for the password to enter, to which Plankton responds with a series of threats. Surprisingly enough, these threats constitute the password and Plankton is allowed in.While Mr. Krabs scans to make sure the area is clear of police officers, he goes to check on SpongeBob, who is afraid of getting arrested for making an illegal product. Mr. Krabs forces him to work, threatening to make him take weekends off. Plankton discovers Mr. Krabs is doing his regular business ""under the table"" and calls the cops.

After Squidward goes to his home, while he is sleeping, SpongeBob sits on his body, which freaks Squidward out. SpongeBob asks Squidward how does a person become normal, but he kicks him out in such furor. He proceeds to look at a video on How to Be Normal for Beginners in order to change his ways. At work, SpongeBob slowly changes over a three-week time period, becoming a more rounded-shaped sponge without holes, lacking his buck teeth, having a small nose, and big freckle-less cheeks. He also becomes milder mannered than his usual self.Along with his new appearance and personality, SpongeBob replaces his house with a new suburban home and works in a cubicle at the Krusty Krab like ""normal"" people do.

Then, the two run over the grave, and dirt gets all over the Dutchman's shirt. The green pirate ghost comes up, only to get his beard shaved off by the mower. The Dutchman becomes furious, so he stops SpongeBob and Patrick and starts yelling at them for their foolishness. The pair feel guilt at ruining the Dutchman's image, as SpongeBob explains they do not know what it is like to be a ghost. Therefore, the Dutchman turns them into ghosts until his beard grows back.The two fly over to Squidward's garden, and they try to scare Squidward, but they are sprayed by his hose.

Therefore, SpongeBob goes to the Krusty Krab for work, and goes to the kitchen. He picks up his spatula, but like his house key, it falls through. SpongeBob then breaks it, and its ghost comes out. However, when he flips patties, they fall through his spatula. He tries this repeatedly, but the spatula went straight through the patty and one of the patties burn. He goes straight through the door, sobbing. Patrick has problems, too. He explains that the food goes right through him, and Mr. Krabs and Squidward are grossed out.

This gives Mr. Krabs the idea to steal the chum recipe.That night, Mr. Krabs sneaks into the Chum Bucket trying to steal Plankton's recipe, but Plankton catches him with a security system that involves trapping him under a giant spoon (a likely reference to when he was trapped under one). SpongeBob then grabs Plankton and starts talking about the irony of the situation, but Plankton then uses the spoon security system on SpongeBob as well. After Plankton reveals the name of his system, Karen shows on screen that Nat is headed for the Chum Bucket with a fortune.However, when Nat arrives he throws the money at Karen and calls off a deal, announcing that he can't eat anymore chum due to it causing him get his stomach pumped twice before he collapses and is carried off by paramedics for his 3rd stomach pump. Once they leave, Karen reveals to a confused Plankton that she was bribing Nat to eat his chum so that he would stop complaining about having no customers. This causes Plankton to feel depressed once again, calling himself ""a waste of a lower life form"" (to which Karen tells him unsympathetically to cut it out) before crying. Meanwhile, SpongeBob mentions to Mr. Krabs about making a hasty retreat (they are still trapped under the spoons) but he decides to stay, enjoying and laughing at Plankton's misery as SpongeBob just watches stunned as the episode ends.",Plankton's Regular,,3.58,"Casey Alexander,Zeus Cervas,Dani Michaeli"

Patrick wishes to smell the flowers, but Squidward points out that he has no nose, much to his dismay. SpongeBob suggests he should have a nose implanted on his face, and so they go to a plastic surgery clinic known as Noses 'n Things.After the surgery, Patrick removes the bandages on his nose and is thrilled. He goes around town smelling several nice things such as perfume, pastries, freshly cut grass and deodorant. However, he soon comes across some rotten onion rings and is repulsed by the smell. Patrick runs home, but upon realizing how terrible his own house smells, decides to completely disinfect the place. After 2 days (48 hours), SpongeBob comes by and Patrick's nose picks up another bad scent. He traces it to Squidward's imported cheese and destroys it with a rocket gun.Patrick then goes and plugs up SpongeBob's sweaty holes as he is working out, stocks the Krusty Krab with scented candles and air freshener (chasing away all the customers), and sprays Sandy with air freshener. Fed up, the gang decides to have a meeting where they contemplate punishing Patrick via physical harm. SpongeBob stops them from doing so and tells them that it is not Patrick's fault: it is his new nose that is causing him to act like this. He suggests using something that smells so terrible, it will get rid of Patrick's nose.They bring a huge ball of garbage to Patrick's door, which causes his nose to shrivel up and disintegrate. Replying that he just wanted to be able to smell just like they can, Patrick runs away crying over the loss of his nose. At the funeral, SpongeBob feels quite regretful for getting rid of Patrick's nose, but Squidward remains unconcerned, declaring that at least Patrick will leave them alone, leading to Patrick saying ""I heard that!"" with large ears, as the episode ends.",No Nose Knows,,3.75,"Casey Alexander,Zeus Cervas,Derek Iversen"

Mrs. Puff then inflates so much, she sends the car airborne. SpongeBob then crashes the car into the lighthouse of the boating school, crippling Mrs. Puff for the rest of her life.In the hospital, the doctor clarifies that Mrs. Puff's inflation sac (the part that pufferfishes use to puff up) was popped in the collision and she will not be able to ""puff"" again. SpongeBob's joke about her being crippled makes Mrs. Puff furious and she begins grabbing his nose and threatening him, forcing him to apologize for his joke. She is tranquilized to stop her from hurting him. SpongeBob then begins to ramble, and the doctor tranquilizes him as well, saying that everyone needs to take a nap.SpongeBob then visits Mrs. Puff with a bouquet of flowers along with the hundreds of other flowers he sent her, which she appears to be allergic to. After forcing her into a wheelchair, he pushes her down the hallway. Doctors are seen sprinting through the hallway with muscular men on the gurneys.

He replies that the Demolition Derby members are about to battle in the hospital room, where they appear to be hitting each other with wheelchairs.

At the derby, SpongeBob is unaware of what he is supposed to do, which is to take out the opponents. Seeing him as an easy target, some competitors ram into him, but are unable to hit the car and are all hit by SpongeBob or destroyed in another way by the car.

Squidward then pokes his head in the kitchen window and yells at SpongeBob to go home since it is quitting time. SpongeBob is obliviously not paying attention to anything Squidward is saying. Immediately, SpongeBob's watch beeps and notices that it is quitting time. He asks Squidward why he is still here. When Squidward hears this and sees where he is, he screams in frustration and runs out of the Krusty Krab. Still in the kitchen, SpongeBob does not want to throw away a cooked patty, so he puts the patty in his wallet and saves it for later. SpongeBob then smells garbage and decides to take out the trash. While dumping the trash into the dumpster, SpongeBob notices a book covered in garbage and claims ""You shouldn't throw away books."" Suddenly, SpongeBob sees a big green slimy monster emerging from the dumpster. SpongeBob then throws the book at it, causing the slimy monster to fall over. The slime dissolves to reveal that it was actually Sandy. Sandy claims that she is was just trying to break the record for rooting around in a trash bin. Sandy shows SpongeBob the book he was holding is called The Guinness O'Ripley Enormous Book of Curiosities, Oddities, and World Records. She then shows SpongeBob some of the world records in the book and claims she wants to beat every record in that book.The scene cuts to Sandy's treedome, where SpongeBob and Sandy try to break the record for world's longest tongue. Sandy holds her hand on her door while SpongeBob pulls on Sandy's tongue. The record is broken after SpongeBob stretches her tongue up to 110 inches. The next record is to eat raw chum, so SpongeBob and Sandy go to the Chum Bucket and ask Plankton to give them raw chum. Plankton, however, warns them that no one can ingest raw chum and survive, but SpongeBob and Sandy do not care. Later in Sandy's Treedome, SpongeBob wears a special germ suit and gives Sandy a spoon of raw chum. Sandy then swallows it and freaks out. SpongeBob tells Sandy that she survived and broke the record. However, Sandy suddenly becomes subconscious from eating the raw chum. SpongeBob then takes off his water helmet and feeds Sandy the patty in his wallet he saved from work. Sandy recovers from her subconscious and says ""I can't wait to show them experts the pictures of my record-breaking feats."" SpongeBob suddenly realizes that he forgot his camera, and he goes home to get it.When SpongeBob returns, he sees Sandy's treedome filled with a bunch of robots. Sandy comes up to SpongeBob and asks him to take a picture of her throwing a woodchuck to break the woodchuck chuckin' world record. SpongeBob takes the photo of Sandy throwing a woodchuck and she breaks the record. Sandy at that occasion sends the woodchucks back to where they belong. Afterward, SpongeBob asks Sandy, ""What is all this?"" Sandy explains that she had constructed many robots to help keep track of her records and with careful planning and precise delegation of appropriate tasks so that she can manage the successful completion of the maximum number of records broken in the least amount of time. Sandy takes the picture of her throwing a woodchuck from SpongeBob and places it in the book. Sandy flips the page of the world records book to see what is next. The next record is the world's longest tooth. Sandy then asks one of the robots how the calcium fusion is going. The robot replies, ""It is ready, Miss Cheeks."" Sandy administers the shot, and her tooth grows. It continues to grow until she hits her head on the ceiling of the treedome. The robot uses a tape measure and reaches 35 feet, which breaks the record. SpongeBob takes a picture and tells Sandy to say ""Cheese!"" Sandy saws a giant part of the tooth off her top tooth and slides down.The next record is spiciest chili gargle. So, Sandy gargles on chili as SpongeBob takes a picture. Sandy gulps the spicy chilly and breathes out fire at SpongeBob. The next record is largest rubber band ball. SpongeBob takes a picture of the large rubber band ball as Sandy lets go of it, and SpongeBob gets crushed. The record after that is most cobras milked. SpongeBob takes a picture of Sandy milking the cobras. After that, the next record is most walnuts in mouth. Sandy gets a lot of walnuts in her mouth, SpongeBob takes a photo, and Sandy spits out the walnuts. After that record, the next one is most chainsaws juggled. The scene cuts to Sandy juggling chainsaws, with robots giving her more to juggle. SpongeBob takes a picture of her juggling the chainsaws and asks, ""How do you stop?"" To answer his question, Sandy stops juggling chainsaws and then runs like heck. However, SpongeBob accidentally gets cut into pieces by chainsaws because he ran the wrong way. SpongeBob puts himself back together and says ""It is getting kinda dangerous.""Sandy then takes SpongeBob and herself outside the treedome and shows SpongeBob the world's largest house of cards. Sandy and SpongeBob go up to the top of the house of cards so that they can take a picture. Meanwhile, Patrick is walking along and sees the house of cards is made with Solitaire cards. Patrick comes back with a baseball bat and hits the house of cards, causing the world's largest house of cards to collapse as SpongeBob and Sandy scream when they fall from the top. Thereupon, SpongeBob tells Sandy that he can smell Gary's sandbox and goes home to clean it.The scene changes to SpongeBob's house, where SpongeBob is cleaning Gary's litter box. While cleaning the litter box, SpongeBob tells Gary that he has broken the record for ""World's Stinkiest Litter box."" SpongeBob finds that Sandy has become obsessed with the record book and claims that the book must be destroyed. SpongeBob goes back to Sandy's treedome and disguises himself as one of Sandy's robots so he looks like the rest of the robots. SpongeBob then asks one of the robots if he can hold on to the record book, and the robot gives the book to him. Sandy does not recognize SpongeBob's robot disguise, and she puts him into a line where robots are getting destroyed to break the record for most robots built and destroyed in a day. While the robots are getting built and destroyed, a robot standing next to Sandy is counting the total amount of destroyed robots in order to break the world record. In the line of robots getting built and destroyed, SpongeBob in his robot disguise tries to sneak out of the line, but one robot grabs him and says ""We're all in this together."" SpongeBob and the robot both get crushed and are sent though a conveyor belt. Sandy finally breaks the most robots built and destroyed in a day. One of the robots comes out of the robot destroying the machine and says his stomach feels funny. Sandy looks inside his stomach and sees SpongeBob.The robot pukes out SpongeBob, and SpongeBob states he came to save her from the record book. Sandy says she is done with the book and she has beaten every record. A man who works for the book's company comes to see what Sandy has done but reveals that she has not actually broken any records. He explains that the book Sandy has was published thirty years earlier, so all the records in it had already been broken (several times over probably). However, the man adds that SpongeBob has set a new record: getting so many injuries from helping a friend. SpongeBob cracks into pieces and the author takes a picture.

A little later, SpongeBob decides to take the driver's test, and despite causing massive damage to other boats, the driving instructor decides to give SpongeBob his driver's license due to him wearing long pants and the blood flowing to the instructor's head (much to Mrs. Puff's horror).

Intrigued, they buy the toy and fly their brains around town to spy on citizens and pull pranks.After getting eggs thrown at them, a kid tells SpongeBob and Patrick that everyone has Whirly Brains and not just them. Patrick, SpongeBob, and the unnamed kid race, but SpongeBob and Patrick's brains land into an old man's house and he takes them as his own. After literally losing their minds, SpongeBob and Patrick (the latter seemingly figuratively losing his) begin to panic, as they cannot find their brains. SpongeBob and Patrick soon see other people who have used Whirly Brains have also lost their minds. With an idea, SpongeBob calls Sandy on the phone and she uses a missing brain detector to find the brains.Sandy's detector leads to the same old man who found their brains. She asks kindly, but the old man is snoring. However, Sandy just walks in and they try to look for the brains. The floor creaks and he wakes up, but Sandy puts a fight with the old man. SpongeBob accidentally trips onto the barrel, and all of the brains fly free, and all of them go back to their original beings.Sandy is about to threaten the old man, who immediately cries out an apology before revealing he hoarded the toys because he cannot stand seeing everyone have fun while he stands there with his cane. However, Sandy and SpongeBob hook the latter's propeller onto the old man so he can fly in the air too.It frightens the lady fishes, as they run around in circles at the Shady Shoals Rest Home building. Squidward then appears, going crazy thinking the Martians have landed. He ends the episode telling the viewer they are next.",Whirly Brains,,1.77,Doug Lawrence

SpongeBob says Marco and opens up a Bikini Bottomite, only to discover a kid who states he is Joshua. Then Patrick is seen with a group of old people, and the lifeguard says all Shady Shoals residents out of the pool. Clarabelle mistakes Patrick for her friend Mortimer and they both go out of the pool. Patrick realizes he is all wrinkled from the pool, and Clarabelle says everyone has them, and she calls them ""Oldie Foldies."" She then walks off mentioning prune ice cream, and Patrick runs after her chanting ""ice cream"" into a bus.SpongeBob, not knowing Patrick has left, continues to shout ""Marco,"" until a fish, who happens to be named Marco, runs into SpongeBob, which causes he and SpongeBob to get into a fight, because Marco is upset people shout his name without wanting him.The bus arrives at Shady Shoals and Patrick lifts all the Oldies out of the bus and into the building. Then Patrick devours all of the prune ice cream, has a brain freeze, and dies. A nurse rushes in and electrocutes Patrick with a defibrillator and his brain flies out. She then zaps his brain, and it catches fire. The nurse backs off and the smoke from the brain enters Patrick's nose. He then wakes up, squirts ketchup onto his brain, and then eats it.Then, there is a montage showing Patrick gradually getting more wrinkly and doing old people things, until he becomes a full blown old man.SpongeBob is in an alley, still shouting Marco, until Marco hops down from his apartment and threatens SpongeBob if he shouts his name again. SpongeBob then goes into a trance in order to become calm and tells the story of Marco's birth, until Marco starts screaming his name when SpongeBob says his parents are naming him, to which SpongeBob replies, ""polo."" Marco grabs SpongeBob and says he will beat up the next person who says his name wrongly, and throws him all the way to Shady Shoals, where Old Man Patrick is napping outside.SpongeBob, still with his eyes closed, taps Patrick and says it is his turn to say Marco. Patrick says he does not know who SpongeBob is, so SpongeBob re-enacts the SpongeBob SquarePants Theme Song until Patrick realizes who he is. Patrick says he is old now and shows SpongeBob all the things he does now. SpongeBob is disappointed and decides to show the oldies what it is like to be young again.First, they try to climb a tree, and fail. Then they dance, and fail. Finally, all the oldies start chanting Bunny Buns, so they all go into the restaurant. All the oldies act amiss until SpongeBob soon also becomes so over worked that he becomes all wrinkly and old. He tries to walk and then declares he is ""losing steam,"" falls on the ground, and steam shoots out of his holes. This steam gets Patrick moist and takes out his dry wrinkles.SpongeBob is napping outside, and Patrick gives him a blanket. SpongeBob then appears to die, and Patrick puts the blanket over him. SpongeBob then jumps out from the blanket, saying, ""Gotcha,"" and the camera pans away from them.Clarabelle and the oldies are playing Marco Polo, and Clarabelle says Marco, and Marco drops down from a tree, stating he is going to beat up Clarabelle. Clarabelle then flexes her biceps and punches Marco into the distance, and when he hits the ground he explodes, as the episode ends.",Old Man Patrick,,1.63,"Kaz,Dave Cunningham"

Patrick is the clown and tries to make a balloon animal for the kids. It turns out to be a giant ball of tied-up balloons. Patrick tells a kid that it is a rock, and the child flies away with the balloon. Mr. Krabs tells Squidward to go give the kids their Krabby Patties, which scares Squidward because of the many germs that the kids have. One of the children sneezes on the patties, and Squidward is disgusted by this, especially when the other children eat the patties, causing him to throw up.SpongeBob is seen as a bouncy house, while the kids hit a Plankton piñata. The birthday kid intentionally hits Mr. Krabs with the bat, instead of the piñata, causing money to fall out. Mr. Krabs angrily asks if he looks like a piñata, and the kid confirms this and leads the other children in a charge, causing Mr. Krabs to run. A child clad in spiked attire appears, and SpongeBob asks them to take off their spike-soled shoes. However, the child ignores the request, causing SpongeBob to burst.The Krusty Krew realizes the kids are too wild, (especially after seeing that they ripped Patrick's head off) so Mr. Krabs throws the birthday kid as his crew makes a break for it. As the four run away, they cross paths with Ms. Mildred, a wealthy woman who asks them if they are high-class caterers she hired for a party. Mr. Krabs, seizing the opportunity to make money, lies that they are and uses Squidward's ink to make them fancy tuxedos. Mildred pays them with a large check, and when SpongeBob questions Mr. Krabs' motive, the latter silences his employees by threatening to return to the chaotic birthday party. He then has them prepare for the party.The crew is mesmerized by the fancy sights and people as Squidward remarks that the high class would not believe their food is appetizing. Mr. Krabs agrees, and sends SpongeBob out to fancy the food. Krabs then looks around to see what people they are serving just as the birthday child appears in his clothes again, demanding his cake. Mr. Krabs then gets rid of the kid again when SpongeBob appears with Patties with gems embedded in them. Mr. Krabs questions this and the fry cook reveals he found a chest of gems to fancy the food, causing Mr. Krabs to admonish him for his actions of stealing as SpongeBob apologizes and tells him where he found them.Patrick serves the patties to the people, but after eating one of them himself, he goes on a wild streak and starts eating the patties reserved for the guests. Squidward spots a band performing for the party and, after stealing the clarinet from one of the members, he decides to join them. However, his terrible playing causes the other members to run away and, oblivious to his lack of talent, he pursues them.Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs tries to return the gems SpongeBob stole as the birthday child appears once more and threatens to light a series of fireworks if he is not given his cake. Krabs takes away the fireworks and reprimands the child for his dangerous actions as the child realizes his actions and then affectionately hugs him. However, Ms. Mildred calls Mr. Krabs, who throws the birthday kid down a laundry chute, and informs him of Patrick's actions. He promises to look into it after completing his original assignment.SpongeBob scolds Patrick for his crazy and foolish behavior and tries to stop him from eating the food, causing a chunk of it to fly into Squidward's clarinet. After he blows it out, the chunk hits a guest, resulting in a food fight between them. Mr. Krabs finally arrives at the room SpongeBob got the gems from and finds the birthday kid hopping on the large waterbed. He tries to stop him, but his pointy feet cause the bed to burst, leading to a large flood.During the food fight, Ms. Mildred tries to calm her guests, but is caught up in it herself. Mr. Krabs runs from the large rushing of water as Ms. Mildred chases him for his actions, but she is swept away by the flood along with SpongeBob and the guests. Mr. Krabs trips on a chunk of the patty, which launches him in the air a chandelier and ignites the fireworks he took from the birthday kid. Mr. Krabs is shot out of the mansion as Squidward and Patrick flee behind him, and the flood follows them.The birthday kid is shown surfing on Mr. Krabs' check just as he is hit with his birthday cake while Krabs is upset about his check's location and Ms. Mildred complains about her party being ruined. SpongeBob is shown as a bouncy house again and laughing at the events while the kid with the balloon ""rock"" screams as he is floating around the scene, as the episode ends.",Krusty Katering,,2.12,Ben Gruber

While caught up in himself, Squidward is interrupted by SpongeBob on his unicycle. Reluctantly, Squidward allows SpongeBob to come with him. SpongeBob lets Squidward ride with him to the hospital.Squidward goes into his hospital room, with SpongeBob closely following. SpongeBob realizes how drab the room is and brightens it up with plushies and flowers. Irritated, Squidward yells at SpongeBob and tells him to go volunteer to be a candy striper. SpongeBob grabs his uniform and eats the literal candy strings on it. A couple of doctors passing by see SpongeBob in his white shirt and mistake him for a doctor and tell him to come along and help them. They bring SpongeBob into a room with a catfish. The catfish tells them in a gravelly voice that his throat hurts. SpongeBob reaches into the fish's neck fold and finds a clump of dirt. He then reaches into the catfish's mouth and pulls out some car keys. SpongeBob then explains how the fish is a bottom feeder and how they probably ate the keys in a search for food, stating that this also happens to his best friend, Patrick, all the time.SpongeBob is then moved into another room with an athlete with broken legs. The athlete asks if he will be able to run in an upcoming marathon. One doctor begins to say, ""no,"" but SpongeBob insists he can fix it. He grabs a nearby skeleton model and shoves it inside of the patient. The patient's legs are healed and he runs out of his room. The two doctors are amazed. As a result, they bring SpongeBob into the final room.The room contains a deflated Mrs. Puff inside of an iron lung. SpongeBob mistakes the lung for a submarine and hops on top of it. He starts pushing and pressing levers and buttons and the Lung streaks down the hallway. It crashes into the end and shoots out a puffed up Puff. She thanks him for helping her recover, but says he still will not get a driver's license.The doctors are befuddled and allow SpongeBob to perform surgery. The surgery patient ends up being Squidward. SpongeBob tries several different noses, but Squidward does not like any of them. SpongeBob then reverts his nose back to normal, but says he needed the rest of his body to make it, much to Squidward's horror. SpongeBob now has to leave for work, but the doctors tell him that he already is. However, SpongeBob tells them that his actual job is a fry cook, and he walks to the Krusty Krab. Squidward then says to the female nurses that he is on the market and single, much to their shock and disgust.",Code Yellow,,1.69,Andrew Goodman

Mr. Krabs is bothered by this, beliving this excess would lead him to bankruptcy within the next four hundred and eleven years. Therefore, he assumes that SpongeBob is an insomniac, so he sends him home to get some shut-eye.However, SpongeBob has a hard time sleeping, so he goes to Patrick's house. Patrick tries to help SpongeBob fall asleep by reading what SpongeBob assumed was a bedtime story. However, the story, The Land of Perpetual Excitement, was meant to get people out of bed, the opposite of SpongeBob's goal. Then, Patrick sings SpongeBob a ""lullaby,"" which is really a wake-up song, as it is sung loudly as the song goes on, with the lyrics stating to ""get up"" and ""be active."" Then Patrick gives SpongeBob some ""medicine,"" which turns out to be coffee, and as a result, it keeps SpongeBob wide awake.After realizing he drank coffee, as well as realizing that Patrick barely helped him get some sleep, SpongeBob starts running around and seeing things, such as an anthropomorphic bush, a talking glass of milk, a bunch of Squidwards, Mr. Krabs with mustard releasers as eyes, reflecting the previous day, etc. The next thing he sees is a bird resembling Gary carrying him to a giant version of Patrick and eats him, thinking he is a sponge cake. Inside Patrick, SpongeBob sees a sunrise. He begs it to let him sleep for just five minutes before he meets Sir Cecil the sleep wizard. Sir Cecil puts sleepy dust on SpongeBob, then he falls asleep. When SpongeBob wakes up in Gary's litter box, realizing that the whole thing was a nightmare, he snaps back to reality.Realizing he is late for work, a very tired SpongeBob goes to the Krusty Krab, only to sleep in a barrel of mustard. Mr. Krabs takes him out of the barrel of ruined mustard, and wonders why he could not sleep. SpongeBob explains that his ""insomnia"" got the best of him. Then, he starts crying tears made of mustard. He cries the perfect amount that is needed to be on the Krabby Patties. However, even though Mr. Krabs is okay with the act, he immediately berates SpongeBob for doing so, making SpongeBob more dismal, causing him to cry out more mustard, to the amusement of Squidward.",InSPONGEiac,,2.02,"Casey Alexander,Zeus Cervas,Doug Lawrence"

They soon notice that their avocado house is rotting and quickly run outside just in time before it melts. While they wait for their house to be grown again, they decide to stay with SpongeBob. SpongeBob receives the call from his parents at his house and realizes that they haven’t visited him in a while, so he thinks that he needs to mature himself to thoroughly prepare for their visit.SpongeBob cleans his house as part of the preparation, with Patrick randomly appearing every time. When his parents arrive, SpongeBob maturely greets them and lets them come inside the house. SpongeBob's parents soon arrive, ready to hang out with him for his youthful nature, but soon find him acting mature. SpongeBob gives his parents an agenda of ""adult"" activities to do for the day. Harold is about to question him, but Margaret agrees for them to go along with the agenda. After the activities, SpongeBob places them in bed at 4:00 pm.Harold and Margaret don’t like SpongeBob's new personality, so they decide to sneak out of the house while SpongeBob is sleeping.

SpongeBob first thinks that they will just skate through the rink, but his parents actually plan to skate across the town. SpongeBob chases them through various locations in Bikini Bottom, eventually heading back to SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob gets angry at his parents for acting wild when he just wanted to impress them, resulting in him going crazy and being flung through the house from the pressure of the soda bottles equipped to him.

When the day is finally over, he rushes to get to his house, but is stopped by Mrs. Puff, as she needs him to fix her flat tire. After doing that, he continues rushing to his house, only to get stopped by Patrick, who needs him to find his rock at the Impound Yard. Afterwards, Sandy needs him to do a chore, but after he hears two fans of Mermaid Man talking about how no real fan would miss the show, he leaves Sandy and continues rushing to his house.However, SpongeBob is constantly stopped by several people as they need him to do their tasks. SpongeBob finally goes back home, hoping that he can at least watch the recorded version, only to see his VCR going haywire and all the other things he set up getting ruined and bursting into flames, which sets his house on fire. He cries so loudly everyone can hear him, and his friends feel guilty for taking advantage of SpongeBob.To compensate for this, they bring SpongeBob, who is in a depressed state, to see a live performance of the episode on an amphitheater. SpongeBob loves their show and thanks them for showing the love they had for him to make up for missing his show. The episode ends with Old Man Jenkins asking everyone what they are doing at his amphitheater, but this makes everyone run away, despite him just wanting to have a role in the play.",Appointment TV,,1.25,Andrew Goodman

The Dirty Bubble is seen to have already tied Al Gristlepuss onto an aerial. He threatens the Bikini Bottomites that he will eat the police chief unless they act for him. Perch Perkins comes up to make a further statement on the Dirty Bubble's predicted actions. However, the Dirty Bubble strangles him with his tongue, ready to eat him. Just as he is about to eat Perch Perkins, the police come up to the radio station top to grab the Dirty Bubble with bubble wands, ordering him to drop Perch Perkins. The Dirty Bubble is then arrested and placed into a glass jar.After the Dirty Bubble serves his 6-month pretrial release, he is released as the Clean Bubble. The Clean Bubble feels refreshed as a new self. The warden warns him that he must ensure his cleanliness or else he would become evil again. Afterward, the Clean Bubble is released to work at the Krusty Krab. He assures he will not become dirty.When the Clean Bubble reaches the Krusty Krab, he is excited to work there. He wants to work as a waiter or a cash register. However, Mr. Krabs assigns him a cleaning job of washing dishes. SpongeBob, who comes back from the freezer to cook some patties onto the grill, greets him. The Clean Bubble refers to himself as ""DB.""The Clean Bubble begins scrubbing the dirty dishes, which causes him to turn back into the Dirty Bubble. He surprises SpongeBob at his sudden return. SpongeBob, thinking that the Dirty Bubble kidnapped the Clean Bubble, threatens to wash him down with the sink hose, then sprays out water at the Dirty Bubble. SpongeBob noticed that the Dirty Bubble became the Clean Bubble, and realizes that ""DB is short for Dirty Bubble."" The Clean Bubble tells him that he is trying to change his personality by staying clean. SpongeBob assures that he will promise to keep him squeaky clean. He gives a handshake to him.Mr. Krabs reveals to the Clean Bubble that his new job will be to scrub the dirty toilets. SpongeBob assures that he will clean the toilets. The Clean Bubble stares in the toilet and hallucinates over ""beautiful"" dirt. He goes into the toilet to transform slowly into the Dirty Bubble. He then causes havoc to people in the toilet. SpongeBob runs off and spits out absorbed sink water onto the Dirty Bubble to transform him to become clean again. Elaine then reports in comic book form about SpongeBob's continual duty to prevent Clean Bubble from turning into the Dirty Bubble.Back at the Krusty Krab, the Clean Bubble is a waiter for the customers. SpongeBob compliments him for not being dirty for weeks. But Patrick comes in to mention more about dirtiness, specifically his dirty belly button gunk. He flicks it to the Clean Bubble by pure unawareness, and accidentally reformed the Dirty Bubble. The Dirty Bubble came out to cause even more havoc in Bikini Bottom. Patrick considers this transformation special, but SpongeBob knows it means trouble.The Realistic Fish Head reports again on the Dirty Bubble's re-premise, stating that the Dirty Bubble has come back to do dirty deeds to some Bikini Bottomites. Some of these include ruining a perfect mud bath for two kids, turning a pirate into a chubby sailor, smashing a building cleaned by himself, and literally wiping out an old teacher's face in Poseidon Elementary. Afterward, the Dirty Bubble inverted Perch Perkins' face, after Perch Perkins reported about wiping out the teacher's face.SpongeBob attempts to hose down the grime off the Dirty Bubble, but the grime is too strong. The Dirty Bubble eats the hose and attacks SpongeBob with five miniature Dirty Bubbles. SpongeBob eventually pops them all, leaving the Dirty Bubble slightly stumped. SpongeBob launches himself toward the Dirty Bubble to try to pop him with his spatula, but bounces off. He chases after SpongeBob and eats him to trap him. The Dirty Bubble decides to eat Goo Lagoon next.SpongeBob, struggling to escape the thick walls of the Dirty Bubble, grabs out his pencil to write down his last words, knowing that he will eventually drown in the accumulating Goo Lagoon goo. However, knowing that he is able to absorb liquids from his surroundings, begins to spin around the Dirty Bubble. Dirty Bubble tells him to stop spinning, but fails to stop him, and eventually became absorbed into SpongeBob. SpongeBob burps out a tiny version of the Dirty Bubble.Just as the Dirty Bubble tries to cause more trouble as a small bubble, the police arrest him by trapping him in another jar. The lady officer thanks SpongeBob for contributing to the Dirty Bubble's arrest. SpongeBob sneezes the entirety of Goo Lagoon's goo everywhere, much to the anger of the officers.

Thinking all hope is lost, she locks herself in the restroom and cries violently.SpongeBob then decides to simply hide the barnacles under a layer of facial cream, which ends up making Pearl's face look severely deformed and causing her to be unable to talk. Finally, Pearl asks SpongeBob to get her more soap from the basement's soap press, where he finds Mr. Krabs producing the house's soap. Mr. Krabs explains to SpongeBob that he makes all of his soap out of leftover Krabby Patties.

He gives Mr. Krabs a fortune of money to take SpongeBob to his restaurant. Despite SpongeBob not wanting to leave the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs finds the manager's offer too good to turn down, as the manager leaves with SpongeBob.At the tryouts kitchen, the manager gives SpongeBob and three other chefs cooking tests to decide who will be his chef at the stadium, with those who are eliminated forced to sell hot dogs on the freeway. The manager first assigns the chefs to cook soup. The sea turtle sabotages SpongeBob and the eel chef, but SpongeBob soon gets the idea to use his tie, and he dips it in his soup. As the manager judges the soups, he eliminates the eel chef after noticing the nails that were poured by the sea turtle as sabotage. At the end of judging, he declares SpongeBob the winner of the round.The manager's next test for the chefs is pizza. The sea turtle apologizes to SpongeBob for sabotaging him earlier, but he proceeds to trick him with a ""special pizza dough"" made of chewed gum. The shrimp chef tries to issue payback to the sea turtle, who threw nails at him prior, by putting nails on his pizza, but the sea turtle notices him. The manager soon proceeds to judge the pizzas and eliminates the sea turtle after noticing the nails on his pizza. The sea turtle declares revenge on SpongeBob while he is eliminated. The manager tastes SpongeBob's pizza, which had the shrimp chef inside. The manager complements the pizza for its unique flavor and declares SpongeBob the winner of the competition.At the Culinary Stadium, SpongeBob prepares to go on. SpongeBob manages to handle the orders with his skills and precision, but unbeknown to him, the sea turtle shows up at the stadium with a timed bomb, attempting to once again sabotage SpongeBob. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs and Squidward arrive and are surprised that only the wealthy customers get to eat the food SpongeBob eats while everyone is forced to sit and watch the show.

Krabs gives him a mop and tells him not to leave until the place is spotless. SpongeBob starts picking up some trash, but does not get very far and wishes that he had a friend to help him clean up. Suddenly, a magical janitor named Sammy Suckerfish drifts in on the winds to offer his assistance. Through a song, Sammy explains that his preferred cleaning method is by using his tongue to lick the entire place clean. SpongeBob tries to get into it, but he has to have Sammy tie up his nose to be able to handle the taste. They both manage to clean up the entire dining room and kitchen with their tongues.Next, they lick the bathroom clean, but the graffiti on the stall door is really stubborn. Sammy uses his magic soap to turn himself and SpongeBob into graffiti drawings who drive the other graffiti away. Sammy then uses his mop to sniff out other dirt, which ends up being in Krabs' office. He cleans the room by licking up everything, including the safe and secret formula, with the printing of the formula getting stuck to his tongue. While chasing Sammy, SpongeBob accidentally trips an alarm that alerts Krabs, who thinks Plankton is attacking. Krabs arrives and thinks Sammy is Plankton, until the real Plankton shows up and teams up with Krabs to stop Sammy. Sammy splits his mop up into smaller versions and licks everywhere while singing, turning the place even cleaner.SpongeBob and Krabs catch Sammy and point out a spot of dirt on his face. He decides to clean himself by licking up his body, removing everything except his face. Before he goes, he spits out the secret formula from his tongue onto SpongeBob's face and gives him his hat. Plankton takes a picture of the formula on SpongeBob's face, but Sammy's mops eat the picture chase him away. SpongeBob wipes the formula back onto the paper and Krabs comments he hopes it’s clear why he doesn’t want SpongeBob to let strangers in the Krusty Krab ever again.

That morning, Plankton had shown up in a baby basket right outside the house and got himself adopted by the SquarePants family. Saying that brothers do not keep secrets, Plankton tries to get SpongeBob to tell him the Krabby Patty secret formula, but SpongeBob wants to have bonding experiences first.They go out and play catch, where Plankton is repeatedly squashed by the baseball. He asks to share secrets, but SpongeBob claims their ""brotherly love meter"" is not yet full and suggests they bond through helping their neighbors. They offer to do housework for Baby Prunes and Mary, who tell them to mow their kelp lawn. Plankton starts the lawn mower while SpongeBob steers it, but Plankton ends up getting shredded by the blades, and they are paid a nickel for their work.As they head to the junkyard, Plankton has had it with SpongeBob's bonding and is about to give up, when they stop outside the clown college. An angry clown shows up and threatens Plankton, but SpongeBob saves him by getting in the way of the clown's foot and bouncing him away. Plankton is touched and accepts SpongeBob as his big brother. They go out to do more activities, such as visiting the zoo and going jellyfishing.They finish by watching the clouds outside SpongeBob's parents' house. Plankton confesses that while he had a lot of siblings growing up, none of them were nice to him like SpongeBob is. SpongeBob feels ready to share secrets, when Plankton confesses he only acts tough because he does not want the world to hurt him, but he is afraid of pushing everyone away and ending up alone. SpongeBob is about to share his own secret, and Plankton expects to hear the secret formula. However, SpongeBob just says that he never learned how to tie a tie and wears a clip-on.Plankton is outraged and explains his plan, when SpongeBob says he keeps the formula locked up in his brain.

When it does, Kevin suddenly abandons SpongeBob and runs away, saying he does not know how to catch it and the video he supposedly made was staged on a green screen. SpongeBob tells Kevin that this is his chance to catch it and prove he actually is a good jellyfisher. They ambush the moon jelly, but are unable to catch it. They get tired while outrunning it, so SpongeBob comes up with a plan: trapping it by disguising himself as a wedge of cheese to lure it into an alleyway.In the alleyway, Kevin and SpongeBob corner the jellyfish, but clouds begin covering the moonlight and SpongeBob is afraid it will get away. Patrick, the townsfolk, and the others on the Jellyson Group all pull their pants down and show their butts at the jellyfish, reflecting the moonlight and stunning it.

When Patrick starts laughing, SpongeBob laughs along with him; the years of excessive laughing cause SpongeBob's funny bone to get stuck in high gear, making him laugh uncontrollably. His laughing annoys the rest of the moviegoers and the usher kicks him out. SpongeBob cannot stop his laughing and tries to hold it in, but this does not work.As SpongeBob tries to go back home, he sees a man wearing a funny hat and laughs, mistakenly offending him. He then laughs at a milkman crying over spilled milk. The next day, he goes to work and tries to stifle his laughter. He runs into Squidward and laughs at his face, and locks himself in the storage room so nobody will hear him. However, the vents carry his laughter into the dining room, making everyone leave. Mr. Krabs comes in and tells SpongeBob to stop, but Lady Upturn and Fifi enter, angered that nobody has taken their order. Fifi swipes a patty from the grill and Lady Upturn is pulled by her, making SpongeBob laugh. Mr. Krabs kicks him out, although SpongeBob claims he is not laughing on purpose. Fifi attacks him and he leaves the restaurant.SpongeBob runs through town, laughing. He locks himself in a dark building, hoping that there will be nothing to laugh at, but he ends up in a hospital operating room. As a doctor operates on a robot, his tears of laughter short circuit the robot and make it attack the doctor and nurse. He runs away and finds himself unable to stop laughing, deciding to go to the cemetery so nothing will make him laugh. However, he ends up at a clown funeral, which he finds funny. The supposedly dead clown comes to life, making SpongeBob laugh. He leaves but trips over a stand with a flower wreath. It makes the clown sneeze and his nose explodes, and SpongeBob runs away laughing.Hours later, SpongeBob's laughter has made his mouth take up his entire face. He sees a movie called Weep playing in theaters, which consists of people crying, and decides to watch. However, he starts laughing, driving the patrons away. He runs into his grandmother, who claims that she also got her funny bone stuck at SpongeBob's age, and it happens to everyone in the family. Accepting that laughter is a part of his family, SpongeBob sits next to his grandma and laughs at the movie with her. Patrick is crying at the movie, but only because he ran out of popcorn.",Don't Make Me Laugh,,0.20,Doug Lawrence

As he clings to the underside of the board, Patrick pulls the lever out and sends the board falling. Squidward slams into the surface of the water as SpongeBob and Patrick compliment his dive.

Krabs tells him to keep cooking with one of the dirty, greasy replacement spatulas in the kitchen, but SpongeBob wants to use his own spatula instead. Threatened with SpongeTom taking over his job if he does not find another way to cook, SpongeBob heads off to the Mystical Misty Mountains to find Guru Greasetrap and repair his spatula.SpongeBob starts climbing the mountain, and loses his backpack when he sets it down and it causes the rock to collapse. He meets Rube, who is giving tours. Rube helps SpongeBob cross a rickety bridge, but then leaves when his shift is over. SpongeBob continues climbing to meet the guru on the mountaintop. Greasetrap knows why he is here, and goes to get his hammer and anvil to reforge the spatula. When SpongeBob tries to help him, he accidentally drops anvils on Greasetrap's hands, severely injuring them. After being told that the true spatula is ""inside him,"" which he does not understand, SpongeBob is left to learn how to reforge it himself.Greasetrap gives SpongeBob a few training exercises, which he cannot get right. However, his determination leads Greasetrap to let him try it. SpongeBob melts his spatula's parts into metal, pours it into a template, hammers it flat, and cools it down with snow, restoring it completely. So he will not be late, Greasetrap kicks him down the mountain, making him roll into a snowball and crash into the Krusty Krab.SpongeBob crashes on top of SpongeTom, who was almost taking his job. However, when he tries flipping a patty, his spatula immediately breaks. He remembers Greasetrap's words that the spatula is inside him, and uses his hands to prepare the patties instead. In the process, he injures them and has them wrapped in casts, like Greasetrap. When Greasetrap visits, he realizes that SpongeBob had misunderstood his advice: lifting up his body reveals the spatula literally contained inside of him.

The story's narrated by Fishmael Tentacles, an ancestor of Squidward, looking for work from town to town, ending up in a seaside town. He comes across and subsequently slips on jellyfish jelly, leading him into The Jelly Squirt Inn, landing right at the bar's counter, meeting an old-timey Capn' A. Krabs and a parakeet version of Plankton named Planky. Planky offers him some jelly, but Fishmael explains that he's only here to find an occupation, suggesting a potential career as a cashier to Krabs. Unfortunately, Fishmael is denied of a job - but thankfully for him, Pat-Buck snatches him under a table and tells him of a gig as a crew member on Captain SpongeHab's pineapple ship. Fishmael refuses to work on a ship, thinking it's too low-brow, but Pat-Buck ignores his reply, knocks him out, and kidnaps him.Fishmael finds himself on SpongeHab's quarters, and Pat explains that the captain has a special job for him, so the star shows him the ""ropes,"" literally, going on with teaching him. All of that ropey education was only meant for Fishmael to be tied up to the ship's pole with his tentacles, and Pat-Buck along with the rest of the sailors (jellyspotter anchovies) frolic around enjoying themselves. That is, until Captain SpongeHab enters the scene with a frightening presence, telling the crew all about great-white jellyfish Dopey Dick with bubble-gum imagery, and saying to give him a holler if they see him. Quickly enough, Dopey's spotted and the crew scrambles to catch him. SpongeHab tells Fishmael he's got a special job for him, and it ends up being used a harpoon to reel in the jellyfish. Dopey and Fishmael are on a wild chase for quite a while, so Fishmael uses his awful recorder-playing skills to calm Dopey down. This ends up working, and Dopey is caught and pulled just above the ship's platform. SpongeHab then shows the crew the best part of hunting down and catching a jellyfish - releasing it. The anchovies and Pat-Buck are initially disappointed, but it later warms their heart. Everything seems like it's off to a good conclusion, but it abruptly comes to a pause when Dopey is hooked in by another ship.That ship turns to be the ones owned by Capn' A Krabs and Planky, who instead of catching and releasing Dopey Dick, plan to exploit his jelly and kill him off. SpongeHab, Fishmael, and Pat-Buck angrily rebel against this, but the anchovy sailors quickly switch sides and Planky destroys the near entirety of their ship with the power of nematodes. Despite all the destruction, SpongeHab still wants to save Dopey, and Pat-Buck is commanded to use his oar and follow the evil duo who kidnapped the great-white.Day turns to night, and the crew quietly sneaks onto Krabs and Planky's ship while they're asleep and rescue Dopey Dick, who thanks them and escapes. Their plans are immediately foiled when the opposing crew awakes, and they seem doomed, but Dopey snatches them from the ship. Krabs and Planky try to harpoon Dopey back onto the ship, but the jellyfish turns around and rams into it, leaving the boat destroyed. Krabs and Planky try to avoid Dopey in the ocean, but their harpoons leave them tied onto him when brought out of the water. After a day of complete mania, a frightened Fishmael states that he doesn't want to work with SpongeHab anymore, causing the sponge and Pat-Buck to laugh. Dopey then jumps into the remains of Krabs and Planky's ship, creating a whirlpool and leaving Fishmael as the lone survivor of ""Dopey Dick.""The scene cuts to Fishmael back at the Jelly Squirt Inn, turning out to be a story that he told all along. Everyone at the inn laughs at how he over-exaggerates himself as the hero, as they were all there themselves. Fishmael angrily leaves the inn, and everyone gets another round of jellyfish jelly on the house. Dopey Dick squirts jelly to all of the inn's customers, even Fishmael, who grumpily stands outside. Dopey subsequently closes the book he opened in the beginning of the episode and Fishmael states ""The End,"" concluding the segment.",Dopey Dick,,0.19,Doug Lawrence

Suddenly, the duo hear stomping noises, and Jack hides in the goose's holes.

He sets the goose on a nest and Krabs brings out SquidHarp to play music so SpongeGoose will dance - which causes it to lay out edible, gold Krabby Patty. Jack's thrown out of Sponge's holes and stepped on, but soon encounters another golden patty. He attempts to escape with it, but Krabs realizes and quickly catches him. The giant feeds Jack to SpongeGoose, but he quickly escapes through the power of Sponge's holes.

Unfortunately, Giant Krabs is still climbing down the beanstalk for revenge, but Jack breaks the storybook mold and shoots out a laser, cutting the beanstalk, causing Krabs to fall and crushing his house.Later, Jack is shown to be just fine, using Krabs' shell and SpongeGoose's golden patty-laying powers to create a successful business for himself, with SpongeGoose joyfully frolicking and serving customers.

Squidward is kicked out by an angry mob, and finds himself heading to the streets of Bikini Bottom, where he attempts to prove his musical talent to the public once more - which creates more mass damage, even to the point where buildings collapse. When planning to continue his routine ""one more time,"" he's interrogated by the music police, getting his clarinet evicted and forced to take mandatory music education at Little Flipper Music Academy.Squidward finds himself degraded in music class, and his attempts to act rebellious (sitting at the back of the class so no one can see him) or a superior (introducing himself as a musical genius) are futile, being foiled and made fun of. Shortly after this, a new student pops up in class, and it turns out to be SpongeBob himself, only making Squidward more miserable. All of the students are then asked by their teacher to play their instrument so she can indicate their skill level. Most of the students prove to be equally awful, except SpongeBob, as his ""flute-nose"" technique proves to be the most superior of all of them, even getting the other students excited enough to follow him around. Squidward then has to play his clarinet, belted to a stroller following its eviction. His talents are worse than ever, audibly torturing all of the students. Meanwhile, SpongeBob once again performs his ""flute-note"" music to the class, and all of the other students join him and form a mini-band. Squidward tries to join in with their tune, being given lots of different instruments, but ends up being progressively worse and worse at each of them. After trying to a play a broom that starts a fire (subsequently getting extinguished), Squidward's arrogance and stubborn attitude leads him take back his clarinet, creating a musical tornado that throws almost everyone out of the school. The music cops soon surround the department, and demand Squidward to stop playing, to which he refuses.In response, the cops call in a robot maestro, which shoots a cork into Squidward's clarinet, putting an end to his turbulent tornado. Squid's put under musical arrest, and his clarinet's shredded to nothing but wood. He sobs to himself, thinking that he'll never play music again. While trying to comfort Squidward, SpongeBob gives him a tissue that when sneezed out, creates trumpet-esque noises. It turns out that Squidward finally found out his musical talent, with his music being loved by everyone. The school's teacher declares Squidward as the most improved student in the class.

Snail Fail continues to hit Sir Urchin with other objects, until he grows bored and suddenly gives a dramatic soliloquy about Sir Urchin's catchphrase: ""Why, you!"" The audience is surprised, and when Sir Urchin gets angry at him for not saying the right lines, Snail Fail declares that he wants to be a more serious actor, and quits his spot on the show.SpongeBob and Patrick decide to get the two back together. SpongeBob rides his unicycle to Snail Fail's house, while Patrick calls a taxi, only for Sir Urchin to be the driver. Patrick tells Sir Urchin that he is a fan of his show and repeatedly hits him with a hammer, giving Sir Urchin the idea to have Patrick be Snail Fail's replacement.Meanwhile, SpongeBob arrives at Snail Fail's house through the mail. He refuses to go back to Sir Urchin's show, so SpongeBob sets him up with a performance of Hamlet at Shady Shoals Rest Home, although the audience reacts negatively.Patrick and Sir Urchin re-enact the show on the street, but between their lack of an audience and Patrick's inability to remember his lines, it does not go over well. Sir Urchin and Snail Fail are both notified of an upcoming talent show, and separately agree to attend.Backstage, they run into each other, where SpongeBob and Patrick try to get them together. Snail Fail wants to perform with SpongeBob, while Sir Urchin is trying to go first with Patrick.

He hits Sir Urchin with the skull he is holding, making the audience laugh again. SpongeBob and Patrick are glad that the show is back, and Sir Urchin and Snail Fail give a personal shout out to them, popping out of the TV screen.

Patrick does not have a bike, but Gary manages to find a spare one in SpongeBob's garage. Patrick tries to ride the bike, but he does not know how to, so SpongeBob agrees to teach him. He uses various methods to help Patrick get on the bike, but Patrick continuously struggles to do so.SpongeBob balances Patrick's brain, and he is able to get on the bike afterwards. SpongeBob helps Patrick pedal, but his hands remain on the bike while he is away from Patrick, resulting in Patrick crashing into SpongeBob's garage. SpongeBob then tries to help Patrick focus by riding ahead of him with a Krabby Patty, but Patrick ends up falling after he eats it.SpongeBob and Patrick are soon shown on a tandem bicycle, with SpongeBob showing Patrick how to pedal. SpongeBob asks Patrick if he can pedal faster, but Patrick pedals so fast that the two ride out of control and crash into Mrs. Puff and Mr. Krabs, as well as Squidward. SpongeBob asks Mrs. Puff for advice on teaching Patrick, but Mrs. Puff tells SpongeBob that some students are unteachable, which unintentionally gives SpongeBob the idea to ""unteach"" Patrick by clearing his brain.SpongeBob clears Patrick's brain of several aspects of his knowledge — such as brushing his teeth, watching TV, putting on his pants, and his family — to make room for bike riding. SpongeBob prepares a bike-riding memory for Patrick. When Patrick is about to ride the bike, SpongeBob tells him to have fun, but this clashes with the bike-riding memory, resulting in Patrick forgetting how to ride a bike. Patrick slides away and ends up riding down Dead Man's Hill, managing to make it to the bottom. Patrick is then shown in several instances of riding throughout Bikini Bottom, helping people in the process. Patrick's favors result in him receiving Ms. Mayor's key to the town.Patrick is later shown in the hospital, where it is revealed that he crashed on Dead Man's Hill and ended up in a six-week coma meaning all the instances were dreams. SpongeBob expresses his regret at not being able to teach Patrick how to reveal a bike, but Patrick reveals that he is a bike himself, and he and SpongeBob ride out of the hospital and crash, with SpongeBob claiming that he doesn't know how to ""ride a Patrick.""",Ride Patrick Ride,,0.21,Luke Brookshier

Plankton tries to take the Krabby Patty, but SpongeBob catches the patty sneaking away. SpongeBob wraps up the patty and puts it in his delivery bag, unaware that Plankton is inside as well. SpongeBob takes various modes of transportation for his delivery, and after 80 minutes, SpongeBob makes it to his destination, revealed to be right next to the Krusty Krab. Just as he makes the delivery, a wind blows SpongeBob away and he ends up on Monster Island.SpongeBob catches the patty sneaking away again and soon realizes that Plankton was inside his delivery bag. SpongeBob, realizing that he and Plankton are stuck on the island together, figures that they should make the patty last by sharing it in order to survive on the island.

Mr. Krabs is at first uninterested in the parade, but SpongeBob says that it can help with free advertising for the Krusty Krab, which convinces him. Mr. Krabs asks SpongeBob and Squidward to build a float, with Squidward as the designer and SpongeBob as the constructor.The following morning, SpongeBob shows Squidward the finished float, consisting of several Krabby Patties and a giant secret formula bottle, with Squidward's drawing included on one. Sure enough, Plankton is shown spying on SpongeBob and Squidward's conversation, in which he hears that SpongeBob wrote the actual secret formula ingredients on the paper inside the bottle. Plankton decides to enter the parade as a result so he can steal the formula from the float.Perch Perkins and the Ice Cream King commentate on the parade, with the Bikini Bottom High School marching band the first to be introduced. While Plankton observes the parade, the Krusty Krew prepare their float to enter, as the other floats are presented, including Larry's Gym, Mrs. Puff as her balloon, Patrick's rock, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's invisible boatmobile, and Fred's ""My leg"" vehicle. The Krusty Krab float is the last to drive downtown.Plankton, continuing to observe the parade, has finished his float, and drives towards the parade. He drives into the Krusty Krab float, resulting in SpongeBob losing control of the fryers and Squidward getting thrown off the wheel. The Krusty Krab float drives out of control, causing a chain reaction of the other floats crashing into each other. Plankton drives crazily towards the Krusty Krab float, the only one still standing, for the secret formula. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob leave the float, and Plankton's float collides with the Krusty Krab's.After the collision, Squidward reveals Plankton was chasing them because SpongeBob wrote down the actual secret formula for the bottle prop, which shocks Mr. Krabs. The giant secret formula bottle lands at Plankton's float, with him about to read the paper. Soon after, a gas station float enters the parade and it explodes upon contact from a lit match. The explosion results in the secret formula's bottle being ripped apart. Plankton gets one ingredient of the formula, shown to be salt, and thinks that he can obtain the formula by adding in other ingredients.

Krabs is skeptical, but SpongeBob then cries at Plankton leaving and says that he will miss him. Plankton and Karen close the truck and drive off, and the Chum Bucket is promptly demolished.Mr. Krabs, now realizing that he no longer has to worry about his formula being stolen, dances and gloats. Soon, construction workers drop a flower shop on top of the empty Chum Bucket lot. Not wanting to get into another feud, Mr. Krabs decides to start on the right foot with the store's owner. He steps inside and is greeted by a kindly woman named Petunia. She is already familiar with the Krusty Krab, since it is her favorite restaurant, and tells him to stop by anytime.After Krabs leaves, it is revealed that Petunia is actually Plankton piloting a robot, planning to steal the secret formula. Just then, SpongeBob comes in and enthusiastically smells the flowers. He wants to buy a sunflower, which is actually Karen in disguise, and Petunia guides him away. Squidward enters, annoyed by SpongeBob not being at work, to fill customers' orders. SpongeBob leaves, and Squidward immediately falls in love with Petunia. Petunia gives him a complimentary begonia, but a jellybee comes out of it and stings Squidward's nose, making his face swell up and causing him to run out of the flower shop in horror.After working in the shop for longer, Karen realizes that nobody is suspicious of Plankton yet. Plankton, however, has gotten used to his disguise and enthusiastically heads out to deliver flowers, spreading cheer to people around town. Back at the shop, Petunia sells many bouquets, including one to Squidward. Krabs comes in to get Squidward back to work, and Petunia shows him a giant bag of flowers he ordered. Krabs and SpongeBob carry the flowers back to the Krusty Krab.Karen tells Plankton that their plan is nearing completion. However, Plankton is losing interest in the formula, wanting to become a full-time florist instead. Annoyed, Karen reminds him that he sold explosive flowers to the Krusty Krab to steal the formula. Plankton uses his Petunia disguise and runs into the Krusty Krab, taking everyone's flowers before they can explode. Krabs whispers to Squidward that he thinks something is wrong with Petunia, but this inspires him to profess his love to her and Squidward could not keep putting it off.Petunia is carrying the explosive flowers back to the flower shop. Squidward interrupts her, offering her a begonia from his own garden and proposing to her. Just then, the bouquet explodes, and Plankton's disguise is exposed; an embarrassed Squidward goes off and buries himself. A furious Krabs leads his customers to step on Plankton, but he is rescued by SpongeBob, who is relieved to have Plankton back.

Mrs. Puff comes out and tells the audience that she will help student drivers learn the rules to earn their license.Lesson #1: ""The Five-Point Pre-Check."" Squidward demonstrates checking his boat before driving: checking the tire buoyancy, ensures the propeller is oiled, confirms the horn works, tests his signals, and fastens his seatbelt. SpongeBob is used to demonstrate improper driving: he over-inflates his tires, dumps too much oil on the propeller and splashes it on Squidward, honks the horn too hard, and spins his signals fast enough that the boat takes flight. While putting his seatbelt on, he wraps it around the entire boat. Its tires pop and it falls onto Squidward's boat. SpongeBob asks if he can get his license now, and Mrs. Puff says no.Lesson #2: ""Entering Traffic."" Squidward, still injured, inches forward and waits for traffic to clear up. When the roads are clear, he looks both ways and moves forward slightly. SpongeBob comes from the side and rams into him, sending Squidward's boat flying into a billboard. SpongeBob asks for his license again, and Mrs. Puff says no.Lesson #3: ""Spotting Pedestrians."" Squidward watches out for pedestrians: he swerves around an old lady and a baby. When he is about to run into a fruit cart, he lifts his boat up to evade it. He then spots two workers carrying a pane of glass, but runs off two boards and a truck as a ramp to go over them. SpongeBob suddenly jumps into his way, bouncing on a pogo stick. Squidward almost runs into the old lady again, but she reveals her muscles and destroys his car, throwing it into a garbage truck. SpongeBob bounces into the camera, asking for his license.Due to a missing reel, the video skips ahead to Lesson #29: ""Navigation."" Squidward, now heavily bandaged and with his boat damaged, first runs over some speed bumps. Next, he sees children crossing, but they are so slow that he drives around them. Overwhelmed by directions, Squidward checks his map and goes into the freeway -- only for Mrs. Puff to narrate that reading a map while driving is bad driving etiquette, to his embarrassment. SpongeBob shows up driving the wrong way, skidding against Squidward's boat and sending him out of control. Squidward's boat goes off an unfinished bridge and explodes.The reel skips ahead to Lesson #53: ""Proper Passenger Etiquette."" An even more injured Squidward is driving with SpongeBob as his passenger. SpongeBob tells Squidward that he will earn his license, jumping on the dashboard and blocking his vision. Squidward pushes him away. When Mrs. Puff tells him not to be a ""backseat driver,"" he grabs hold of Squidward's brace and makes him drive out-of-control. Next, SpongeBob turns up the music too loud, then sets the AC too cold and too hot. He sets the car in reverse, almost crashing into the children until Squidward takes control again. Squidward shoves SpongeBob in the glove compartment.Lesson #54: ""Road Rage."" Patrick passes Squidward, making him angry and leading him to speed up. Mrs. Puff narrates an acronym, ""RAGE: Relax And Go Elsewhere."" SpongeBob comes out of the glove compartment and helps Squidward relax through deep breathing, drinking tea, and raking a small Zen garden. Just after Squidward is finally relaxed, it turns out that the car is completely stopped and there is a long line of traffic behind them. Squidward tries to start the car, but it sputters instead. A large trucker steps out and grabs Squidward. Before he can punch him, the film itself burns up and disintegrates.The episode switches format, with only the character's silhouettes being seen against the projector. SpongeBob tries to fix it, but gets caught in it himself. Mrs. Puff tells him to get out, and says that they cannot finish the film, walking off as the class cheers. SpongeBob still wants to finish class and get his license, so he tries to make the video himself.SpongeBob's ""film"" opens with a crudely-drawn prop of his driver's license. SpongeBob narrates that he was such a good driver that he got a ceremony in his honor. He then brings peace to the world by delivering Krabby Patties, catching criminals, and preventing the ice caps from melting. In the final shot, cutouts of Mrs. Puff and Squidward start kissing him.Mrs. Puff snaps and turns the lights on, revealing SpongeBob making the video himself using paper cut-outs in front of the projector screen. She dismisses the students, then throws SpongeBob's cut-outs into the fireplace. The students drive their desks out of class, but Mrs. Puff grabs SpongeBob and takes him back in. She confiscates his paper license, tears it up, then kicks him out of class and slams the door.",Yellow Pavement,,0.21,Danny Giovannini

Confident that she can still take care of Spot, Karen analyzes him with a laser beam, but Spot chases after it.

In the meantime, Mr. Krabs has transferred Squidward to the circus, and SpongeBob to the The Salty Spitoon. SpongeBob is frightened by the place and its tough, scary regulars, and is hesitant to go in. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob that he just has to look tough, and confront the strongest patron. After going inside, SpongeBob bumps into a large shark. He gets the shark's attention and compliments his blue eyes, which indirectly starts a brawl between another whale patron with green eyes. SpongeBob is pulled out of the battle by an anglerfish, who is the boss of the place, and she takes him to the kitchen.The grill repeatedly shoots flames, and SpongeBob's ""spatula"" is a rusty trowel. He questions what happened to the last fry cook, and is shown an Employee of the Month wall, all of whom have been killed. The boss demands that he cook a ""brick covered in nails, with extra motor oil."" Misinterpreting it as diner slang, SpongeBob serves up a sandwich. The boss rejects it, and SpongeBob cooks the correct dish. The first customer who eats it likes it, and SpongeBob eagerly prepares more.Suddenly, Mrs. Puff (as ""Puff the Tuff"") shows up, wearing a wig and spiked jacket. When she sees SpongeBob serving at the grill, she runs out screaming. The shark gets suspicious and asks why Mrs. Puff is afraid of him. Mo and the boss test SpongeBob with some ""Trials of Toughness.""The first test is riding a mechanical bull. SpongeBob, thinking that the bull needs a break from people riding it, goes under it and accidentally launches it out of the building. Next, they use a cinder block as a punching bag. SpongeBob misses his aim and knocks over another customer's plate, sending his fork flying and landing in the head of another patron, who compliments his punch. In a ""body hair strength"" competition, SpongeBob uses his abrasive side and carves a piece of wood into a sculpture of his opponent. SpongeBob is declared the toughest guy in the Spitoon, and is given full power to do whatever he wants to the place.After a day, the Salty Spitoon is renovated into the ""Softy Spitoon."" The interior is cute, girly and pink, and all the customers enjoy tea parties, arts, and crafts. A tough new group of bikers show up, surprised at the place being called the toughest in town, and demand to speak to the owner. SpongeBob approaches him, and rather sings a song with the customers about how wholesome the place is. The head biker calls them ""weenies,"" only to be offered food by the shark patron. He rejects the food and makes him cry. The whale defends the shark and threatens the biker, leading to another brawl.Mr. Krabs arrives, only to walk in on the large-scale fight. The anglerfish boss compliments SpongeBob, who is able to do his job and serve the customers while everyone is fighting. The boss wants to keep him, but Krabs demands to have him back. They get into a fight, and SpongeBob saves Mr. Krabs, saying that the place might be too dangerous for him. He gives Krabs a piggyback ride out of the restaurant, as the Softy Spitoon customers chase after him. A pan back to the restaurant's kitchen shows the Employee of the Month wall, with a photo of a smiling SpongeBob captioned ""Employee of da Year"" that is surrounded by childlike drawings.",Salty Sponge,,0.27,Doug Lawrence

Squidward screams and flushes SpongeBob back down. When SpongeBob arrives home, he sees Gary stuck in the walls of the house. To get into the walls, SpongeBob opens the door on a picture of his parents' house and goes inside. The door closes, leaving him trapped behind the walls.Inside the walls, SpongeBob sees Gary's shadow. A crazed, bearded old man snarls at him, scaring him. However, Gary is safe, and the man gives him a treat. He introduces himself as Wally C., a man who has lived inside the walls for years. He tells SpongeBob that he used to be a handyman, but when two other workers wallpapered the house, they trapped him inside. This happened to be the same house that SpongeBob ended up buying. SpongeBob suggests that he and Wally look for a way out, but Wally tells him there is no escape. He has become accustomed to living there, and offers to give SpongeBob and Gary a tour of ""Wallhalla.""Wally shows SpongeBob and Gary his mold garden, which is under attack by sea urchins. SpongeBob picks up some urchin droppings, which he mistakes for raisins. Next, Wally shows him the ""magic fridge,"" which is the backside of SpongeBob's. SpongeBob tastes some kelp juice, unaware that it is actually from his own fridge. Wally takes SpongeBob to the ""magic medicine cabinet,"" taking out SpongeBob's toothbrush and using it to clean his nose.SpongeBob admires how easy life in Wallhalla must be, but Wally informs him of one problem: a neighbor who walks around with squeaky shoes, shrieks with delight at any time, and has a loud and annoying laugh, which ended up driving him mad. Wally is unaware that this describes SpongeBob, so the two have a ""friendship feast"" together, eating mushrooms and drinking kelp juice. SpongeBob thanks Wally, but says he and Gary are going to look for a way back home. Wally doesn't know who Gary is, and claims that Gary is his pet, based on the writing on Gary's shell. However, he pronounces it as ""ga-RY."" SpongeBob laughs at this mix-up, and the laugh makes Wally realize who he really is. Wally lashes out at him in rage, chasing him down while knocking over pipes and boards that reinforce the walls.Patrick enters the house, where SpongeBob and Wally are chasing each other throughout the walls. Patrick eats from the fridge and watches TV, which SpongeBob and Wally enter, but he ignores them. A package arrives with cookies from SpongeBob's mother. Patrick ""returns"" it by flushing it down the toilet, breaking the packaging and eating the cookies inside. SpongeBob and Wally break through the medicine cabinet, and Wally cries that Wallhalla has been destroyed. SpongeBob comforts him by asking if there was anything he missed from the outside world, and Patrick unwraps a fresh Krabby Patty. Wally admits that he has been rationing an old, moldy Krabby Patty for decades.At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob prepares a giant Krabby Patty. He gives it to Wally, whose hand is sticking out from the floorboards. Wally then travels into the cash register, asking Squidward for mustard. Horrified, Squidward runs out of the restaurant screaming as SpongeBob and Wally laugh, only for Wally to stop and comment that he still hates SpongeBob's laugh.",Wallhalla,,0.32,Danny Giovannini

They begin building the yacht and SpongeBob makes the yacht's mast, floating, but it falls onto Squidward pushing him into the ground. Squidward tells SpongeBob that he should start with the frame and SpongeBob pulls him out with a large hammer.

SpongeBob tickles the wooden plank, making it laugh, then bend up. Squidward regrets that, but gets smacked again by the wooden plank.

A zoom-in into the portrait leads into the episode, which starts with Mr. Krabs locking up the Krusty Krab. While leaving the restaurant, he notices a quarter rolling down the street and chases after that. After Mr. Krabs stops for breath, the quarter suddenly stops rolling. Mr. Krabs gets a glass of water and splashes it into his face. He gives a signal for the quarter to continue rolling, leading him into a store. Passing through the store, the quarter bounces off a loose floorboard and lands inside a payphone. Mr. Krabs shakes the payphone to try to get the quarter out, while an old Klopnodian man calls him from behind. Mr. Krabs asks the man for his quarter, to which he says that he can have the payphone. However, the man warns Mr. Krabs of a curse inside the payphone.The next morning at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs installs the payphone and informs the customers that they can use it at the cost of a quarter. Mr. Krabs gets a call from the payphone, to which a voice tells him to give away Krabby Patties for free. Mr. Krabs questions the voice inside, but the phone suddenly attaches to his eyes and hypnotizes him into saying the Krabby Patties are free. SpongeBob takes notice of these words and throws the patties towards the customers. The phone detaches from Mr. Krabs, causing him to get out of his hypnotized state. A quarter comes out of the payphone and Mr. Krabs quickly realizes SpongeBob is giving away free patties. Mr. Krabs takes away all of the patties and forces SpongeBob to get back into the kitchen.Mr. Krabs receives another call from the payphone, to which he is then hypnotized into giving away all of his money. He goes into his office and gives his money to his customers. SpongeBob questions Mr. Krabs' actions at first, but thinks he still has his generous side and grabs the register. The phone detaches from Mr. Krabs' eyes and Mr. Krabs is de-hypnotized again as he gets another quarter. He notices SpongeBob giving money out and grabs the register from him.

Mr. Krabs is then hypnotized into giving away the Krusty Krab.Plankton is seen outside of the restaurant, preparing a laser cannon. Mr. Krabs, in his hypnotized state, gives the Krusty Krab deed to Plankton. Plankton questions the action at first, but still celebrates his win. Meanwhile, a bolt falls out of the laser cannon, causing the machine to hit Plankton. Mr. Krabs is de-hypnotized again, but a quarter does not come out of the phone this time. The voice inside the phone laughs as Mr. Krabs uses a crowbar to unlock the coin slot.Mr. Krabs notices a demon inside the phone, revealed to have been using a commutator to hypnotize Mr. Krabs.

However, he soon notices shaking, which is revealed to be coming from Squidward smashing the payphone with a mallet, while Plankton now owns the Krusty Krab. Plankton tells Squidward to get rid of the payphone. Squidward throws the payphone into the dumpster, with Mr. Krabs still inside.The scene cuts to the French Narrator in the center of a wormhole, with him saying ""a free phone sometimes comes at a very high price"" and ""cheapskates sometimes get stuck with the bill.""

The scene cuts to a robotic version of SpongeBob's pineapple, where a holographic mailman delivers mail. We see a robot version of SpongeBob, named SpongeBot, wake up and go through his daily routine: unplugging himself from his bed, assembling his body and face in the bathroom, then eating nuts, bolts, and grease for breakfast. RoboGary enters, and SpongeBot uses a laser pointer from his nose to play with him. SpongeBot's alarm alerts him that it's time to work, but RoboGary wants to keep playing. SpongeBot says goodbye to Gary and equips his Krusty Krab hat, which is a many-legged robot. As he adjusts the hat into position, RoboGary opens up SpongeBot's back and hides inside of him. Unaware, SpongeBot leaves the house.SpongeBot first stops by SquidBot at his house, who is assembling a clone of himself. Annoyed, SquidBot kicks him away, and finishes the clone, who self-destructs after realizing he has to live next to SpongeBot. Next, SpongeBot greets Pat-Tron at his house, who wants to come to work with him, but powers down. A hologram explains that he is recharging, and SpongeBot promises to bring him fuel from work. RoboGary peeks out of SpongeBot's back as he turns around, poking Pat-Tron's body.SpongeBot arrives late to work, where SquidBot is waiting. SpongeBot uses a key in his finger to open The Krabby Battery, pressing a button that makes a giant hand drop a large battery into a receptacle. This forms the basis of the restaurant. Inside, Mr. Krabs is a robot on a track, who is malfunctioning and repeatedly saying, ""You're fired!"" SpongeBot hits him with a large wrench to fix him. SquidBot comments that he wishes he was fired, much to SpongeBot's horror, and RoboKrabs orders them both back to work.SpongeBot begins by cooking ""Krabby Batteries,"" frying them on the grill and cutting up small batteries as condiments. RoboGary, still inside SpongeBot's body, leans out to taste some, but electrocutes himself. SquidBot leans his head into the kitchen to relay an order, and Gary crashes into him, fusing them together. To SpongeBot's horror, Gary runs out of the restaurant with SquidBot stuck upside-down to his shell. Gary briefly stops to do his business (expelling a small amount of nuts and bolts, which SpongeBot cleans up), then runs into the Grease Bucket. PlankBot, a wind-up toy version of Plankton, sees them causing chaos. He attempts to chase after them, but winds down. A fish version of Karen winds him back up, and SpongeBot stops by to ask her which way Gary went.Still with SquidBot on his body, Gary runs into the street, causing a traffic collision. The angry citizens chase after him and SpongeBot. Gary also passes through the house of Sandroid, a large robot head that resembles Sandy, triggering her to wake up. Sandroid flies off to attack him, and SpongeBot follows them. PlankTron follows behind, but is run over by robot citizens, and Karen sets him back upright.At Lube Lagoon, robots are seen sun tanning, playing volleyball, and selling hot dogs. Suddenly, GrandPat appears from the time closet, only to read the Lube Lagoon sign and realize he is not where he expected. Seeing a swarm of angry robots, he retreats back into the closet. Meanwhile, the robots (including Sandroid) chase Gary to the lagoon, and SpongeBot thinks of a plan to stop them. He comes up with the idea to build a brick wall, uses a rocket to reach the shore, and quickly builds the entire wall. He tells Gary to stop before he crashes, but Gary proceeds to crash through the wall, followed by the robot citizens and Sandroid. Gary is now detached from SquidBot, and runs off happily chasing a flutterbot (a robot butterfly).However, the rest of the robots are stuck in the lagoon, as Sandroid approaches from below. She pulls them all under the water, and after a surge of electricity, combines them all into one large body. Sandroid launches plugs out of her mouth to capture the rest of the robots on the beach, reinforcing her body. She surfaces and begins riding Bikini Atoll, revving up one of the trees like a motor and jet-skiing away. She announces a ""rise of the robots,"" which PlankTron (who is stuck on her finger) supports. The French Narrator appears and says that, while the viewer may believe robots will never replace humans, ""anything can happen in a cartoon."" He begins stuttering and glitching in a robotic manner as Sandroid heads towards a real-life city skyline in the distance.",Welcome to Binary Bottom,,0.31,Doug Lawrence

While Squidward imagines himself at a resort, he notices the trip includes his family, which SpongeBob and Patrick have registered themselves as.SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are seen waiting in line at Bikini Bottom Airport. When called up, Squidward shows his ticket, and he is announced as the contest winner. The three then get their ""family"" picture taken. While on the plane, Squidward is assigned to sit between SpongeBob and Patrick, to which he tries to move to the aisle seat, but is forced back to his assigned seat by the flight attendant. The plane soon takes off after SpongeBob and Patrick overly strap their seatbelts on. They switch seats just before the plane gains altitude, much to Squidward’s annoyance.SpongeBob and Patrick run down the plane aisle, before eventually falling asleep, but Squidward, still awake, begins to cry. Patrick ends up needing to use the bathroom later on. Trying to find one, he opens a door that sends two flight attendants falling out of the plane. Squidward, still tangled to his seatbelt, tries to get the flight attendants' help, but he only gets Patrick, who now is a flight attendant. Patrick forcefully pours coffee into Squidward's mouth.

SpongeBob, who was doing some spring cleaning, says that Squidward should deliver the letter to Nosferatu, since he considers it a federal crime to throw other people's mail away. Squidward agrees to deliver the mail, and SpongeBob tags along. Squidward opens his closet to reveal that he has years' worth of Nosferatu's mail mistakenly delivered to him.SpongeBob and Squidward travel on their way to Nosferatu's castle.

Mr. Krabs notices that Squidward is happy, and Squidward shares that he erased SpongeBob's memories of him.

As a result, Mr. Krabs forces SpongeBob and Squidward to spend time with each other to relive the two's interactions and get his memory back, so he remembers the combination.Squidward takes SpongeBob around town to relive SpongeBob's former memories of him, but they all prove to be unsuccessful at first. Squidward's last resort to get SpongeBob to remember him is going on the Sushi-Maker, combined with some other memories, which ultimately causes SpongeBob to remember him, and the combination to the Krusty Krab safe as a result.

The other customers go up to Plankton as he runs out of the restaurant in discomfort soon afterwards. At the Chum Bucket, Plankton complains to Karen about everyone finding him adorable when he wants to be seen as evil, which gives him the idea to build a robot, Q.T.-π, that will eat anyone who says ""aww!"" However, Plankton ends up being the first one eaten after groaning in response to being told to take out the trash.SpongeBob heads to the Krusty Krab, with Q.T.-π following him. SpongeBob notices Q.T.-π, but he finishes his sentence as ""cute little robot like you shouldn't be out here all alone!"", so it does not eat him, and he takes it inside the restaurant, introducing it to the customers and Squidward. SpongeBob asks Squidward to watch over Q.T.-π. Squidward compliments Q.T.-π, saying it is cute. Other customers show up around Squidward, but he forces them away. Squidward and the customers say ""aww!,"" resulting in Q.T.-π eating all of them. Mr. Krabs comes out of his office and gets eaten as well. SpongeBob comes out of the bathroom and notices that everyone is gone, thinking that the restaurant closed early.Mr. Krabs notices that he and the Bikini Bottomites are all in a prison inside Q.T.-π. Plankton tries to dodge the blame, but Mr. Krabs immediately notices that he was at fault. Angered, Mr. Krabs asks Plankton how to get out of the robot, to which Plankton replies that they have to escape through the emergency evacuation uvula. The Bikini Bottomites form a pyramid in an attempt to get Plankton towards the uvula, but are unsuccessful.SpongeBob takes Q.T.-π to the veterinarian. The veterinarian takes a look at Q.T.-π, hearing noise inside it. She asks Q.T.-π to say ""aww!,"" resulting in it transforming and eating the veterinarian.

He lands in the prison, thinking everyone is there for a surprise party, but Mr. Krabs explains to him that he can be used to help everyone reach the escape uvula. The Bikini Bottomites form a pyramid that SpongeBob climbs up towards the uvula. Plankton lifts up the pyramid, allowing SpongeBob to reach the uvula.They all escape and land inside Glove World!. While everyone goes for the rides, SpongeBob comforts Q.T.-π, having been left alone. He gets the idea to use it for a ride, with its mechanism of eating people used for the entertainment.

SpongeBob bemoans that he can't leave the Krusty Krab, so Pearl volunteers while Nobby takes her place. Pearl then takes Mr. Krabs' credit card so they can start their trip.Pearl and Narlene soon arrive in the big city, where Narlene collects all the gum that's been left on the pavement. The two wander around and take in the sights, like the skyscrapers and public transport. Back at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob stresses over the fact he can't reach the fryer from the grill, so Nobby starts moving all the various machines closer to SpongeBob.Eventually, Pearl and Narlene end up at the heart of the big city; Upturn's, a large skyscraper-like department store. Narlene is fascinated by the automatic sliding door and accidentally rips it off, drawing the ire of Upturn's owner, Lady Upturn. Narlene flattens Upturn with the door, and Pearl apologizes for Narlene's behavior, before showing her their credit card. Lady Upturn forgives them, but warns them that at Upturn's, they take shopping seriously.The two soon arrive at the perfume department, where Narlene is put off by the fancy smells. After the manager sprays perfume in her face, she uses her own toadstool tang perfume, which causes a huge stink that drives everyone out. Pearl and Narlene then try some clothes, before going to a sale at the shoe department. Narlene's dislike of shoes makes her destroy a stiletto, causing the manager to realize the two are the wanted ruffians, before calling security.Pearl and Narlene try to escape, but the security guards surround them as Lady Upturn arrives. Pearl tries to apologize, but Lady Upturn ignores her, stating that the two will never shop at Upturn's again. They escape to the store's roof, where Lady Upturn comments that country visitors like Narlene is especially unwelcome. This makes Pearl stick up for Narlene, calling Lady Upturn a snob, before trying to use Narlene's gum to let them escape. The guards stop them, but Pearl throws their credit card off the building, causing the guards and Lady Upturn to jump after it.The two make it back to the Krusty Krab, where Nobby is causing chaos. Narlene whistles for him to stop, before thanking Pearl for the day out, and hopes to take her to the countryside as thanks. Mr. Krabs then complains about the credit card bill from their day out, causing Pearl to decide to go to the country right then.

Bertie passes her driver's test and Mrs. Puff gives her a license. Bertie compliments her teaching skills, but SpongeBob soon shows up menacingly.

SpongeBob hopes Bubble Bass will enjoy his lunch, but takes away his fries and soda after he notices they are not perfect. SpongeBob then takes away a Krabby Patty and Bubble Bass chases him through the restaurant while SpongeBob continues noticing issues with his meal. Bubble Bass grabs the Krabby Patty off SpongeBob and eats it, but SpongeBob goes inside of him and gets the patty back after coming out of Bubble Bass's belly button. Bubble Bass runs out of the restaurant as the flashback ends.Plankton grabs a sponge to tell his story next. A flashback at the Chum Bucket is shown.

At that moment, Squidward opens his front door, to which no one is seen. However, SpongeBob shows up inside his house, asking for salt water. He greets everyone inside the house and learns of the club, but is unaware of the fact it's a vendetta against him and compliments on all the members. Patrick is also seen inside, drinking punch from a bowl. SpongeBob agrees to make pineapple punch using the walls of his house. As he comes back, he trips over Squidward, indirectly causing a fire inside his house. Everyone runs out, except SpongeBob and Squidward.

He notices a substance that he thinks is goo show up underneath Mr. Krabs when he walks in and he sprays him with water. SpongeBob notices more of that substance outside the Krusty Krab and uses soap to clean it up. One of the soap bubbles mixes with a solution Plankton is making, and it creates an explosion. Plankton thinks the substance on the ground is oil and tries to use it for money. Mr. Krabs and Plankton fight over it, before Karen tells them that the combination of Krabby Patty grease and chum runoff resulted in grease being leaked into the ground for decades. She tells them that the grease's viscosity index and flavoring can be used for a profit, though it's evenly split between the restaurants in which Mr. Krabs and Plankton agree to work as partners.After several days, Mr. Krabs and Plankton fight over how they can use the grease, before SpongeBob tells them that he uses the grease in many different ways and tells them that they can sell it for everything. Mr. Krabs and Plankton form a business selling Dr. Krabton's Miracle Everything Juice, to sell the grease for any way that they can use it. Several Bikini Bottomites drive towards the stand and crash into each other, to which Mr. Krabs and Plankton start to sell Everything Juice, using it for calming babies, gluing hair back to heads and fixing a boat. Mr. Krabs and Plankton quickly gain a fortune as a result.Mr. Krabs heads to sell some Everything Juice to Mrs. Puff at Boating School, with SpongeBob's assistance. SpongeBob uses it to fuel her boats and clean her lighthouse, as well as smoothing out his face. Mrs. Puff agrees to purchase ten bottles. Plankton heads to sell some Everything Juice to Sandy at her treedome. Plankton advertises the product by saying it can fertilize lawns, polish the treedome glass, and shine nuts. Sandy claims to not believe in miracles at first, but after Plankton claims that Everything Juice can also keep Sandy's oxygen machine running, she agrees to buy a case.To further endorse Everything Juice, Mr. Krabs and Plankton perform a song to the Bikini Bottomites, showing them the other uses that Everything Juice has. Mr. Krabs and Plankton manage to successfully sell it to the Bikini Bottomites. In an office building, Mr. Krabs and Plankton discuss their fortune and friendship, and have a money fight, but the Bikini Bottomites angrily barge in, showing the side-effects that resulted, such as affecting Sandy's air and giving Mrs. Puff pinkeye. They demand for refunds and destroy the office building, as Mr. Krabs and Plankton argue over who is at fault.Outside the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob tries to obtain more grease from a machine, but it is all out. Mr. Krabs and Plankton meanwhile still argue over who is at fault for the side-effects. They address to each other that their friendship is over as they both head back to their restaurants. Right as they do, both the Krusty Krab and the Chum Bucket sink underground, as a result of them using all of their grease from their respective restaurants.

As this happens, SpongeBob, driving with Mrs. Puff, crashes a boat into the nursery. Not being able to see his surroundings, SpongeBob almost drives into the fish while doing this, but the baby saves them and carries them out of the nursery. SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff drive into multiple buildings, until their boat drives into the ribbon of the opening of the Dynamite Factory. They are launched into the air and then crash into Mrs. Puff's house. After SpongeBob leaves, Mrs. Puff, now in bed, questions if he is unteachable, but immediately urges herself to seek guidance.Mrs. Puff calls a guru to alert him of the trouble that SpongeBob is causing her. He recommends Mrs. Puff to figure out how she can be with SpongeBob, without actually being in his presence. At Boating School, she questions how she can follow the guru's advice, as music plays from a submarine above her. She disguises herself using a mask, and jumps onto the window of the submarine, which is boarded by the French Narrator. Mrs. Puff notices that the French Narrator is cutting potatoes, and uses a glass cutter to sneak in. She steals one and leaves through the hole she created in the window, flooding the submarine.At Boating School, Mrs. Puff puts the potato in a boat and disguises it as her, using lipstick and her hair. She attaches a walkie-talkie to the potato as SpongeBob approaches, then hides in the lighthouse. SpongeBob, unaware of the situation, assumes the potato is Mrs. Puff, as the real Puff speaks through the walkie-talkie. SpongeBob proceeds to drive on the test course, and circles a roundabout repeatedly. As Mrs. Puff is watching a soap opera, Headlocks & Heartbreaks, on her TV, SpongeBob drives off the boating course and onto a highway, which is in the direction of downtown Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob proceeds to drive the boat through a playground and the Bikini Bottom Jail while attempting to follow Mrs. Puff's instructions.Mrs. Puff chokes on popcorn while using her walkie-talkie, and SpongeBob's walkie-talkie is bumped, resulting in the signal switching to the one used for alerts about traffic violations. SpongeBob sees a child drive past a stop sign and sets off his siren, and chases him downtown while the bikers from earlier are on his tail. While on his chase, SpongeBob takes a detour; the kid and the bikers are unable to make the turn, and end up driving into the Dynamite Factory (which explodes on impact). A Bikini Bottom News Flash interrupts Headlocks & Heartbreaks, alerting Mrs. Puff about SpongeBob's reckless driving. Mrs. Puff looks out her window, and realizes that Bikini Bottom is in a state of disaster. She attempts to get SpongeBob's attention through her walkie-talkie, but is unable to, so she sets off her lighthouse cannon and blasts herself towards downtown.Mrs. Puff takes control of a fish's motorcycle and goes ahead of SpongeBob, urging him to turn around. SpongeBob successfully does this, but soon crashes into the bikers, resulting in Potato Puff being mashed. SpongeBob cries, still assuming that Mrs. Puff is the potato, but the actual Mrs. Puff soon shows up in front of him. SpongeBob is glad that Mrs. Puff is still alive, as she reassures him of her duty. The bikers approach SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff, asking her for an autograph due to her heroics. However, the police soon show up; the bikers bail, while Mrs. Puff is arrested. The episode ends with Mrs. Puff in jail, peeling potatoes next to the disguised one she used earlier in the episode.",Potato Puff,,0.44,Danny Giovannini

While he is putting the presents by the Christmas tree, he accidentally kicks his gift under the sofa without realizing it. Seven months later, while SpongeBob is vacuuming his house, he notices that Santa never got the gift. SpongeBob is upset that the gift is 212 days late and tells Patrick about it. They decide to travel to the North Pole. While they are skipping and hopping, they accidentally step on Plankton. They tell Plankton that they are going to the North Pole. Plankton pitches an idea to go to the North Pole to hack into Santa's computer to put his name on the nice list. He wants to do it so Santa will give him Krabby Patty secret formula. He decides to tag along with SpongeBob and Patrick. They travel in Plankton's vehicle and it seemingly takes a day to get there. They end up at Christmas Land Theme Park. They encounter Santa and discover that it is Patchy the Pirate disguising as Santa.Patchy proceeds to tell them they are not at the North Pole but rather a theme park. Plankton admonishes the duo for getting them lost while they realize their error. The three explain that they are trying to find the North Pole and Patchy gives them a map to the North Pole. They eventually all make it to the North Pole. They see Santa's workshop and travel to it. An elf tells them that Santa is on vacation and Plankton goes to Santa's computer to put his name on the nice list. SpongeBob and Patrick cause chaos across the workshop, resulting in a fight. Santa arrives and sees that someone has made a mess. Santa sees SpongeBob and says, ""You're a menace!"" to him. SpongeBob reveals that all he wanted was to deliver the present to him. Santa is delighted by the gesture, as he reveals not even the elves or reindeer give him a present, to their embarrassment. SpongeBob gives Santa a bottle with a letter inside and Plankton thinks it's the Krabby Patty secret formula, but finds out that it isn't. Santa, SpongeBob, the reindeer, and the elves tell Plankton to read the letter. Plankton begrudgingly reads it and it is revealed that it is merely a thank you note to Santa for bringing joy and presents to all. Santa is touched and thanks SpongeBob.Next Christmas, Mr. Krabs has a Christmas party at the Krusty Krab and he gives Plankton some coal. SpongeBob gives Plankton a photo of them with Patchy from their mission to the North Pole.

It lands on a planet and someone in a spacesuit exits the rocket. It is revealed to be SpongeBob as he plants a flag with a Krabby Patty on it. It turns out that it was just a dream. He then wakes up to hear some noise in his house, so he thinks that he has intruders. He and Gary then go downstairs, and SpongeBob opens the door so Gary can scare away the intruders. It turns out to be SpongeBob's friend from Kamp Koral, Narlene Narwhal, whom he has not seen since he was a kid.SpongeBob and Narlene hug as they look back at a memory of them at camp. Nobby is riding a sea bear as it is chasing SpongeBob and Narlene, who are holding sausages. Back in the present, Narlene sees how much SpongeBob has grown since they were kids. Narlene came to visit SpongeBob because of a promise that she could always come to him if she were ever in Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob is sad that her brother Nobby is not with her, but soon thereafter, he shows up from the kitchen, holding his fridge. Nobby grabs SpongeBob and gives him a hug. Nobby had gotten a lot bigger since they were kids. Nobby is then hungry, so SpongeBob lets him take what he desired from the fridge. He proceeds to devour the entire fridge as SpongeBob reminisces about the memories at camp. Nobby's sea mule shows up and starts to eat a part of SpongeBob's head.The next morning, the sea mule brays on top of SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob wakes up, pets Gary, then goes into the bathroom to get ready for the day. He covers his eyes and shrieks as he sees Narlene in his toilet. Narlene thinks it is a whirlpool bathtub and joyfully spins around in it. SpongeBob tries to hand her a scrub brush; however, she grabs SpongeBob instead. Patrick is outside the bathroom wrapped in a towel waiting to get in. Afterwards, Nobby cooks' pancakes for breakfast and flings copious amounts to SpongeBob, Narlene, and Gary.Narlene, Nobby, and SpongeBob sit on chairs outside of SpongeBob's house. Narlene uses a knife to shave a wood log into a toothpick. She then passes the knife to Nobby, who shaves a wood log into a turkey. SpongeBob is handed the knife and ends up shaving himself into a banjo. He joyfully jumps out of his chair and moves toward Squidward, who runs away screaming.SpongeBob's house is rebuilt out of wood and medal scraps, which Narlene considers to be ""hillified."" SpongeBob is thrilled as Hans changes his outfit and Narlene's cousin WillyBob shows up at the front door. SpongeBob and WillyBob are introduced to each other. WillyBob starts wrestling with Nobby until Narlene shows up and joins the fray. A large band of narwhals storm the house and make sweeping changes. They also set up camp outdoors and extend onto Squidward's property. Squidward has trouble sleeping until he ultimately decides to move out. When he walks outside, Patrick grabs him and starts to square dance.A news report brings breaking news of narwhals ravaging Bikini Bottom. Citizens are warned to lay low to avoid any further complications. The reporter is turned into a hillbilly as the broadcast is cut off. SpongeBob tries to get what he thinks is Narlene's kin to leave. However, Narlene and Nobby reveal WillyBob is their only other relative and come to the realization that they are not even real narwhals, they are actually nearwhals. With SpongeBob's suggestion, they go to Plankton for help. He agrees to contact his family as they had been feuding with the nearwhals for many years. His family swiftly reacts at hearing the word ""nearwhals."" They come out of the phone and storm out of the Chum Bucket ready to drive the nearwhals out of Bikini Bottom. They fight the nearwhals in various locations throughout the town and are successful in their mission.Nobby packs many of SpongeBob's belongings into the wagon. SpongeBob, Narlene, and SpongeBob say their final goodbyes as Narlene promises to visit again soon. Nobby pulls the wagon to Squidward's house, where him and Nobby enter.

The water from SpongeBob's hose sends Plankton falling into a sewer, landing on Bubble Bass's toothbrush after coming out of a faucet. Bubble Bass brushes his teeth, with Plankton still on his brush, before he spits into the sink, resulting in Plankton falling down the drain.Plankton lands at the bottom of the sewer as he attempts to make his way out, but shaking occurs soon after, revealing a sea gator. While Plankton whimpers, a large batch of chum scares the gator away. The chum reveals a group of C.H.U.M. (Collective Hive Under Master), who bow down and proclaim Plankton as their master. The C.H.U.M. leader says that they are created when Plankton flushes chum into the sewer, and the flushed chum mixes with sewer gases. The leader takes Plankton to their village, where he gets the idea of using the C.H.U.M. to help him steal the formula.Plankton trains the C.H.U.M. for infiltrating the Krusty Krab. He asks the C.H.U.M. to batter down doors in their first exercise, function as weaponry in the second, and utilize karate against cardboard cutouts of SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward in the third. Although being harmed in every exercise, Plankton exclaims the C.H.U.M. as ready, before the Mr. Krabs cardboard cutout falls on him.At the Krusty Krab, Plankton faces Mr. Krabs, as the C.H.U.M. army come out of the bathroom stalls. As the C.H.U.M. destroy the bathroom, they form a tank. The tank launches chum at Mr. Krabs, launching him towards the front window of the restaurant. He tries to ask SpongeBob for help, but he is too busy singing and playing with the hose to notice him. Mr. Krabs tries to hide from the C.H.U.M., as Plankton comes towards him on the tank, which soon forms a monster. Mr. Krabs continues trying to avoid them, but is soon caught.As the C.H.U.M. attacks him, Mr. Krabs pledges to give up the formula, but he soon notices SpongeBob and makes a run around the outside of the Krusty Krab. While the C.H.U.M. chases him down, SpongeBob notices a penny, spraying the hose behind him, which sends Plankton and the C.H.U.M. down the sewer. SpongeBob soon notices Mr. Krabs, who praises him for saving him. At the Chum Bucket, Plankton asks to hang out with the C.H.U.M., but they prefer living in the sewer, as they flush themselves down and the episode ends.",C.H.U.M.S,,0.49,Ben Gruber

SpongeBob pulls Squidward away from him and into his house. SpongeBob says that he does not know what to do now that Patrick is back in his worm state. Squidward tells him that taming a worm is not so hard and that he should be giving him tough love. SpongeBob then pleads to him, asking if he could give tough love to Patrick. He tells SpongeBob to beg him, in which he responds to by acting like a dog. Squidward accepts, before telling SpongeBob to play dead.The next scene shows a caged Patrick and Squidward in protective gear. He tries to teach Patrick how to heel, but that fails.

He puts it on him and tells him that whenever he barks, he will ""give him a mild tough-love shock."" When he tries to use it, it only vibrates, much to Squidward's intentions. He assumes it is broken and tries to take it off, only for it to work on him. Squidward takes Patrick out to abandon him again, instead with Patrick caged up. When Squidward returns home, he opens his door and an angry Patrick comes out. This time, it is Patrick taking Squidward out to abandon him.Squidward drags himself home, and tries to open the door. Patrick answers and growls at him. Marvin shows up and tells Squidward that SpongeBob said that he has trained Patrick using tough love. He tells him that it is impossible to train him and he cannot get him to sit - which Patrick does. He says he tried to get him to beg - which Patrick does, too. Then he starts giving him usual (and unusual) dog commands, ending with ""play dead."" Marvin is impressed and calls Squidward a miracle worker. Marvin then gives Squidward a problem worm that is in need of training: Butcher.Patrick turns back to normal as SpongeBob notices. It is revealed that Patrick snapped out of his worm state hours ago and just wanted to make Squidward feel proud of himself.

Bubble Bass notices that SpongeBob and Patrick bought the last Pigulon figure. Patrick rips open the package and uses the figure as a scratcher. Bubble Bass tries to obtain the figure from them, and SpongeBob agrees to give it to him at first, but soon rejects his offer after mentioning that he and Patrick bought it together.While Karen continues narrating, Bubble Bass pushes her out of the scene. He later shows up at SpongeBob's house disguised as a toy inspector in an attempt to take back the Pigulon figure. SpongeBob lets Bubble Bass into his house and opens his hidden vault where he keeps his toys. SpongeBob and Patrick show the toys to Bubble Bass, continually asking him if any of their toys seem dangerous to him. Although several toys harm Bubble Bass, he throws them away, declaring them not to be dangerous. SpongeBob finally shows him the Pigulon figure, but instead gives him the Perilous Percival figure as he went out of order. The fuses on the toy result in Bubble Bass flying out of the house.Bubble Bass goes back to SpongeBob's house, now portraying as a ghost hunter in an attempt to scan the house. He comes across the Pigulon figure, saying it contains spirits inside. He attempts to take the figure, but SpongeBob and Patrick say that they will make the figure vanish in their home. They call out a spell that results in a demon appearing, and Bubble Bass is taken in with him, as the Pigulon figure remains in SpongeBob's home.Bubble Bass goes back again, asking SpongeBob and Patrick straightforward to hand over the figure. He drinks Fizz Bomb Cola to let out a burp on SpongeBob's house, destroying it in the process. SpongeBob and Patrick run to Patrick's house. After Patrick rejects Bubble Bass again, Bubble Bass uses more Fizz Bomb fuel and Volcano Sauce to destroy his house. SpongeBob and Patrick proceed to go inside Squidward's house. Angered, Squidward kicks Bubble Bass out, to which Bubble Bass proceeds to chug Fizz Bomb Cola from a truck and attempt to belch Squidward's house away. However, Squidward's house does not move, to which Squidward declares his house was ""SpongeBob-proofed.""Karen continues to narrate the story, in which Bubble Bass gets the help of his mother. They show up at Squidward's house, to which Bubble Bass gives the Fizz Bomb fuel to his mother, but she says that she does not need it. She inhales a belch which destroys Squidward's house, as well as the water on the surface. Mama Bass tells SpongeBob and Patrick to hand over the figure. SpongeBob gives her the receipt, which makes Mama Bass angry. She inhales another belch which burps away Bubble Bass's clothes, leaving him in his underwear. Bubble Bass cries, but SpongeBob and Patrick give him the Pigulon figure, which is now broken. Karen concludes the narration with Bubble Bass having put the figure on his shelf and Squidward having to rebuild his house himself, mentioning how Squidward's insurance doesn't cover ""Belch Damage"". Squidward, enraged, blames Karen and her story for his house being destroyed. He chases after a now frightened Karen, although she disappears inside the storybook, much to Squidward's confusion, as the episode ends.",The Big Bad Bubble Bass,,0.39,Andrew Goodman

Realizing that it was because of his pet allergy, he discovers that Lady Upturn snuck her pet worm Fifi into the Krusty Krab. He tells her that pets are not allowed, and Mr. Krabs confirms his statement. However, when she says that Krabby Patties are all that Fifi will eat, and that she would gladly pay double for them, Mr. Krabs changes his mind and declares that pets would be allowed to enter the restaurant from then on, much to Squidward's dismay.Mr. Krabs gladly starts making more money than ever he has before. Just then, the health inspector comes in and tells him that he cannot serve both people and pets in the same restaurant, as it is unsanitary. He makes him decide on only one, and Mr. Krabs decides to pick pets, seeing them as more profitable than their owners. He kicks all of the people out, and says that they will still be paying for whatever their pets eat.Due to the new rule established at the Krusty Krab, customers have no choice but to visit the Chum Bucket, upset that they do not have access to the first restaurant mentioned. Suddenly, Larry suggests that everyone should dress up as pets to enter the Krusty Krab and trick Mr. Krabs, and everyone reacts positively to the suggestion. Back at the aforementioned restaurant, Mr. Krabs continues to earn immense amounts of money, to his surprise, some new ""pets"" arrive. Mr. Krabs does not notice anything strange, so he considers them as customers. The real pets and the fake ones do not manage to interact well, so the Krusty Krab turns into chaos. In an attempt to defuse the situation, SpongeBob unmasks the health inspector, who is also in disguise, much to everyone's surprise. With a song, he explains that pets and people deserve to eat side by side, so he decides to make some changes to the rules, which makes everyone happy.As a celebration, customers eat Krabby Patties with their pets, to which the fire marshal (disguised as Incidental 160) reacts by saying that the restaurant is over capacity for fire hazards. Due to that, he shuts down the restaurant and orders customers to leave the restaurant, leaving Mr. Krabs devastated. SpongeBob then tells him that he can make extra charges to him, cheering Mr. Krabs up a bit. The episode ends with an injured and infected Squidward falling down on the floor towards the ground, sneezing for the last time and causing a closing iris to catch his nose.",A Place for Pets,,0.85,Andrew Goodman

To ensure SpongeBob does not come inside with him, Squidward tells him to serve one side of the crowd. SpongeBob is disappointed, as he was looking forward to spending time with Squidward, but goes with it anyway. Then, he proceeds to enter the studio. However, along the way, he encounters a guard who tries to beat him up. He gathers fans to distract him, and finds Patrick's room, only to be beaten up by the same guard.Meanwhile, SpongeBob has already served his entire section, and when he sees Squidward's side of the crowd still starving, he decides to sell patties over there for their sake. Squidward sneaks backstage, and hides in a violin case, only to be mistaken for an actual violin when The Low Tides begin to play on stage. Mr. Krabs tries to put the sign in the back of the stage, but gets caught up in the curtains. SpongeBob realizes that The Low Tides have not received Krabby Patties, so he tries to send them patties, but accidentally causes them to leave the stage. Mr. Krabs shows the wrinkled sign up on the stage, but the way it is folded from Mr. Krabs being tangled causes the crowd to think the Krabby Patties were not good as they start booing. Mr. Krabs does the Peg Leg Waltz to win the crowd back as a result, with SpongeBob and Squidward joining in, the latter scaring away the whole crowd as a result.

SpongeBob delivers two Krabby Patties to Mrs. Puff and Pearl by spitting them out of his eyes. Out of nowhere, the local health inspector appears. He pulls a device and scans the room, declaring the Krusty Krab to be a health hazard. He suspects that someone in the restaurant has a case of the disease known as ""Clam Flu"" and puts the restaurant under quarantine, locking everyone inside.This causes everyone except for SpongeBob to run around, screaming and panicking. Patrick then asks what a quarantine actually is, and SpongeBob replies that it is like a ""mandatory sleepover."" Squidward debunks this, saying that a quarantine is when a group of people are forced to be locked in a room with a sick person, until eventually everyone gets sick. Overhearing everything that has just happened and not wanting to get sick himself, Plankton comes out of a nearby soda cup, saying that he is abandoning ""operation soda-jerk."" He escapes via the restaurant's funnel, but is immediately lasered by a hazmat fish, prompting everyone else to stay inside.Pearl complains, but Mr. Krabs states that back in his navy days, when one of his fellow sailors got sick, they would isolate the ""sicko"" and lock them in the freezer so that the others can enjoy their good health. When Mrs. Puff asks if they let the sicko out of the freezer once he got better, Mr. Krabs hesitates and says that somebody probably let them out eventually, which concerns Mrs. Puff. Mr. Krabs asks if anyone is feeling sick, to which nobody responds, prompting him to use a pair of tongs as a threat. This causes Squidward to freak out and bump into a table, launching a pepper shaker into the air and into SpongeBob's nose, causing him to sneeze. Everyone assumes that SpongeBob has the disease, even though he clearly doesn't.SpongeBob states that he will go into the freezer willingly, despite not feeling sick. He tries to have an emotional speech, but he is cut short when Mr. Krabs slams the door in his face. It is then revealed that SpongeBob is having fun in the freezer, sledding on a mountain of snow and eating ice cream. Everyone is relieved as they think the worst of the quarantine is over. Patrick looks over and notices that SpongeBob has an ice cream cone, making him interested. Patrick pretends to be sick by rubbing relish all over himself. This causes everyone to freak out, and Patrick ends up getting locked in the freezer. SpongeBob and Patrick end up having a snowball fight with chocolate ice cream.Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl are sitting at a table, paranoid if anyone else has the disease. Squidward itches his arm, and Pearl accuses him of having the Clam Flu. Mr. Krabs throws Squidward in the freezer. Mrs. Puff then yawns, making Mr. Krabs freak out, and he locks her in the freezer as well. Pearl remembers that she still had money left over from last time she went to the mall. This makes Mr. Krabs think that the flu has poisoned Pearl's mind, and he locks her in the freezer too. In the freezer, everyone meets inside an igloo, and Squidward finds out that nobody in the freezer is actually sick. Mrs. Puff then deduce that Mr. Krabs is the one with the sickness, causing Pearl to cry. Squidward decides that the only option is to break out of the freezer and lock Mr. Krabs inside. Everyone agrees, except for SpongeBob, who is reluctant at first. Squidward convinces him by explaining that he cannot make Krabby Patties if he is locked in the freezer. And SpongeBob accepts it as he puts his sunglasses on to put the crab on ice.Everyone busts out of the freezer, much to Mr. Krabs' surprise. Patrick tries to attack him, but Krabs shrinks himself down and hides under the grill. SpongeBob chases Mr. Krabs under the grill and tries to convince him to go willingly, but Mr. Krabs refuses and goes down a pipe leading to the grease trap. SpongeBob comes out from under the grill, covered in mold and unaware of what to do. Squidward then says somebody has to go down there and get Mr. Krabs out before he escapes into the sewers and infects the whole town. Patrick lifts up the grill and shoves Squidward through the pipe, not knowing there was a hatch that leads down there, covering him in grease. After seeing Squidward and had sicko germs from Squidward's sneeze, Mr. Krabs escapes the grease trap and runs into the dining room. Pearl gives chase, but Mr. Krabs gets stuck in her blowhole. Pearl sneezes him out, but he loses his shirt in the processes, causing her blowhole to get plugged up. Patrick corners Mr. Krabs, and they begin to fight. During the fight, Mr. Krabs throws Patrick into the broom closet, covering him in dust. Patrick grabs Mr. Krabs with his tongue and throws him to Mrs. Puff, who catches him in a garbage can. She puffs up, causing trash to fall all over her.Later that night after the battlefield, the health inspector returns to the Krusty Krab and goes inside. He says that he made a mistake (it is surprisingly revealed that he had been holding his tracking equipment upside-down when he came by earlier yesterday) meaning nobody actually had Clam Flu. However, he finds out that everyone now has a different disease, and Mr. Krabs has a combination of all five diseases due to the fight they had earlier of a failure plan to send him back to the freezer. The health inspector panics and runs out of the restaurant, yelling that everyone is actually sick and declares an ""Ultra-Mega Quarantine."" A team of Hazmat units lock the Krusty Krab inside of a crate and airlift it over to the Chum Bucket, where it is dropped. Plankton is heard begging the gang to stay away so he does not get sick, only to end up sneezing; revealing that he was the one with Clam Flu the whole time as the episode ends.",Kwarantined Krab,,0.40,Andrew Goodman

He closes the restaurant and goes somewhere by going under a taxi, while SpongeBob follows him to give him a nickel he dropped.It turns out Mr. Krabs has gone outside of Bikini Bottom to The Slop Pail, where he orders chum. SpongeBob sees that Mr. Krabs is eating chum and likes it, but he does not understand why. Mr. Krabs tells a story about how during one of his navy days, he barely made it back to his ship alive only to find it robbed of all their supplies (although in actuality, he had slept through the entire day while his crew ate everything) and was forced to eat chum due to being the only food left, and upon eating it, grew to love it.SpongeBob promises to keep this a secret, and afterwards, the Slop Pail closes as the owner of the restaurant, Sal, wants to become a movie star. This leaves Mr. Krabs with no chum to eat that is not from the Chum Bucket. Back at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob makes several types of chum with different ingredients as he is unable to make the actual chum recipe. However, Mr. Krabs says none of them are right.Mr. Krabs tries to prevent himself from going to the Chum Bucket, but ends up searching for chum there anyway. Karen and Plankton come outside as they heard a noise, and eventually find out about Mr. Krabs' secret. Plankton gets a plan to offer a lifetime supply of chum to Mr. Krabs in exchange for the formula. Mr. Krabs' chum monkey goes for this offer immediately, and Mr. Krabs goes to the vault to find SpongeBob, who sometimes sleeps in there to be comforted with the formula when feel insomniac.When Plankton takes the formula, he uses the Chum Bucket glove to prevent Mr. Krabs from taking his chum. However, he gets out and attacks Plankton, causing the formula to sink into the chum. Plankton decides to swim inside the chum to obtain the formula. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that he should eat all the chum so he can reach the formula first, and he does so. He gets the formula, but gets extremely overweight, loses his decades-long appetite for chum and accidentally eats Plankton. To pass the time, Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Karen watch Sal's latest movie in theaters, as the episode ends.",The Hankering,,1.10,Andrew Goodman

SpongeBob tries to evade this by keeping the foot with the ankle alarm outside the enclosures, but this fails and he gets kicked out of the zoo, with Patrick sneaking into a sea monkey enclosure so he gets kicked out with him.SpongeBob is crying on Patrick's rock, until he gets the idea of building a bubble zoo after creating a snot bubble.

SpongeBob is able to get out before the trailer sinks, and he finds a lucky peanut.At the cabin, Sandy notices that the trailer has disconnected. Pearl is sad about losing her backpack, but Karen says that they can buy a new one. The Gal Pals quickly redecorate the abandoned cabin, and Pearl leaves to call SpongeBob.

Then Mr. Krabs tells Bubble Bass that he will not get any more food until he pays his tab. Bubble Bass tosses a coin, which Mr. Krabs takes. Bubble Bass tries to negotiate another way and invites Mr. Krabs to a friendly game of three deadly challenges of a tabulation game (of castles). SpongeBob is thrilled with the idea, but Mr. Krabs rejects the board game, causing Bubble Bass to run away. Squidward says Bubble Bass is gone because in his own words, they would never see that game geek again. A voice is heard through the drive-thru speaker saying he wants 50 Krabby Patties with extra pickles. This voice is from Bubble Bass, and SpongeBob is about to give him the Krabby Patties, but Mr. Krabs finds out. Bubble Bass provokes Mr. Krabs by dancing at the drive-thru window until a car honks at him. Mr. Krabs sends Squidward and SpongeBob to Bubble Bass's house to collect his tab.Squidward opens a door to Bubble Bass's house, which SpongeBob is surprised by and praises by saying that he is very strong. SpongeBob and Squidward decide to look for Bubble Bass, but they cannot find him, so they decide to sell the furniture in the house. Bubble Bass tells them to stop destroying his mother's furniture, and they can work it out in the basement. Bubble Bass tells them that if they want him to pay, they need to play the 3 deadly challenges. SpongeBob looks for the game and, upon finding it, tells Bubble Bass that they will play his game. The two enter through the hatch and realize that there is a real version of the 3 Deadly Challenges (made of boxes). The first challenge begins: they both attack Bubble Bass and try to tap him out. Squidward tries to land a blow and hits Bubble Bass, but his belly blocks the attack. The boxes collapse and SpongeBob and Squidward fall, decapitating Bubble Bass, revealing that the Bubble Bass that Squidward tried to attack was not the real Bubble Bass, but a doll (made with Bubble Bass' mom's sofa cushions and sleeping bag). Bubble Bass starts insulting them after SpongeBob does the same, then the second challenge begins: fighting a bull. They both go to the Duel Arena, find a box and a red scarf, and the box starts making bull noises. Bubble Bass' mother comes out of the box and rages like a bull (because Bubble Bass told his mother that the furniture in the house was chipped by SpongeBob and Squidward), so the two try to hide behind the cloth, but Bubble Bass' mother still attacks them. In the middle of the fight, Mama Bass and Squidward begin to dance the tango, while SpongeBob is fond of it, but suddenly Mama Bass's watch beeps and she tells Squidward that she has to go to a bake sale and to call her. Bubble Bass, when he sees that his mother left, yells ""Why?!"" as the cardboard stage collapses.Then follows the third and final challenge: the joust. Bubble Bass prepares to fight Squidward. When SpongeBob is about to give Squidward his shield, Squidward tells him that he does not need it, while SpongeBob says ""My hero!."" Bubble Bass and Squidward charge to attack each other. Squidward uses his spear and uses so much force that he thrusts it into Bubble Bass's belly button, defeating him. Squidward and SpongeBob approach Bubble Bass and tell him that now he must pay his bill, but Bubble Bass tells them that he spent all his money on the cardboard boxes, so Squidward tells him that Sir Krabs (Mr. Krabs) will know how to fix this.In the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs puts Bubble Bass to work to pay his bill, but Bubble Bass keeps complaining about work, annoying customers in different ways. The clients, angered by Bubble Bass, go directly to Mr. Krabs' office to pay him everything that Bubble Bass owes so that he can leave immediately. Mr. Krabs, already with the Bubble Bass account paid, goes to Bubble Bass, who was washing the dishes in the toilet, and tells him that his bill is already paid and that he can leave, Bubble Bass comes out of the bathroom happily. To Mr. Krabs' surprise and dismay, Bubble Bass does not leave, but instead orders a bunch more food and tells Mr. Krabs that he just opened a new account and goes on top of his cardboard horse, so Mr. Krabs furiously chases after Bubble Bass. Suddenly, SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen with a rose in his mouth and dances the tango with Squidward, but suddenly Mama Bass asks him if she can dance too, to which Squidward says yes.

As he is about to run out of the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs catches him and tells him that the ringing he was hearing was coming from a small bell that he uses to bring in customers.Mr. Krabs uses the bell on several customers, including Incidental 6, in which he then drools on the table in wanting another Krabby Patty. When SpongeBob asks to ring the bell, Mr. Krabs offers him to ring the big bell from the roof. The bell's ring results in people all over Bikini Bottom drooling for Krabby Patties and heading towards the Krusty Krab.As the customers are enjoying their Krabby Patties, Patrick suddenly bursts into the restaurant and throws a tantrum on the floors, causing the customers to leave. SpongeBob calms Patrick down by rubbing jelly on him. When asked what he recently remembers, Patrick gives a flashback to an experience he had as a kid, in which his parents ring a bell to get Patrick to take a bath. In the flashback, he cries out of not wanting one. After the flashback ends, SpongeBob proclaims that he will silence every bell in town, as he smashes through the Krusty Krab roof.Mr. Krabs decides to use Patrick's tantrums to his advantage by encouraging him to participate in a fighting match against Harry the Health Hazard for $1 million. While Mr. Krabs and Patrick watch on at the stadium, SpongeBob deactivates more ringing bells across Bikini Bottom. Back at the stadium, Mr. Krabs puts Patrick in the arena for the match. A bell rings to signal the start of the match, which results in Patrick going crazy. While in his rampage, Patrick, unintentionally, actually fights Harry and ends up hurting him. After Harry is defeated, Mr. Krabs uses jelly to calm Patrick down.

Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is about to put the money he won into the cash register, but a ring goes off when he presses the button, which results in Patrick going crazy again. He ends up destroying the restaurant and rips up Mr. Krabs' money. Patrick's parents come in and praise him for the result of the fight.

SpongeBob attempts to read while driving, but does not notice that they are about to crash into a brick wall. SpongeBob takes a sharp turn to avoid the brick wall, but starts driving towards Mrs. Puff's lighthouse. SpongeBob is able to brake in time to avoid crashing into the lighthouse, but a wave of junk from inside the lighthouse ends up spilling onto them anyway. SpongeBob pulls Mrs. Puff out of the rubble, and tries to make up for the damage he caused, but nothing pleases her. Mrs. Puff exclaims that SpongeBob should clean up her lighthouse, since she has been tossing old junk in there for 20 years. She leaves SpongeBob to the task, and heads back into her classroom to listen to heavy metal music. SpongeBob heads into the lighthouse, and cleans it fairly quickly by eating all of the assorted objects and spitting them back out into boxes. He then notices that the lighthouse is extremely dusty, so he cleans the place up using a mop. As SpongeBob is about to head into the next room to shine the lighthouse's lantern, he hears moaning on the other side of the door.He assumes the lighthouse is haunted, just like his toaster. After a cutaway reveals SpongeBob's toaster really is haunted, SpongeBob slowly opens the door. Suddenly, a box drops from the ceiling, scaring SpongeBob into stumbling down the stairs, and onto a box, causing all the trash that SpongeBob just cleaned up to flood everywhere. SpongeBob is terrified as the box slowly approaches him, only to be relieved when it is revealed that a stray snail was inside. SpongeBob decides to name the snail ""Louie"" as he gets back to work cleaning. However, when SpongeBob tries to continue cleaning, he trips over Louie, prompting SpongeBob to leave Louie outside so he does not get in the way. Although when SpongeBob goes back inside, Louie is also somehow back inside, so SpongeBob decides to tie Louie to a nearby boat so he will be out of his hair. Once again though, Louie is somehow back inside the lighthouse, so SpongeBob attempts to throw him out, only to be thrown out himself. SpongeBob refuses to be outsmarted by a snail, and in the next scene, we see SpongeBob trying to trap Louie in a box by using a can of Krabby Patties as bait. However, SpongeBob is outsmarted yet again, as Louie traps him inside of a box. When SpongeBob is unable to lift up the box himself, he eats some Krabby Patty grease (in a reference to Popeye the Sailor Man) to grow buff and lift the box off of him. Soon after, SpongeBob finds Louie in the room with the lighthouse's lantern, but Louie suddenly becomes feral and attacks SpongeBob, biting him all over his face. In the scuffle, SpongeBob accidentally turns on the lighthouse's light switch, shining a very bright light into Bikini Bottom. Bubble Bass, Larry the Lobster, and a third fish notice the light, as SpongeBob and Louie's shadows are being cast onto it. Larry thinks that they are a couple of buff dudes, while Bubble Bass thinks they are giant monsters, causing the trio to panic.The ruckus eventually causes the lighthouse to tip over and start rolling around Bikini Bottom (unbeknownst to Mrs. Puff, who is still listening to her heavy metal music). Larry and the other fish run away, but Bubble Bass ends up getting flattened by the lighthouse. Afterwards, Perch Perkins is seen interviewing Fred on the news, as Fred frantically explains that a lighthouse caused all the destruction. Perch Perkins asks Fred if the lighthouse injured ""HIS LEGS,"" to which Fred sadly replies no. Mr. Krabs sees this on the news, and tells all of his customers to protect the Krusty Krab. They all run away however, and SpongeBob, not wanting to destroy the Krusty Krab, turns the lighthouse around with his feet. Although, when Louie attacks him again, the lighthouse turns back around and ends up destroying the Krusty Krab anyway, injuring Mr. Krabs in the process. The lighthouse ends up rolling back to Mrs. Puff's boating school and is thrown back into its original position. After the chaos, SpongeBob frantically wonders where Louie is, only to find out that Louie was actually a mother taking care of her babies. SpongeBob comments on how he should start calling her ""Louise"" instead. In the next scene, SpongeBob shows Mrs. Puff the clean lighthouse, to which Mrs. Puff exclaims how proud she is of SpongeBob, giving him a gold star. SpongeBob then shows Mrs. Puff ""Louise"" and her babies, telling her how they were hiding inside the lighthouse. Mrs. Puff finds the snails adorable. SpongeBob leaves boating school for the day, as Mrs. Puff is relieved that SpongeBob did not create a huge disaster. Just then, she is confronted by several Bikini Bottomites, including Mr. Krabs, Bubble Bass, and Larry the Lobster. They are furious that Mrs. Puff's lighthouse has caused so much damage in town, and demand to know what she is going to do about it. In response, Mrs. Puff puts on her headphones and (along with Louise and her babies) start jamming out to her heavy metal music, as the episode ends.",Lighthouse Louie,,0.68,Luke Brookshier

Squidward leans out of his window and screams for the duo to be quiet, threatening to call the cops on them. SpongeBob and Patrick are unable to hear the threat, so Squidward leans out of his window even harder to yell even louder. However, this causes Squidward's house to tip over and collapse, destroying the house. Squidward is saddened that his house is destroyed, so SpongeBob and Patrick offer Squidward to stay at one of their houses, but he refuses. Later that night, Squidward is seen roughing it in a tent where his house used to be, but a sudden rainstorm blows his tent away, leaving him without a shelter. Squidward finally gives in and flips a coin, making him decide to stay at Patrick's house. When Squidward approaches Patrick's house, he is dragged inside by Patrick, and is threatened by a banana Patrick is holding. Squidward identifies himself, and tells Patrick that he will be staying at his place, which thrills the latter. Patrick gives Squidward a bedroom to sleep in, but since everything in Patrick's house is made out of sand, Squidward sleeps without a pillow or blanket. However, he is unable to sleep due to Patrick drooling on his face, and when Squidward yells at him to stop, Patrick wakes up and falls on Squidward, due to thinking there are sand mites in the house.The next morning, Patrick wakes up to find that Squidward has decorated the house to his liking, and is cooking up breakfast in the kitchen. Squidward offers Patrick a lard cake, and as Patrick is about to gobble it down in one bite, Squidward stops him and shows him how to eat like a gentleman. Patrick copies Squidward's habits, making Squidward realize that he can shape Patrick to act like a ""cultured sophisticate."" A montage commences of Squidward and Patrick spending time together with various activities, including gardening, pedicures, playing clarinet, and dancing. During the montage, Patrick starts to adopt Squidward's looks, from growing two extra legs, morphing his face to look like Squidward's, and wearing a shirt instead of pants. In the next scene, Squidward and Patrick are seen opening up an attraction together called the ""Classy Kiosk,"" gathering a crowd. The duo start painting pictures, but the crowd only seems to like Patrick's pictures, buying all of them out. Squidward tries dancing to entertain the audience, but this only ends with Squidward getting hit with tomatoes. Patrick then also dances for the crowd, who end up loving it. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs go up onstage to congratulate Patrick, and Mr. Krabs comments that Patrick makes a better Squidward than Squidward does. Patrick suddenly starts adapting Squidward's mannerisms and speech patterns, making Squidward very upset, while entertaining the public at the same time.Mr. Krabs declares Patrick to be the best Squidward, as him and the crowd of people carry Patrick off. Squidward is enraged by this, claiming Patrick to be an imposter of himself. SpongeBob suggests that if Patrick makes a better Squidward, maybe Squidward will make a better Patrick. Squidward loves the idea, and thanks SpongeBob as he runs off. The next morning, Patrick (who is still acting like Squidward), wakes up to find his house to be a total mess. The cause of this is none other than Squidward (who is now purposefully acting like Patrick). Squidward does many dumb things, from slamming a brick into his face, to shoving Patrick's art up his nose, to eating Patrick's clarinet, all of which annoy and frustrate Patrick. Squidward decides to go outside and play with SpongeBob, while Patrick plans to take a nap. Unfortunately for him, he is woken up by the sound of SpongeBob and Squidward's laughing, as both of them are playing in the mud. As Patrick goes outside to yell at them, Squidward throws a handful of mud into Patrick's mouth, making Patrick remember who he used to be. Patrick changes back to normal and joins the two in the mud puddle. Just then, a helicopter is seen delivering Squidward's new house, much to the thrill of the trio. Unfortunately, his house tips over again and lands on Patrick's house, destroying both homes. In the next scene, Squidward and Patrick are both seen sleeping with SpongeBob in his bed.

At first, Timmy takes out a can of Fizz Bomb soda, drinks it, and then burps, but that does not work. In the second attempt, they eat a bag of spicy kelp chips, which causes their mouths to burn and then hiccup. In the process, they let out hiccup bubbles. Two of their hiccup bubbles touching each other combines into one bigger bubble and Tina gets the jar to put the bubble in. They trap the hiccup bubble in a jar, and laugh about how this will make a great prank. They release the hiccup bubble into Bikini Bottom, which is about to land on an old woman, but she unknowingly blows it away while blowing her nose. The hiccup bubble then lands on SpongeBob while he is skipping down the street, causing him to get the hiccups.Later, at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is about to prepare a fresh batch of Krabby Patties, but his hiccups interfere. At first, SpongeBob uses this to his advantage, using his hiccups to bounce the Krabby Patties off of his head, but this quickly spirals out of control. Mr. Krabs walks into the kitchen to see what is going on, to which he realizes SpongeBob has a case of the hiccups. He attempts to scare the hiccups out of him, but this proves unsuccessful. Mr. Krabs sends SpongeBob home for the day, but not before SpongeBob hiccups the bubble out of his mouth and onto Mr. Krabs, passing the hiccups onto him. Mr. Krabs walks back into the restaurant to greet Mrs. Puff, who is waiting in line, but Mr. Krabs' hiccups prove to be an annoyance. Mrs. Puff claims the hiccups are not contagious and kisses Mr. Krabs on the cheek, and Mr. Krabs unknowingly passes the hiccups onto her. Mrs. Puff then rushes into the restroom and tries drinking water upside down to get rid of the hiccups. Pearl then also walks into the restroom and is confused by what Mrs. Puff is doing. Mrs. Puff then accidentally spits water all over Pearl's pom-poms, making her upset. Mrs. Puff tries to apologize to Pearl, but ends up passing the hiccups to her, causing Pearl to storm out of the restaurant. Pearl attempts to practice cheerleading, but her hiccups get in the way. She ends up passing the hiccups to a group of jellyfish, and she happily finishes her cheer.The jellyfish then fly past the comic book store where Bubble Bass is reading a comic book, and pass the hiccups onto him. His hiccups cause him to sneeze on his comic book, making him upset. Old Man Jenkins then approaches Bubble Bass and mocks him, saying how back in his day, hiccups could turn someone inside out. This also happens to Bubble Bass, who panics and runs away. We then cut to Perch Perkins, who is reporting the Hiccup Plague on the news, but he just laughs it off until Bubble Bass (still inside out) grabs Perch Perkins' microphone, claiming the Hiccup Plague to be real. He then hiccups, causing the hiccup bubble to travel inside the microphone, and into telephone wires leading to the Chum Bucket, causing Karen to get the hiccups, who then passes the hiccups to Plankton. The hiccups cause Plankton to accidentally drop a couple of beakers he was using, which creates an explosion that sends him flying. He then lands on the ground right in front of Patrick, who ends up accidentally stepping on him. He then picks up Plankton, who ends up passing the hiccups onto him. Plankton laughs in his face and then runs away. Patrick then starts hiccupping, causing him to panic, and he bumps into Squidward. Patrick begs Squidward to help him get rid of the hiccups, but then passes the hiccups onto him. Squidward berates Patrick, saying that hiccups are not contagious, but when he starts hiccupping himself, he panics and takes off.We then see Mrs. Puff, Pearl, and Bubble Bass, who are walking down the street together. Squidward then approaches them and starts uncontrollably hiccupping. This causes them to panic and flee. Squidward is then approached by SpongeBob, who states that he will willingly take the hiccups if Squidward hugs him. He begrudgingly does so, and passes the hiccups onto SpongeBob. Squidward then retreats gleefully, while SpongeBob says goodbye to Bikini Bottom, while Timmy and Tina (the two kids from earlier) are seen giggling behind a mailbox. SpongeBob is then seen sitting on a large piece of coral while sipping on a carton of grape juice. SpongeBob then hiccups, causing him to fall off the coral, and lands in Sandy's arms. SpongeBob is alarmed and tells Sandy to stay away from him as he still has the hiccups. Sandy states that she wants to attempt to cure SpongeBob of the hiccups and take him back to her treedome.At Sandy's treedome, SpongeBob is seen in a small tank, while Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff, Pearl, Bubble Bass, Patrick, and Squidward look on. Mr. Krabs once again tries to scare the hiccups out of SpongeBob, but fails. Mrs. Puff suggests drinking water upside down, Pearl suggests to do a cheer, Bubble Bass suggests hiding pickles under his tongue, Patrick suggests eating Snail-Po, and Squidward suggests nothing. SpongeBob tries all of these options, but none of them end up working. Sandy tries to treat the situation ""scientifically"" and tickles SpongeBob, which actually ends up working. The hiccup bubble floats out of the Treedome as everyone cheers. The hiccup bubble then floats back to the treehouse where Tina and Timmy are laughing, but the hiccups are passed onto them. They both start hiccupping, causing their treehouse to jump up and down, as the episode ends.",Hiccup Plague,,0.44,Luke Brookshier

He tells SpongeBob to lock the windows, always keep a weapon on his person and to not step foot into his bedroom. Mr. Krabs hands SpongeBob a baseball bat, but SpongeBob accidentally hits himself with it, making Mr. Krabs throw the bat away. Mr. Krabs further explains that Pearl is staying with friends, and that SpongeBob will be all alone. He then warns that the neighborhood has seen a spike in robberies recently, and orders SpongeBob to not answer the door for anyone. As Mr. Krabs leaves, he tests this by knocking on his own door as SpongeBob answers, but SpongeBob realizes his mistake and slams the door in Mr. Krabs' face, much to Krabs' satisfaction. In the next scene, SpongeBob is seen checking around the house, making sure there are no robbers about. He then notices Mr. Krabs' bedroom, and suspects that burglars might be hiding, but remembers that he is not allowed to set foot in there. To get around this, SpongeBob ties a balloon to his nose. While searching through Mr. Krabs' bedroom, SpongeBob finds money under his pillow, a music box with a Mrs. Puff figurine, a bottle of cologne called ""Midnight Pincer,"" and a knot collection. SpongeBob suddenly hears a doorbell, and assumes it's the pizza that he ordered earlier. SpongeBob tells the delivery boy to slide the pizza into the mail slot, since he isn't allowed to open the door.Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs arrives at the Bikini Bottom Convention Hall for the Fast Food Founding Fathers (or F.F.F.F.) convention. The doorman asks Mr. Krabs to pay 10 cents as an entrance fee, but Mr. Krabs thinks 10 cents is a ripoff and decides to go home. As Mr. Krabs is taking off, he overhears another fish winning 1,000 dollars for being the 100th person to enter the building, much to his shock. Back at Mr. Krabs' house, SpongeBob is seen watching TV, but when a horror movie comes on, he turns off the TV in fright. Just then, a knock is heard at the door, and SpongeBob approaches cautiously. It is Mr. Krabs, who cannot enter his house because he forgot his keys. SpongeBob does not believe him, however, as he thinks that Mr. Krabs is still at his convention. SpongeBob admits that the ""robber"" sounds like Mr. Krabs, but looks nothing like him (due to the door's peephole distorting Mr. Krabs' appearance thus making him look different). Mr. Krabs attempts to get in through the mail slot, but fails due to him being too big. He then notices that the top window is open, and starts climbing on the side of his house in order to reach it. In a frenzy, SpongeBob calls Patrick on the phone and asks him to come over to Krabs' house, due to thinking the ""burglar"" is trying to break in. Patrick arrives shortly, and is able to enter the house via the mail slot, due to him having no bones and being completely made out of blubber. At the same time, Mr. Krabs is able to approach his window, but is struck down by lightning. SpongeBob and Patrick decide to start setting up traps for the robber.In the next scene, Mr. Krabs' house is filled with booby traps, such as pillows being hung from the ceiling, and a bucket of warm water being set under the window. They hear glass breaking, and prepare all the traps for use. Mr. Krabs tries to break in through the window, but is sprayed in the eyes by his own perfume, and lands in a puddle of mud. Afterwards, Mr. Krabs tries to enter his house via the toilet (while still covered in mud), but SpongeBob is able to intercept him and flush him back down the toilet using a plunger. Once again, Mr. Krabs tries breaking in, this time through his pet door, but is nearly sliced up by ""sharp"" cheddar. SpongeBob and Patrick celebrate their victory over the robber by watching a tough guy action movie on TV. At the same time, though, Mr. Krabs has had enough and decides to use a giant wrecking ball to break into his own house, and SpongeBob and Patrick are unaware of this due to the sound effects in the movie. Mr. Krabs finally manages to break in, but is trapped inside of a laundry basket held down by a cinderblock. At this point, Mr. Krabs gives up and starts crying, handing SpongeBob and Patrick his ID card to prove he's the real Mr. Krabs. Realizing their mistake, SpongeBob and Patrick release Mr. Krabs from the trap and apologize for attacking him the whole night. However, Mr. Krabs isn't mad at them, due to SpongeBob actually following his orders. After the trio exchange a hug, they hear more knocking at the door. It's Pearl, who also forgot her keys, but Mr. Krabs doesn't believe her (due to, once again, the door's peephole distorting Pearl's appearance). SpongeBob and Patrick are prepared to set up more traps, and Pearl is seen still banging on the front door, as the episode ends.","Knock Knock, Who's There?",,0.34,Kaz

He then goes into his office, steals a strawberry ice cream sandwich from Squidward's lunch, and takes off his shell before going into a tanning booth in his room as part of him getting ready for his date with Mrs. Puff. While SpongeBob is serving a Krabby Patty to Patrick, he hears Mr. Krabs saying it is hot in his office. Thinking that he is in trouble, he goes inside, only to see Mr. Krabs' shell empty and the melted ice cream sandwich, which he thinks is blood, all over him.SpongeBob gets sad, fearing Mr. Krabs has died from exsanguination, but when Squidward hears about this, knowing the truth about Mr. Krabs, decides to play along. When he tells them Mr. Krabs had a date, SpongeBob gets the idea to fill the shell with chum so he can still go to the date. He, as well as Patrick, go to his house after buying chum from Plankton, and fill the shell with the chum as organs.Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs gets out of the tanning booth, only to realize his shell is gone. He tries to go to his house without being seen to get clothes, but upon reaching there, Pearl and her friends see him naked. At the same time, SpongeBob and Patrick have taught Chum Krabs everything he needs to know for the date. They send him to Mrs. Puff's house to bring her to Fancy!, right before the real Mr. Krabs arrives to do the same thing.While Mrs. Puff and Chum Krabs are on a date, Mr. Krabs goes to Fancy! so he can have the date. Upon seeing Chum Krabs with his date, he gets angry and tries to stop the imposter. Noticing this, SpongeBob and Patrick grab Mr. Krabs and throw him out of the restaurant believing he's an impostor, only for Squidward to arrive and tell the two the Mr. Krabs they threw out was the real one, and takes the opportunity to mock his tuxedo as payback for stealing his lunch before leaving. Realizing his mistake, SpongeBob apologizes to Mr. Krabs and explains the situation. Chum Krabs then comes out of the restaurant with Mrs. Puff, and Mr. Krabs gets into a fight with him, knocking him out of his shell.Chum Krabs soon gains the upper hand, but he can't maintain his shape without the shell and melts, allowing Mr. Krabs to win the fight, and he and Mrs. Puff get back together, while SpongeBob and Patrick get taken by the remains of Chum Krabs, as the episode ends.",My Two Krabses,,0.68,Andrew Goodman

When he pretends to be a ghost, he gets an idea to steal the secret formula. After Karen unplugs herself, Plankton creates a ghost extracting machine, and turns into a ghost. By being a ghost, he can go through walls, which is how he got into the safe in the Krusty Krab. However, by being a ghost, he can go through walls, but he cannot pick things up either, leading to what seems to be a failure.That is when the Flying Dutchman appears on Mr. Krabs' chair, cackling, and tells Plankton that it takes some training to pick things up, and he picks up the bottle on his first try. So the training begins.First off, the Flying Dutchman tells Plankton that he needs to learn the art of shapeshifting, in which one should think of a scary thought, and then they become that scary thought. The Flying Dutchman turns into multiple scary things, and then it is Plankton's turn. He turns into a weird shape, but since it is not scary, he becomes a duplicate of the Flying Dutchman. Accepting the pupil's talent, the Flying Dutchman whacks him with a mallet. They move on to lesson two.In order to be a proper ghost, one has to scare others. The Flying Dutchman scares the life out of a thief, and when Plankton does his scare, he accidentally scares himself through a mirror. The Flying Dutchman accepts it, hits him with a golf club, and they move on to lesson three.For this lesson, one has to make another's life a nightmare by haunting their house. The Flying Dutchman and Plankton go over to Squidward's house, and the haunting begins. Plankton becomes Squidward's bed and shakes, waking Squidward up. When he finds out his bed is haunted, Squidward hides in the dresser, with his clarinet. But he plays his clarinet badly, and a few seconds later, an annoyed Plankton pulls the clarinet from Squidward and morphs into a SpongeBob ghost, and becomes visible. Squidward tries to escape, but knocks himself unconscious. Plankton, realizing he took the clarinet, finds out that he can pick things up now. They move onto the final lesson.In this final lesson, the Flying Dutchman tells Plankton that he has to be really angry in order to pick something up. On a second attempt to steal the formula, Plankton picks it up just fine after hearing the Dutchman's advice. However, when he tries to take it out of the safe, the bottle will not go through the wall, as it is not a ghost. After admitting defeat, he decides to go back to his regular body.But when he enters the Chum Bucket, he is surprised to find out that Karen had invited everyone to Plankton's funeral because he left his body alone for too long. His corpse lay on a coffin, and Plankton feels like getting into his body when the Flying Dutchman says he is dead forever. Plankton denies it, saying he is only a ""temporary"" ghost, but an eager Flying Dutchman goes into Plankton's body to be alive again. Believing that Plankton played a cruel joke by pretending to be dead, all the mourners, except SpongeBob, get real angry. They form a mob and stomp on the Flying Dutchman in Plankton's body. He decides to give up and give Plankton his body back stating that the Flying Dutchman would rather be dead than alive. Plankton happily accepts, and even after being stomped multiple times by the people, he says that it is good to be alive. To end the episode, the Flying Dutchman does a jump scare in front of a ""The End"" card.",The Ghost of Plankton,,1.00,Doug Lawrence

His sister Squidina gets annoyed and calls security to kick him out. Outside, Patrick sees two of the workers at Goofy Goobers receiving ice cream on their break, prompting him to apply for the job.The manager of the place shows Patrick the history of Goofy Goobers, as well as what he needs to do to be a good employee. He first tasks Patrick to clean the dishes. After they are all cleaned, the manager asks him how he cleaned them. Patrick says he cleaned them using his saliva, disgusting the manager.The manager gives Patrick his next job, which is to unload ice cream boxes from a truck into the freezer. Patrick attempts to do this, but since he feels cold in there, he turns the heat on, which causes a flood and annoys the manager.Afterwards, the manager tasks Patrick to go into the Goofy Goober mascot costume to entertain the kids. While inside it, Patrick sees that there is unattended ice cream, and decides to suck it all into his costume. The manager finds out about this and tells Patrick if he fails at the job the next day, he will fire him. Patrick comes back home and tells SpongeBob, who was sitting on his rock house, about his day. SpongeBob tells Patrick he will help him out at work so Patrick does not get fired.SpongeBob hides inside of Patrick's uniform and starts working at the place efficiently. The manager is impressed with Patrick and finally gives him a break, allowing him to get the free ice cream he wanted. Patrick wanted to share the ice cream with SpongeBob, but the latter is almost late for the Krusty Krab, so Patrick is all on his own eating. However, Patrick realizes his break is almost over, so he tries to eat all the ice cream he can. However, he eats so much ice cream that he gets a brain freeze, causing the Earth to freeze for five billion years. When it becomes unfrozen, the manager fires Patrick. Since he was lactose intolerant anyways, the episode ends with him walking out the restaurant into a UFO happily.",The Goofy Newbie,,1.28,Kaz

Mr. Krabs is managing everything smoothly, while barking orders at SpongeBob and Squidward. Mr. Krabs helps out the customers with their problems, whether it be refilling a man's drink, giving another customer ketchup, or a slicing a Krabby Patty into small pieces for a little baby to eat. Mr. Krabs also manages to fight off a group of pirates at the same time all of this is happening. After all of that, Mr. Krabs' claw smells cash, and finds a penny on the floor. Mr. Krabs delightfully claims the penny, but almost immediately afterwards, SpongeBob kicks open the kitchen door, accidentally knocking Mr. Krabs all over the restaurant until he eventually lands in the middle of the street. A construction worker hoisting up a piano becomes distracted when he notices the penny that Mr. Krabs found earlier fell out of his pocket, causing Mr. Krabs to be crushed by the piano. An ambulance arrives immediately, but before they take Mr. Krabs away, SpongeBob asks who will be in charge of the Krusty Krab while he is out. Mr. Krabs is about to point at Squidward, but he puts SpongeBob in front of him, officially making SpongeBob the boss of the Krusty Krab until Mr. Krabs recovers, much to Mr. Krabs' dismay. Squidward mocks SpongeBob, saying that he will probably ruin everything ""like he always does."" SpongeBob decides that if he wants to boss like Mr. Krabs, he will have to act like him too.Later on, a nurse is wheeling Mr. Krabs, who is in a full body cast, back to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob greets him at the front door, and wheels him inside of the restaurant to show him how he has been taking care of things. He reveals that he hired Patrick to be the new fry cook of the Krusty Krab, since he is too busy being the boss now, much to Mr. Krabs' distress. SpongeBob shows Mr. Krabs how much of an effective boss he is by helping two troubled customers; one of which needs a napkin, and the other having a wobbly table. Nearby, Squidward yells at a customer, which results in SpongeBob scolding him. SpongeBob makes Squidward wear a helmet that forces him to smile to appear more friendly to the customer, but it only creeps him out instead. Squidward is about to blow up at SpongeBob, but they suddenly hear a slicing sound coming from the kitchen, and SpongeBob goes to check it out. It is Patrick, attempting to clean the deli-slicer with a pair of tongs. SpongeBob offers to take care of the situation, while Patrick gets back to work. In the next scene, Patrick is trying to make a Krabby Patty, but SpongeBob micromanages everything he does, even down to the tiniest detail. This annoys Patrick to the point where he quits, but not before taking off all of his clothes. Patrick slams the door on his way out, and SpongeBob gets caught in the spinning door, resulting in a part of himself being sliced off. SpongeBob ends up leaving the SpongeBob slice clone in charge of the cooking. Out in the dining room, Squidward is being pestered by an angry mob. This prompts him to storm out of the restaurant, but not before SpongeBob attempts to stop him. It does not work however, as Squidward screams in SpongeBob's face that he quits for good, angrily leaving the Krusty Krab.The angry mob turns to SpongeBob, but he quickly thinks of the solution to slice off another clone of himself and put him in charge of the cash register. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that everything is now under control, but out of nowhere, tons of things start going wrong at once. One woman spills her drink, another man slips in the spill and falls, one customer complains that the TV does not work, one customer complains that it is too hot, and another customer complains that it is too cold. The pressure eventually gets to SpongeBob, as he screams at the tops of his lungs for everyone to stop. SpongeBob runs back into the kitchen and starts slicing off multiple clones of himself, all of which assist each and every customer with their problems. Suddenly, Patrick (who is still naked) bursts through the front door, saying that he is just ""cleaning out his desk"" (although in actuality, he just steals a family's meal). Patrick leaves the door open though, resulting in the SpongeBob slice clones being blown around the restaurant and eventually being sliced to bits via the Krusty Krab's ceiling fan. All of the customers are grossed out by the sponge bits and leave the establishment, making Mr. Krabs furious to the point where he breaks out of his body cast. SpongeBob (who is now stuck in the ceiling fan) apologizes to Mr. Krabs for messing everything up and explains that he wanted to be like him. Mr. Krabs forgives him, saying that the rage he felt watching him destroy his restaurant forced his body to heal very quickly, but also states that SpongeBob's pay will have to be docked for decades to cover all the damage SpongeBob caused. Mr. Krabs turns on the ceiling fan and laughs, while SpongeBob spins around in the ceiling fan, as the episode ends.",Boss for a Day,,0.73,Andrew Goodman

Plankton comes and tries to arm wrestle with Mr. Krabs. Plankton almost wins, but it turns out Mr. Krabs was just playing with him and wins with ease. After Plankton gets humiliated, he goes back to the Chum Bucket. He gets the idea to use the Chum Bucket glove to win the fight, so he brings it to life using electricity and goes back to Mr. Krabs for a rematch. Mr. Krabs scoffs at this, but Plankton then shows the glove, who defeats Krabs very easily. The glove dumps everyone there inside a hole and Plankton leaves while riding the glove.Plankton goes to the Krusty Krab so he can steal the formula, but the glove decides to stop following Plankton's orders and puts him in hot sauce, severely hurting him. After the glove leaves, Plankton opens up the security box at the restaurant, which turns out to have SpongeBob inside as he sometimes guards it during the night. He decides to help Plankton with his issue after hearing about it, and the two go into town to defeat the glove. Plankton first tries to shoot rockets at it, but ends up exploding himself instead of the glove.SpongeBob tells him he can only defeat it with love, so they go inside a white glove to trick the Chum Bucket glove into falling in love with it. It almost works, but while eating spaghetti, the glove accidentally slurps the other glove, revealing SpongeBob and Plankton to have been inside the entire time. This causes the glove to get angry due to losing his love.Later, SpongeBob is crying near his home due to failing to help Plankton. When Plankton tells SpongeBob to ""keep his pants on,"" this gives SpongeBob the idea to bring Hans with them to help them defeat the glove. After Hans is introduced, he gets the idea that the glove is at Glove World!, which turns out to be true, as it is terrorizing the fish at the amusement park. Hans decides to put up a fight with the glove, but since he is unable to defeat the glove on his own, he asks SpongeBob and Plankton to create a distraction.The two come up with the plan to insult the glove to get its attention. When Plankton uses SpongeBob as a bullhorn to say the insult, Hans uses the distraction as a way to put the glove on him. Back at the Chum Bucket, the glove is replaced by a combat boot, which Plankton considers better than a glove.

The three fall asleep after a while, but once Sandy wakes up, she realizes SpongeBob has got out and is biting her nails, making her send him to a hypnotherapist.The hypnotherapist finds out that SpongeBob thinks he is Squidward and has subconsciously implanted the nail-biting habit from him, and that is why he wants to bite his nails. He then gives an order once he snaps his fingers, SpongeBob will become himself again, and his desire to bite ""his"" nails will disappear. He snaps his fingers and he goes back to normal. At first SpongeBob seems fine, but once it turns out that the hypnotherapist was Hans, the hypnosis seems to have backfired and SpongeBob has not completely gotten over his nail-biting habit, so instead of biting his own nails, he bites the nails of Hans. At the same time arrives Squidward due to his weekly appointment and, scared from SpongeBob biting Hans' nails, nervously bites his nails, backs away, and shuts the door, ending the episode from there.",SpongeBob's Bad Habit,,1.43,Luke Brookshier

He is wearing a Hawaiian shirt, has a suitcase in hand, and has an exterminator's fumigation tent covering his house. SpongeBob comes over and thinks that the tent is a circus tent, but Squidward angrily tells him otherwise, saying that the tent is for getting rid of sea urchins that have infested his house. It turns out this is because SpongeBob is responsible, due to feeding them popcorn. Patrick suddenly comes out of the tent, also thinking that his house is a circus, exclaiming that it was boring. He also thinks the cotton balls are candy and eats them. Annoyed by their stupidity, Squidward storms off and boards the arriving bus, and also tells SpongeBob and Patrick that he will be staying at a hotel for the next few days in order to have peace and quiet. After he leaves, SpongeBob and Patrick begin a conga with the sea urchins.In the next scene, Squidward arrives at the hotel, and meets the manager. After the manager cracks a couple jokes, much to Squidward's annoyance, Squidward gets his room key. Squidward is very delighted with his room, and decides to relax by taking a bath. While bathing, SpongeBob and Patrick are seen running through Squidward's room, and end up bumping into each other, excitedly exclaiming on how much they love playing ""Hotel Slam N' Run."" After they leave, Squidward comes out of the bathroom, knowing that he heard a noise, but soon brushes it off as him being ""not relaxed enough.""Soon after, Squidward decides to order room service for his hotel room, but SpongeBob and Patrick (who have their voices disguised), are on the other end. After hanging up the phone, the hotel manager comes back and thanks SpongeBob and Patrick for filling in for him on the phone, giving the two a treat as a reward. SpongeBob and Patrick arrive to Squidward's room on a cart, and are happy to see their friend. Squidward is not so happy though, and demands an explanation as to why SpongeBob and Patrick are also in the hotel. They explain that the hotel is hosting this year's annual Jellyfishing Convention, and that Squidward's hotel room is in-between both of theirs. When they ask Squidward to come to the convention with them, he naturally refuses as he is not interested. As SpongeBob and Patrick conga-line out of Squidward's room, Squidward boards up his room and yells for SpongeBob and Patrick to stay away from him and leave him alone. Later, Squidward tries to enjoy various activities in the hotel, such as the spa, gym, and pool areas, but SpongeBob and Patrick disobey his pleas and appear in each of his activities, annoying him by their presence. After Squidward leaves the pool area, he sees SpongeBob and Patrick in the hotel halls, and tries to escape them, only to see them at every single turn (with one exception, where he somehow sees Mrs. Puff when he turns around). SpongeBob and Patrick begin to corner Squidward as he backs up against a door and begs for SpongeBob and Patrick to leave him alone, but SpongeBob slyly warns that the door behind him leads to the Jellyfishing Convention. Soon enough, a couple of the attendees at the convention notice Squidward, and drag him inside, leaving SpongeBob and Patrick to follow, which was their plan all along.Everyone at the convention welcomes Squidward with open arms, but he hates it. Later, SpongeBob and Patrick notice Squidward hiding in the corner, and are happy that everyone seems to love him. Squidward is not happy though, saying that everyone loves him so much that they will not let him leave. A pair of fish confirm this, saying that they love Squidward, as both of them head into the restrooms while leaving their Jellyfish mascot costume behind. Squidward suddenly gets an idea; if he puts the costume on, he can leave the convention undetected. As he is doing so, an announcement is made at the convention, much to the excitement of the crowd: it's time for the annual Jellyfish mascot hunt! Squidward runs away in panic, and the crowd, including SpongeBob and Patrick, give chase through the halls of the hotel. Squidward soon notices there is a button inside the suit called ""The Zapper,"" which allows him to electrocute anything with the costume's tentacles. Squidward gets a kick out of this, and starts running back towards the crowd, gleefully zapping people left and right. He soon approaches the manager at his desk and zaps him too. Squidward then grabs the nearby phone and calls pest control, frantically telling them that the hotel has an infestation of jellyfish... fanatics. Exterminators arrive and cover the entire hotel with a fumigation tent, forcing all the attendees, including SpongeBob and Patrick, to evacuate in fright, and SpongeBob and Patrick question if Squidward made it out okay. The episode then cuts to inside the hotel, where Squidward is seen in his room, happily dancing while wearing a gas mask, as the episode ends.",Jolly Lodgers,,0.80,Kaz

Karen cherishes this date as one to remember. To continue to impress Karen, Plankton dresses up as Ray Ray. Just as Plankton and Karen are about to kiss, Plankton notices Mr. Krabs driving away in his boat, leaving the Krabby Patty formula behind. Plankton interrupts his kiss with Karen as he drops down to steal the formula. However, his hands go right through the formula, unable to touch it. The formula soon disappears, as it is revealed that he was under a simulation at the Chum Bucket run by Karen.Karen gets angry at Plankton for always interrupting their dates. Plankton tries to explain himself, attempting to get the formula for both of them, but Karen places the Chum Bucket on lockdown unless Plankton can prove his romance towards her without interruptions. On the next date, Plankton cooks up stew for Karen. He soon peeks at the Krusty Krab, seeing Mr. Krabs drive away without the formula again. Plankton tries to unscrew a window to go after the formula, but Karen soon notices him, with Plankton explaining that he was finishing up the stew and throws the screw into the pot.Looking outside, Plankton notices Patrick running by the Krusty Krab. Plankton uses a microphone to get his attention, attempting to make him grab the formula. Patrick eventually does grab the formula, but Plankton soon notices he is gone. Patrick ends up randomly appearing in the Chum Bucket, having brought in the wrong bottle. Plankton, again looking outside, notices the formula roll towards the Chum Bucket while Larry, SpongeBob, and a few others exercise. Karen asks Plankton about her dinner, as he replies that it is almost ready. Plankton then gets the idea of disguising Patrick as Ray Ray, sawing Patrick to his size and shape and placing a microphone in his tooth.Patrick, as Ray Ray, gives Karen her dinner. Meanwhile, Plankton uses a lighter to reveal a way out the Chum Bucket. Patrick bites Karen's wheels, while Plankton gets him to massage them. Soon after, Mr. Krabs notices the formula is gone, so he makes his way towards the Krusty Krab. He goes crazy at the Krusty Krab trying to look for it, before realizing it might be with Plankton. He tries to enter the Chum Bucket, as Plankton continues to light his way out. Karen notices the noise, but Plankton manages to distract her again. Plankton finally lights his way out as he tries to get the formula into the Chum Bucket, but he can't fit the bottle through the hole. Mr. Krabs notices Plankton, attempting to grab it from him.Karen compliments Plankton, saying that she was so impressed with the date that she has uploaded the formula inside her. Plankton decides to let go of the formula as he goes towards Karen. Just as Karen is about to reveal the formula, Plankton anxiously asks for it, angering her.

Plankton becomes horrified, because he does not want the baby, but Karen states that it is already too late to cancel the order. Plankton tries to prevent the baby from being delivered by having the Chum Bucket Glove fight the stork-shaped drone, but the drone delivering the baby stops him. Karen starts taking care of her new baby and names him Chip after her grandfather, much to the dismay of Plankton. SpongeBob comes along to greet the baby and give compressed air as a present.Karen takes a good care of her baby, while Plankton neglectfully ignores his son. Later, Chip upgrades from baby into toddler, as seen he grows feet and starts walking. Plankton tries to show off by walking himself, but ends up tripping and falling into a nearby trash can. Chip then upgrades and grows up to be a walking handheld payment terminal.Karen brings Chip to the arcade to have fun, but Chip goes inside of a video game to battle the monsters inside. This worries Karen, who tells Chip to get out of the game. Chip does not listen, so Karen grabs the arcade machine and forces Chip out of the game. When he gets out, he upgrades again, this time into a teenager, and curses at his mom for preventing him from playing the game. Karen gets offended by this and angrily drags Chip home. There, she tells Plankton he needs to talk to his son while she cools off. While talking with Chip, Plankton thinks Karen does not get Chip, as he was beating the game very easily. He tells Chip that he should run away, so Chip leaves the Chum Bucket and heads out into the Bikini Bottom streets.Once Chip's gone, Karen arrives and asks Plankton how his conversation with Chip going, which Plankton tells her that he is a good bot. Karen agrees, until she sees no sign of Chip and asks where is he. Plankton tells her that he told him to run away. Karen gets angry at Plankton for telling Chip to run away. Karen explodes in rage and unleashes electronic weapons to physically harm Plankton and tells him he needs to bring him back or else he is not allowed in the Chum Bucket.Meanwhile, Chip meets a robot gang in an alley and wants to join it. However, it turns out they want to take Chip's parts, which frightens him and causes him to try and escape the gang. Plankton, who is searching for Chip via a tank, hears the commotion and heads off to rescue his new son. However, the robots destroy Plankton's tank and chase him around the alley. Chip breaks free from the magnet he got attached to and saves Plankton by using an ice cream machine to defeat the robot gang. The two go back to the Chum Bucket, with Plankton bragging to Karen about how Chip said his name before he said her name. At the same time, Chip upgrades again and has to go to college, causing both Karen and Plankton to cry tears of joy.Eight semesters later, Chip, now adult, is shown working as an ATM at the First Nautical Bank, playing a trick on Mr. Krabs by not letting him get the money he earned. Karen and Plankton are shown to be very proud of their son.

Squidward says there is something wrong with the gap in his teeth, and that something can get caught in there and obstruct his breathing. So SpongeBob demands a doctor, but Squidward offers to be his dentist.He takes SpongeBob to the kitchen and forces his two teeth together, but this causes SpongeBob's voice to become deeper and more smooth sounding along with no more whistling sound. SpongeBob notices his new change in voice as a jazz singer and starts to sing. Squidward and the customers in the Krusty Krab take notice of the singing. They crowd around to listen to his music. Squidward notices this as a chance to be cool as well. So, he asks SpongeBob to join him in going to his favorite Jazz club, Blow Your Top Lounge. SpongeBob accepts the offer.That night, Squidward barges into the club and attempts to act cool, but everyone else is not impressed. Then SpongeBob comes in and everyone is impressed at how cool he is. So, they are surprised Squidward is his friend and guess if he is a friend of SpongeBob, he is cool. The only person skeptical of Squidward is kicked away by him. Squidward encourages SpongeBob to start singing, and so he goes on stage. Also, Squidward follows along with his clarinet, only to be tricked into putting a cork in his clarinet.SpongeBob once again wows them with his music. But his teeth separate while singing, changing his voice back to normal, forcing Squidward to take teeth from another fish and put them in SpongeBob's mouth. The teeth fall out and shatter at the end of the performance. Squidward wants to leave the club and says to everyone that they will return again tomorrow. He takes him back to the Krusty Krab and cements his teeth back together. Then they return to the club to play. Once again, his teeth separate. So Squidward once again cements his teeth together. Then SpongeBob allows Squidward to do a solo with his clarinet. Squidward eventually blows so hard he launches the cork out, turning back to the music the club hates.A bodyguard then grabs him and throws him outside. Oblivious to his lack of talent but angry at being overlooked, Squidward goes back to make the gap again. He charges with a hammer, only to be blown away by SpongeBob's music bubbles. He crashes into the lights and sandbags, which fall to the ground, all missing SpongeBob. That is, until he runs into a sandbag still hanging and crashes to the ground. SpongeBob then realizes his gap is back. So Squidward comes out and calls him a fraud, but SpongeBob does not seem to mind now that he has his whistle back, and so he whistles.Everyone else in the club is impressed, and they slam their heads to make gaps in their teeth. Squidward attempts to leave, only to be stopped by the bodyguard and the manager tells him to pay for the damages done to the building when SpongeBob blew the roof off with his singing.",Mind the Gap,,1.14,Doug Lawrence

When SpongeBob tries to turn it on, it is too heavy and topples over, causing it to bounce around, and eventually break into pieces. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to get a new clock, but SpongeBob would not because he and the clock have through so much together (In other words, SpongeBob has had his foghorn alarm clock for years and built up good will with it).At first, SpongeBob tries to fix it, but Patrick, trying to help his friend, breaks it completely, forcing SpongeBob to buy another one at the alarm clock store. In the store, the seller tells SpongeBob that his alarms are no longer being produced, so SpongeBob decides to buy the whole store in order to choose a suitable alarm clock from the set.However, not one of the alarms can wake SpongeBob, making him late for work every time. This forces Mr. Krabs to tell SpongeBob that if he is late again, he will fire him and hire another chef. At home, SpongeBob invents and creates a mechanism that will prevent him from being late for work, and as a plus, he will be able to sleep while this mechanism makes Krabby Patties. However, the mechanism breaks when Bubble Bass returns his order due to not having extra pickles, but Mr. Krabs does not fire SpongeBob, he warns if he does not show up, he will have to open and close the Krusty Krab an hour later, something SpongeBob overreacts to.

SpongeBob finally chooses a book called Swamp Mates, about two buffoons in a bog. After book-bugs leave, the story begins.The story starts with Man Ray robbing the bank. Unfortunately for him, a ship comes from the sky, containing Bubble Bass. The hero escapes the ship and captures Man Ray with his posterior. It is then revealed that the act happened a week earlier, as Bubble Bass and a gang of superheroes are seen watching it on TV in the Mermalair. Bubble Bass introduces the rest to their newest member, Wonder Whale, but she is not at the Mermalair, late for her appointment, as Bubble Bass said. The chief then comes on TV with important news about Wonder Whale, who has been kidnapped by Hoodoo Guru, the Voodoo Villain. Most of the heroes get shocked by the news and faint, while Bubble Bass becomes tough and would do anything to find her. However, the sound of his mother's voice claims the whole thing imaginary, and thus Bubble Bass is seen in the basement of his mother's house.While Bubble Bass was searching for his Wonder Whale action figure, his mother arranged a playdate for him, which is revealed to be with Patrick. The former freaks out about it, especially when Patrick is playing with his action figures. Eventually, it gets to the point when Patrick fills the room with swamp water, and a whirlpool forms in the middle of the basement. The Wonder Whale action figure is seen swirling around the center, but the two playmates are too late to save it, and they too, get sucked down.Bubble Bass and Patrick end up in a swamp with a single log as a raft. After realizing what a swamp is like, Bubble Bass notices a figure with his Wonder Whale action figure. They lose him, assuming he is in a shack. The residents of the dilapidated dwelling take them inside, thinking they were trying to steal their illegal hot sauce that could blow anyone's head off, which is what happens to Patrick before he states that it is not spicy. Bubble Bass and Patrick decide to run away, with the group after them. After a long chase, the hot sauce finally causes Patrick to go full-dragon, so he burns the boat that the hot sauce gang was on.Afterward, the two playmates find the robber again and fall into his snare trap. The villain then reveals himself as Hoodoo Guru, the Voodoo Villain, who stole the action figure to complete his collection. Patrick then offers spaghetti to Bubble Bass, which he got from the net, and Patrick eats the rest, releasing both of them as they land on Hoodoo and retrieve Wonder Whale. But the Voodoo Villain subsequently grabs a Patrick action figure without red spots. This is soon revealed to control Patrick, as his body matches how the action figure posed. After getting back the Wonder Whale action figure, Hoodoo positions Patrick about to throw Bubble Bass, but the villain unintentionally throws Bubble Bass toward himself, and he once again gets defeated.After the swamp mates declare victory, the hot sauce gang re-encounter them, and another chase commences. Unfortunately, the log swam away, but when Bubble Bass was ready to surrender, Patrick gave him trust by becoming his boat. On the other hand, the gang brings the Voodoo Villain with them. But the mention of the power of reluctant friendship freaks them out as they retreat, or that is what Bubble Bass thought. They were really running away from a waterfall from behind the two playmates, and the latter fall down the waterfall.Just after, Bubble Bass wakes up as Patrick performs CPR on Bubble Bass, claiming that he was ""dead"" for ten minutes. The whole thing ended up being a hallucination. Patrick's confidence about the indoor pool, and a slap in the back, release the Wonder Whale action figure from inside Bubble Bass. After his mother complained about the mess in the basement, Bubble Bass says he would prefer the swamp, and Patrick says that that was the best playdate ever. The episode ends with the chief finding a Patrick action figure which completed his collection, a reflection of Hoodoo and his collection.",Swamp Mates,,0.89,Luke Brookshier

He opens the register to see that it is full, with money falling out. Mr. Krabs vacuums up the money from the register and collects more as he exits the restaurant. He sees a customer across the street that does not want to get in line. He ends up getting a burger and soda from an approaching food truck. Although he says that the burger is not as good as a Krabby Patty, he appreciates the convenience of not having to move, which gives Mr. Krabs the idea to bring the Krusty Krab to the customers. He takes SpongeBob and Squidward outside to show them a Krusty Krab food truck and he asks them to sell Krabby Patties to customers they approach. Mr. Krabs makes Squidward drive the truck, with SpongeBob agreeing to serve as navigation.SpongeBob and Squidward drive through Bikini Bottom, attempting to sell Krabby Patties to customers, including construction workers, but they are unsuccessful, with other food trucks continually getting in their way.

They chase him throughout Rock Bottom, failing to catch up to him. They see him swing around a streetlight, but he disappears again. SpongeBob tries using jellyfishing to his advantage, and he and Squidward also set a trap, but they get stung by jellyfish after both attempts.SpongeBob and Squidward reach a bus stop, and they slide out of the food truck to rest on a bench. Bert approaches them and angrily asks them why they were chasing after him. SpongeBob asks him why he was waving at them, but Bert reveals that he was drying his armpits. SpongeBob explains that they were only trying to sell a Krabby Patty to him. He almost agrees to buy one, until a bus approaches, revealing that the other Rock Bottomites went to the Krusty Krab. Incidental 222 gives Bert a Krusty Krab meal. Bert then tells SpongeBob and Squidward he no longer needs to buy from them.Back at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is shown with a wheelbarrow of money, mentioning that he has gained them from Rock Bottomites. SpongeBob and Squidward arrive, and Mr. Krabs asks how they did. SpongeBob replies that they have not sold any Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs gets really infuriated until saying that he has not eaten anything throughout the day. Squidward gives Mr. Krabs a Krabby Patty, but asks him to pay.

SpongeBob decides to join, so the two go inside one of the boxes and see the club in its entirety. The two give their brains at the door and soon afterwards, the Empty Heads have a meeting.Everyone goes to the meeting and the Ice Cream King is revealed to be the club president who started the meeting. He gets his secretary to read the minutes and then asks if there are any new recruits at the club. Patrick tells SpongeBob to go, as he wanted to join the club, so he goes up on the stage. The Ice Cream King checks to see if SpongeBob is dumb enough, and then tells everyone to pass a jar of saliva while SpongeBob drinks lemonade. However, SpongeBob thinks they are referring to the jar of saliva, and drinks that, causing everyone to get disgusted.The ice cream king announces that it is time to help the citizens of Bikini Bottom, the event being called the ""Nitwitting."" The Empty Heads sing a song about them being empty heads and then go out to do their civic duty. However, the Empty Heads end up hurting Bikini Bottom more than help them, making SpongeBob ask if what the Empty Heads are doing counts as civic duty. Patrick does not think about this comment very seriously, so SpongeBob continues the ""Nitwitting"" with the other Empty Heads.After SpongeBob makes a comment that the Ice Cream King finds to show that he is not dumb, he feels that he is not Empty Head material. SpongeBob eventually loses his last brain stem and becomes completely brainless. He starts to act goofy and do many awkward things, and soon ends up walking into a dark alley alone. Patrick finds SpongeBob in the alley and tells him he found his brain, though he just brought a bunch of brains inside a jar. SpongeBob finds his brain and eventually returns to his normal self. SpongeBob decides that he wants to fix the wreck the Empty Heads made, but it turns out everything was cleaned by Sandy and F.E.M.A., the club she is a part of.

This makes Patrick angry and wants to revolt for his stink-dependence.Patrick starts messing around in grimy places of the city, but when he starts messing around in the Dump, he eventually becomes so filthy he is unrecognizable. Patrick starts going around town in this filthy form, causing him to get listed in the newspaper as Filthy Muck. SpongeBob finds out about this news and tries to look for him, eventually finding him at the Dump. Since Filthy Muck has a force-field of stink, SpongeBob puts on a filthy mustache on himself to prevent the smell, but this leads to him getting into Filthy Muck's game and starts to go around in the grime as well.Another news article comes out about how Filthy Muck now has a partner. SpongeBob and Filthy Muck start going all over town, causing people to run away due to their smells, except for Old Man Jenkins, as he cannot smell. Eventually, the citizens have had enough of this, so they confront the two gross creatures and riot against them.

However, the citizens still try to run Filthy Muck out of town.Eventually, SpongeBob tries to clean Filthy Muck, and tells everyone if they work to clean him, he will turn normal again. Everyone does so, but Filthy Muck completely disappears after getting cleaned. It turns out Patrick had gone to take a bath, after he realized he would be forbidden from the Krusty Krab.

SpongeBob says he has brought a pack of Fizz Bomb Cola with him and is waiting for a Krabby Patty. Pearl says she brought her pom-poms with her and Squidina says she brought action figures. The group then starts to head to the moon but SpongeBob states he is still waiting for his Krabby Patty order, so an impatient Sandy has to drag him inside her tree. At that time, Squidward comes with SpongeBob's Krabby Patty but sees that SpongeBob is not here, so he drops it off. Suddenly, the rocket takes off with Squidward inside.In space, the gang goes up against an asteroid belt, a cold belt, hot belt, and a radiation belt, with the radiation belt mutating SpongeBob's arm and Squidward himself. Then they make it to the moon, where Sandy assigns jobs to SpongeBob, Pearl, and Squidina. While the gang is doing these tasks, Squidward is looking through craters and seeing live action things. Meanwhile, Squidina and Pearl get in a fight and Squidina throws a rock at Pearl but misses, only to have the rock orbit the moon and hit Pearl in the helmet.Squidward gets out of the craters, and starts thinking that the Moon is a ""No SpongeBob zone."" SpongeBob is looking for intelligent life, until he hears Squidward echoing ""I'm the man on the moon!"" He then finds the Krabby Patty delivery bag, and toots a horn, and Sandy comes immediately to tell SpongeBob that ""if they were really intelligent, they would've ate it. Speaking of eat, can you go get the lunch I packed in the rocket?"" So SpongeBob goes and tries to get the lunch button, moving the moon out of orbit. Sandy says that that would have disastrous effect on the Earth's tide. The Bikini Bottomites are forced to crawl on the ground to avoid suffocation. Then, strange laughing is happening outside, so the guys go to check it out.It turns out that Santa was sleeping on the dark side of the moon until Squidward accidentally woke him up. Santa then notices that the Earth is further away from the moon. He soon realizes it was because of SpongeBob, due to his history of mayhem. Then the gang try to move the moon back into orbit by burping it back with Fizz Bomb Cola, but when that doesn't work they try to sail it back into orbit, but then that won't work because there is no wind on the moon. So they try to push it back. Soon after, Squidward, Sandy, Squidina, and Pearl get in the rocket and Santa and SpongeBob are using a jack-in-the-box to move the anchor off the moon, but SpongeBob accidentally destroys the moon, with jack. The tide on Earth is now even lower. Then Santa uses a squirt gun and pumps SpongeBob full of water. After that Sandy and the guys get back to Earth, the tide back to normal.Sandy's group returned to Earth, with Pearl and Squidina now on friendly terms. Sandy offers Squidward a part in the club, though he refuses since the adventure was enough for him. Sandy then wonders about SpongeBob, who is acting as the replacement moon, teasing people in a big city. SpongeBob reveals that Santa is bringing them a new moon in December, and the citizens below complain on this news. SpongeBob realizes his error of spoiling the surprise, while Santa passes by and calls him a menace again. SpongeBob then laughs at this while wishing a happy holiday, closing the episode.",Goons on the Moon,,1.34,Kaz

He goes to the Chum Bucket and goes inside through a secret entrance, where he meets up with Spot, his best friend.The two go out of the restaurant and play with each other, but eventually get hungry and go to the Krusty Krab. While they are eating, Marvin, the animal control officer, arrives there and attempts to catch the two, but he fails, and they escape. Mr. Krabs arrives and gets angry with the officer for tripping his silent alarm and thinks he made a mess of his restaurant.Gary and Spot run away and hide at a sunken ship, but it turns out it had already been occupied. Thankfully, they were already friends with everyone in there, and they have a party. Marvin reaches them and starts dancing to the music, until it gets turned off due to the DJ getting shocked by the officer's presence.He takes all the animals except Gary and Spot, so the two go to the Animal Shelter to rescue them. After getting in and releasing all the animals, Gary finds out that Marvin is sad, as he is lonely. He tells the others this, and they all set up a dinner with a woman made out of slime. He falls in love with her at first sight and marries her soon after. He releases all the animals to thank them for bringing love into his life. Gary and Spot go back to their homes. As the episode ends, Sandy wraps up the tale by telling the viewers to stay tuned for more true to life tales of Bikini Bottom.

Meanwhile, Karen becomes completely delusional and escapes the Chum Bucket into the Krusty Krab, where she causes chaos. SpongeBob flings back up onto the surface of the inside of Karen and continues searching for destruction caused by the virus, but accidentally activates the security button. Thankfully, before he gets shot by a laser, he is saved by Ideal Plankton, who is what Karen pictures Plankton as.As the virus continues destroying parts of Karen, Ideal Plankton and SpongeBob confront different characters how Karen sees them, and gets into a battle with them. After they defeat them, the two see the virus on the other side of a trench. SpongeBob uses a rope to cross the trench, but when Ideal Plankton tries to cross, part of the ground breaks and he falls into the trench, forcing SpongeBob to have to save Karen by himself.Karen is shown driving a car to a party at Wagon Wheel due to how delusional she is. Inside Karen, the virus is shown to be eating Karen's memories, prompting SpongeBob to try and defeat it. After his attempts fail, he gets so scared he breaks into pieces. When he goes back into normal form, he winds up with one extra piece and throws it onto the ground. The virus eats this, telling SpongeBob that the virus is simply hungry. The episode ends with SpongeBob taking out the virus from Karen and letting him eat a Krabby Patty to satisfy how hungry it is before Plankton abandons it after SpongeBob confronts the virus.

She tests the cannons, only to have the ship-in-a-bottle get destroyed. She throws it out, while SpongeBob comes in, drinking the bottle, complimenting on how it was what he needed. Sandy starts to chew on her furniture, while SpongeBob asks what is happening. Sandy says there is a ship-in-a-bottle contest tomorrow, and she wants to win it, but all her ship-in-a-bottles are complete disasters. Sandy then shows all her previous ship-in-a-bottles.Sandy then says that she is all out of fresh bottles, with SpongeBob taking out the secret formula, and taking out the formula to give the bottle to Sandy. However, SpongeBob realizes his mistake, goes to an airport nearby, gets on the plane, onto a cable car into a devilish mountain. Inside is Plankton, with the formula. SpongeBob takes back the formula and goes back to the treedome. Meanwhile, Sandy has finished her new ship. SpongeBob pushes the ship into the bottle, only for it to sink in it and have Sandy start chewing her furniture again. SpongeBob suggests to Sandy that she should talk to Mr. Krabs, as he thinks that Mr. Krabs knows a lot about ships and bottles.When Mr. Krabs arrives, Mr. Krabs says that the money from the contest will be fifty fifty. SpongeBob likes that they are working together, so he gets a picture Fiasco was working on in the background. Sandy starts to make ship-in-a-bottles with a furnace. But when she shows it to Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs smashes it. When Sandy makes more, Mr. Krabs keeps smashing them. Eventually, Mr. Krabs accepts one, although he accidentally smashes that one, too. Sandy feels like a chewed-up twine after that, so she goes back to her treedome and gives up, telling Mr. Krabs that he could try to do the challenge himself. Mr. Krabs tries to find things to work with until he eventually sees Sandy's tree.The next day, when Sandy wakes, she realizes that a big ship was built in her dome made by Mr. Krabs. When Sandy asks what this is, Mr. Krabs takes her outside to show her the big ship. Sandy is astonished, but when she asks where Mr. Krabs got the wood, he said that he chopped down her tree, enraging Sandy. Sandy tries to give Mr. Krabs his comeuppance, but Mr. Krabs had already gotten on his boat and is driving the whole treedome with the ship in it to the contest. Sandy, however, is not finished, as she gets her submarine from the ground and heads to Mr. Krabs.Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is in the city, damaging property because of how big his ship-in-a-bottle is. However, he sees Sandy's submarine from the boat window of his boat, so he swerves to get Sandy off her tail. Sandy ends up destroying the front of the Krusty Krab, and SpongeBob notices this when he gets out of the kitchen. Sandy gets her submarine back on Mr. Krabs' tail, where she starts firing a ton of acorns at Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs thinks it is not enough, although he gets smashed by Sandy's submarine. Sandy then says that this is her 500th rodeo, trying to break the chain connecting Mr. Krabs' boat and the big ship-in-a-bottle. However, Mr. Krabs says that crabs are stronger than woodchucks, throwing Sandy's submarine into the distance, making Sandy chase after it. Mr. Krabs goes back to driving to the contest.At the contest, the judge checks SpongeBob's bottle. However, it does not have a ship. SpongeBob says that he is waiting for his ship to come in, as a joke, although Patrick dislikes the joke. Mr. Krabs finally gets to the contest, where he accidentally destroys the front of the place and all the ship-in-a-bottles competing because of his big ship-in-a-bottle. When the judge sees this catastrophe, he sees that Mr. Krabs' ship-in-a-bottle is quite impressive and that since it is the only one left, he would get rewarded with the trophy and the prize money.However, Sandy, in her submarine, gets in the contest and destroys Mr. Krabs' big ship-in-a-bottle accidentally. She crashes into the fountain, where she falls out of her suit with her inside only her helmet as a ball, and rolls to the judge. Since she's inside her helmet, and was the only contestant left, she wins the contest by default. Back at the treedome, Sandy has made Mr. Krabs build a replacement tree for her until she grows a new one from a seed.

Mr. Krabs orders SpongeBob to guard the front door, while Squidward decides to take a nap. Three hours pass, and Plankton never shows up. SpongeBob passes out from exhaustion and drops his mop on Squidward's face, waking him up. Mr. Krabs questions why Plankton has not shown up yet, and thinks that the door is stuck. He oils the door, while also getting rid of some customers who are blocking his path. When Plankton still does not show up, Mr. Krabs gets an idea. The next scene shows that Mr. Krabs has put the formula out in plain sight with a giant arrow pointing to it. Once the formula disappears, Mr. Krabs assumes it was Plankton who stole it and puts the restaurant on lockdown. SpongeBob starts to block off all the exits, until everyone realizes that Patrick actually had the secret formula bottle, thinking it was ketchup. It is now the end of the day, and SpongeBob and Squidward are about to go home, but Mr. Krabs stops them, fearing that Plankton is still up to something. SpongeBob and Squidward leave the Krusty Krab anyway, while Mr. Krabs stays in the restaurant overnight.The next morning, SpongeBob and Squidward arrive for work and assume that Mr. Krabs eventually went to his house. They are proven wrong however, when Mr. Krabs reveals himself, camouflaged into the floor like a chameleon. In the next scene, a customer is about to order something off of the menu, but Mr. Krabs attacks the customer, thinking he is Plankton wearing a disguise. The customer angrily leaves the restaurant, saying he will never set foot in the establishment again. Just then, Mr. Krabs notices Mrs. Puff is about to leave with a Krabby Patty, but Mr. Krabs yanks her back with a hook, suspecting her to be sneaking a Patty off to Plankton. Mrs. Puff denies this, saying that it was just a to-go order, but Mr. Krabs does not believe her. Squidward sarcastically asks if Mr. Krabs will ban pockets, to which he actually does. He uses a reef blower to suck up all of the customer's clothes and puts them in barrels. Mr. Krabs then stops Old Man Walker from leaving the Krusty Krab, as he notices that he is hiding Krabby Patties under his hat. Old Man Walker exclaims that he just wanted some for later, but Mr. Krabs does not believe him, and bans him from the restaurant. Mr. Krabs also bans a baby and its mother from the restaurant when he suspects that they are working for Plankton. Slowly losing his mind, Mr. Krabs starts banning people from the restaurant left and right, until there are no customers left. Mr. Krabs then starts boarding up the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob worries, stating that he does not think Plankton will be coming. Just then, they hear a knocking at the door, and hear a voice asking for a Krabby Patty. It is just Sandy though, but Mr. Krabs thinks she is Plankton wearing a squirrel disguise, and bans her from the restaurant too. Mr. Krabs starts to go completely insane, walking on the ceiling and foaming at the mouth. SpongeBob questions Mr. Krabs' behavior and whispers to Squidward that maybe they should postpone their ""plans"" they had for that night. Mr. Krabs overhears this, and thinks that SpongeBob and Squidward are both working for Plankton, banning both of his employees from the Krusty Krab.Later that night, Mr. Krabs is shown to have completely lost it. He has the restaurant boarded up, booby traps set up everywhere, and is hiding under the register boat with the formula tied to his neck while sweating uncontrollably. Just then, Mr. Krabs thinks he hears Plankton's voice, but it turns out to be a Chum Bucket ad on the Krusty Krab's TV. He turns the TV off, only to see a shadow on the wall that he thinks is Plankton, but it turns out to be just a cup. At this point, Mr. Krabs starts to hallucinate. He sees the cup turn into Plankton, and suddenly, red and green demon Planktons start appearing everywhere. Mr. Krabs tries to escape, but ends up running into a giant demonic Plankton with devil horns. Mr. Krabs screams and runs into the bathroom, splashing water on his face to try and reclaim his sanity. He looks at himself in the mirror, and hallucinates his eyeballs turning into Planktons. Mr. Krabs freaks out, and sprints over to the Krusty Krab's crow's next to catch his breath. Suddenly, he notices something happening across the street. SpongeBob, Squidward, Patrick, Sandy, Mrs. Puff, Old Man Jenkins, and even his own daughter Pearl are sneaking into the Chum Bucket, which makes Mr. Krabs think that everyone he cares about is working for Plankton. Mr. Krabs starts bawling his face off as he goes back into the Krusty Krab.Suddenly, a knock is heard at the Krusty Krab's front door. It is SpongeBob (who is obviously reading off of a note card), who tells Mr. Krabs that he needs to come with him to the Chum Bucket, because Plankton has kidnapped Squidward. Mr. Krabs suspects this is part of Plankton's evil plot, and tells SpongeBob he will be right out. Mr. Krabs heads into the kitchen and starts laughing to himself while making deadly Krabby Patties by putting traps, such as spikes and fireworks, inside of them. After he finishes, he and SpongeBob head over to the Chum Bucket. Once there, they see that Squidward is tied to a chair, as Plankton reveals himself. He then presses a button on a remote, and a bunch of decorations and confetti are revealed. Mr. Krabs is confused at first, but Plankton and SpongeBob explain that today is the anniversary of the first ever time that Plankton tried to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula, so they wanted to throw a surprise party for Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs is touched, apologizes for his actions, and hugs SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs then notices everyone else about to eat the deadly Krabby Patties he left on the counter. He starts to panic and takes everyone's Krabby Patties away, succumbing to their traps. The Krabby Patties start to spark loudly, zip up into the sky while Mr. Krabs is still holding them, and explode into fireworks, injuring Mr. Krabs. In the next scene, everyone happily leaves to go home (except for Squidward, who is still tied up), and SpongeBob asks Mr. Krabs if he enjoyed the party. Inside the Chum Bucket, Plankton notices that Mr. Krabs left the secret formula behind, and takes the piece of paper out, only for a stick of dynamite to be revealed underneath. The Chum Bucket violently explodes, and Mr. Krabs exclaims that he enjoyed the party very much, as the episode ends.",Plankton Paranoia,,1.18,Luke Brookshier

Perch Perkins is reporting on the news that SpongeBob is attempting to dive to the surface of the ocean, and he will be the first sea sponge ever to do so. Inside SpongeBob's house, Gary is rubbing lard on SpongeBob's back, as SpongeBob fantasizes about the upcoming event. In the fantasy, a little kid walks up to a SpongeBob statue, who talks to him. The little kid screams and runs away as the fantasy sequence ends, and SpongeBob claims that he has to warm up. SpongeBob attempts to lift some weights, but ends up accidentally throwing the weights out of his house, and exclaims that he is ready. Back outside, Mr. Krabs is seen selling SpongeBob standees. Patrick walks up to one of the standees (thinking that it is the real SpongeBob), and tries to make conversation with it. Patrick thinks SpongeBob is giving him the silent treatment, prompting him to do the same. Bubble Bass, thinking Patrick is a standee, walks up to Mr. Krabs and asks him how much he is worth. Bubble Bass ends up paying 10 dollars for the ""standee."" SpongeBob then walks out of his house and attempts to do the high sea dive off of an upside down diving board, only to fail, disappointing the crowd of people as they walk away.SpongeBob questions why he was not able to go up, to which Sandy walks up to him and tells him that Olympic divers in Texas use gravity to help them go down, and that he should use anti-gravity to go up. As Sandy walks away, SpongeBob gets an idea and runs inside of his house. He then returns to the upside down diving board, now with balloons tied to his waist, and dives to the surface of the ocean, while Squidward is seen in the background grumbling to himself and picking up trash. As SpongeBob is about to reach the surface of the ocean, he is blocked by a giant island of trash from the surface world, which also causes his balloons to pop. SpongeBob is upset about this at first, but decides to explore the trash island. He plays with a giant telephone and a giant comb, and accidentally runs into a giant building. This causes the objects, as well as a couple of others, to float down to the bottom of the ocean. Just then, a group of fish look on as a farmer uses the giant comb to grow his crops, making the fish assume that these are gifts from Neptune. Nearby, a group of campers use a giant pen to hold up their tent, and a recently married couple use the giant building as a house.Meanwhile, SpongeBob continues to explore the trash island, but out of nowhere, he is hit in the face by a giant fork. The thrower is none other than Old Man Jenkins, who has gone crazy and thinks he is King Neptune. SpongeBob plays along, claiming to be Poseidon. SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins then start throwing random giant objects at each other, causing them to float down to the bottom of the ocean. Back in Bikini Bottom, one fish uses a giant knife as a surfboard, and a couple of other fish use a giant vacuum cleaner as a car. A little girl is seen attracting a crowd of people, and excitedly tells them that if they want to receive something from Neptune, they will have to send him messages using balloons, and the crowd does exactly that. Up on the trash island, Old Man Jenkins examines SpongeBob, and discovers that he is not actually Poseidon, to which SpongeBob points out that Old Man Jenkins is not Neptune either. Old Man Jenkins explains his backstory on how he ended up on the trash island. One year ago, we see Old Man Jenkins celebrating his birthday party. A fat woman gives Old Man Jenkins about a dozen balloons, causing him to float upward. The old people seem to be apathetic to the situation, and walk back inside. As the flashback ends, a bunch of balloons are seen landing on the island, with different people saying what they want from King Neptune.Old Man Jenkins wants to go back down to Bikini Bottom to help his ""subjects,"" and SpongeBob gets the idea to build a ladder out of the trash to climb back down. Meanwhile, the Bikini Bottomites are freaking out because no more trash is coming down from the surface. As they are about to sacrifice a woman fish, the ladder that SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins built reaches the ground. Everyone thinks that if they climb the ladder, it will lead them to more free stuff. On the surface, SpongeBob finishes building the ladder, as he notices that they are right at the surface. He proudly plants a flag on top of the ocean, and the both of them start climbing down the ladder. They notice that the ladder is shaking, and the Bikini Bottomites see Old Man Jenkins, thinking that he is Neptune. This makes everyone shake the ladder even harder, but SpongeBob explains that he dove up to the surface of the ocean and found Old Man Jenkins living among the objects. The people exclaim that SpongeBob is the one that sent down the objects and call him a hero. The ladder ends up shaking so much that it completely collapses and spreads trash throughout Bikini Bottom. Old Man Jenkins surfaces out of the trash, still claiming to be King Neptune. Suddenly, the real King Neptune shows up, and smites Old Man Jenkins with his trident as punishment for impersonating him! Mr. Krabs approaches the massive trash pile and pulls a flattened SpongeBob out of it. He thinks SpongeBob is another one of his standees and throws him in the back of his truck and drives off. SpongeBob reflects on how the citizens of Bikini Bottom called him a hero, as the episode ends.",High Sea Diving,,1.21,Kaz

He then tells SpongeBob to be careful of Plankton and if he gets the ingredients, it would cause an apocalypse. Meanwhile, Plankton is listening to this conversation from afar and decides to follow SpongeBob to the ingredients. SpongeBob starts going around town looking for the ingredients, while Plankton follows him closely.SpongeBob meets Sandy and shows her the shopping list. She decides to help SpongeBob due to the ingredients being hard to get, and they use her submarine to do so, with Plankton going inside a toolbox in the submarine. They go to get a hair of a yeti krab, milk from a fangtooth fish, and ghost dandruff from the Flying Dutchman. They succeed at getting these ingredients, but every time Plankton tries to receive them, he ends up injured.When Sandy and SpongeBob have gotten all the ingredients and go back to the Krusty Krab, Plankton ambushes them and takes their submarine with all the ingredients. Sandy and SpongeBob meet the yeti krab on the ground, and he is angry at them as he lost his hair. Fortunately, Sandy gives him the fur from her tail for the yeti krab to wear, and he takes them the Krusty Krab.SpongeBob and Sandy enter the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that Plankton stole the ingredients. However, Mr. Krabs reveals that the list he gave them was fake, and he sent them to get those items to keep Plankton distracted while he ordered the real ingredients from the Barg'N-Mart in the meantime. While SpongeBob is happy he didn't cause the apocalypse, Sandy is furious at Mr. Krabs for sending her and SpongeBob on a wild goose chase for nothing (as well as causing her to lose her submarine Matilda and give up the fur on her tail.) She then beats him up in his office for it, takes a bag of his money to buy a new submarine, and then launches him into the sky, to which Mr. Krabs admits that he deserved that. Meanwhile, Plankton, believing he finally had everything to make Krabby patties, puts all the fake ingredients together, while Karen warns him not to add the ghost dandruff. The episode ends with the Chum Bucket exploding due to the fake ingredients being dangerous, causing Plankton to be blasted into the sky, where he and Mr. Krabs sadly greet each other.",Shopping List,,1.08,Zeus Cervas

SpongeBob realizes that it was his cart and tries to apologize, but then the vendor grabs him and the little clown and turns them into a hot dog shape in a bun, He squeezes SpongeBob and the clown into a bun and then proceeds to throw it and kicks SpongeBob and the little clown out from the Hot Dog stand and told him to stay out in anger.Later, at SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob tries making the little clown's appearance less clown-like and more presentable for a job. Afterward, the clown gets a job as a businessman. Due to him slamming his stamp ink-covered face onto the papers and stamping his co-workers' faces, he gets fired from the job.The next job that the little clown gets is a fireman. He drives a firetruck to Mrs. Puff's Boating School, which is on fire. Instead of using a hose to put it out, he uses clown streamers. Afterward, the school burns down and Mrs. Puff furiously screams at the little clown that he is fired.The final job that the little clown gets is a baker at the Bikini Bottom Bakery. SpongeBob has his sentient eyes enter the bakery to make sure he does not mess his job up this time. As with his previous occupations, he does not follow directions and instead throws pies at the customers. As a result, the little clown is fired. He and SpongeBob are then rolled into a pie by the head baker, Mr. Crustacean.After this catastrophe, SpongeBob concludes that the little clown is unfortunately not fit for a job. However, he then finds a place suitable for him in Kelp Forest. SpongeBob cuts the kelp with a machete and then reveals the slapstick plains. The little clown, after a long time of suffering through misery, is finally happy thanks to this place, as the episode ends.",Don't Feed the Clowns,,1.70,Doug Lawrence

Sandy then reveals that she has a nut translator and stated that nuts are nutty. However, when SpongeBob shows Gary to Squidward after he is watching a relaxation program (and the person who is in it tells him to answer the door) he mocks Squidward on many of the things he does. Because of this, Squidward goes into SpongeBob's house at night and makes Gary's collar an irritation to SpongeBob so he will remove it from him.That night when SpongeBob goes to sleep, Squidward takes out Gary's collar and puts on another collar in which he can talk through using a walkie-talkie. SpongeBob is too half-asleep that he doesn't notice the switch. After a while of making SpongeBob do tasks due to Squidward making Gary supposedly ask him for tasks, he stops doing so when SpongeBob has moved his house faraway.Unfortunately, SpongeBob's house rolls down the hill he put it in, causing it to roll down Bikini Bottom.

Eventually, Patrick shows Rube his friend, SpongeBob, while he is sleeping. Next, he shows Squidward while he is showering, but they end up getting kicked out due to Squidward wanting privacy.Patrick shows Rube the Krusty Krab and how SpongeBob cooks Krabby Patties, but when they play with the toilets, they get kicked out.

Patrick comes by in his knight costume, but he is not amused by SpongeBob's house because it is ""too cute for Halloween."" SpongeBob shows him his daisy costume, but Patrick is still not impressed because it is not scary enough. Patrick shows SpongeBob what scary is when Squidward's house scared the trick-or-treaters with onions. SpongeBob admits that he loves to go trick-or-treating, but he is too afraid to go out on Halloween. Patrick tells SpongeBob that there is no need to be afraid as long as he believes in one simple statement: Scary equals funny. SpongeBob agrees and goes with him.The first place they stop at is Sandy's treedome. Sandy appears in her mad scientist outfit and is dubbed under the name: Dr. Franken-Cheeks. She, SpongeBob, and Patrick play a guessing game with her jars of horror and she shows them her latest invention: the acorn monster. Afterwards, SpongeBob and Patrick stop over at the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs and Squidward are doing a haunted tour of the Chum Bucket. SpongeBob enjoys the haunted tour and laughs himself out. Mr. Krabs asks why SpongeBob is laughing, but SpongeBob tells him that he has a new theory: Scary equals funny. SpongeBob's theory does not intrigue both Mr. Krabs and Squidward and claim it as a major insult on Halloween. SpongeBob and Patrick stop over at the Chum Bucket, where Plankton and Karen are doing the haunted tour of the Krusty Krab. But SpongeBob finds this funny as well, which deeply annoys Plankton and Karen.Meanwhile, in the skies above Bikini Bottom, the Flying Dutchman is enjoying himself on Halloween. However, he is halted by SpongeBob's laughter. He descends downward and goes to ask SpongeBob why is he laughing on Halloween. SpongeBob says that he used to be scared until Patrick told him that scary equals funny. The Flying Dutchman is offended by that statement at first, but when he looks at the Krusty Krab decorations, he concludes that they are as laughable SpongeBob claims they are. He decides to offer them a thrill ride inside his pirate ship, which SpongeBob and Patrick agree.SpongeBob and Patrick ride inside the ship, where it is filled with ghosts, ghouls, skeletons, and monsters. Patrick is terrified, but SpongeBob still thinks it is funny. The Flying Dutchman begins to get annoyed with SpongeBob's laughter, but he soon gets another idea. Upon hearing that SpongeBob has other friends, the Flying Dutchman unleashes a ghostly mist that separates the souls of Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Gary, and Plankton from their bodies. SpongeBob and Patrick are still riding in the ship and they encounter the souls of their friends locked in cages as they call for help. SpongeBob still finds this funny as he initially does not think it is really them, until he notices Patrick's soul caged up as well. Patrick confesses that he had been wrong all along and admits that sometimes scary equals scary. After hearing that, and seeing Patrick's soulless body, SpongeBob finally realizes the damage embracing Patrick's theory has done and runs out of the ship in fear. But, despite his fear, he decides to go back and rescue his friends.Back on the ship, the Flying Dutchman tortures the souls of SpongeBob's friends. Plankton manages to set himself free and offers the Flying Dutchman a deal: Plankton takes over the world and they will split it 70-30. The Dutchman, however, ignores the offer and instead turns Plankton into his ghoulish servant. Just as the Dutchman prepares to roast the souls of SpongeBob's friends over a pit of demonic blue flames, SpongeBob appears in Sandy's acorn monster puppet. He goes to attack the Dutchman, but he ends up flying into a wall, destroying the puppet in the process. The Dutchman laughs at SpongeBob, as he believes that he is too stupid to scare someone like him. Plankton mentions the scary things SpongeBob has inside his brain, which infuriates the Dutchman to the point of stepping on him. However, he is encouraged to fly inside his brain and have a look.Inside SpongeBob's brain, the Flying Dutchman encounters various creatures flying around and they carry him everywhere. All the dream creatures succeed in doing is unnerving the Dutchman, and he concludes that SpongeBob does not have any scary thoughts in his brain. But SpongeBob, who regains consciousness, says that what always scared him is when his mother takes out his naked baby pictures. At that moment, a giant naked baby version of SpongeBob appears and hugs the Flying Dutchman. The other dream creatures approach him as well and the Dutchman becomes scared. He flies out of SpongeBob's head and runs away, frightened. As his ship disappears, the souls of SpongeBob's friends return to their bodies. SpongeBob and Patrick agree that they learned to never use shortcuts, such as Patrick's ""Scary equals Funny"" theory, to face their fears again, and everyone runs into the Krusty Krab for the party. Meanwhile, Plankton gets picked up by a trick-or-treater and eats him, mistaking him for a piece of candy, as the episode ends.",The Legend of Boo-Kini Bottom,,2.21,Doug Lawrence

They eventually start to leave, and Mr. Krabs tells Bubble Bass to eat a normal Krabby Patty and shoves one down his throat. SpongeBob then reminds Mr. Krabs of a rule in the Krusty Krab Manual: ""The customer is always right! When they have money."" Mr. Krabs then thanks SpongeBob for reminding him.Next, SpongeBob accidentally spills a drop of ketchup, which makes Mr. Krabs furious. He loses his temper and harshly yells at SpongeBob, calling him a ""Ketchup waster,"" which makes SpongeBob upset. Mr. Krabs apologizes and promises that he will not make any other outbursts. Squidward then drops Bubble Bass' napkin and makes Mr. Krabs even more furious. Mr. Krabs screams again, calling Squidward a ""waster"" and tries to beat him up. He chases Squidward with the register boat until he eventually crashes into Larry. Larry decides to calm Krabs down with a hug. After the hug, Squidward realizes that Larry let Mr. Krabs go and started running again and crawls into the kitchen and gets burned by the grill that was still on and slips into water that SpongeBob splashed onto him and crashes onto the table that Mr. Krabs and Larry were sitting in.Mr. Krabs explains to Larry that he was angry because the Krusty Krab has been so busy lately. Larry then suggests that Mr. Krabs should take a vacation. SpongeBob says that he can leave himself and Squidward in charge while he is gone. Mr. Krabs thinks about it, while the scene cuts to a flashback where SpongeBob and Squidward are in charge and the Krusty Krab is all burned down. Mr. Krabs rushes over and tells them that he needs a strong man to take care of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob points to Larry and Mr. Krabs leaves him in charge.Later on, SpongeBob is cooking Krabby Patties, when Larry comes in asking why the customers eat their meals like slobs. Larry decides to whip them in shape because he feels bad for them. Squidward is taking Fred's order. Larry puts him on a treadmill. He falls off and Frank comes to take his order. Larry gives a customer Octavius Rex's Krabby Patty order and his side salad on a very strong plate. He takes it to his table and passes out because he is so tired of pushing it. Larry takes away Krabby Patties and replaces them with Protein Power Shakes. SpongeBob tries one and spits it out because he does not like it.Larry and the strong fish change the name of the Krusty Krab to the Healthy Krab and put gym equipment for the customers to exercise. Larry orders SpongeBob and Squidward to give the customers their protein power shakes. SpongeBob gives one to Nat Peterson, who is on the rock climbing wall. The protein power shake drops on his head and he falls off the rock climbing wall. Squidward tries to give one to Incidental 37B, but he needs to jump over the hurdles. Bubble Bass trips on one of them and falls on him. It soon dawns on Squidward and SpongeBob that Larry has turned the whole restaurant into a Gym. They try to escape by climbing the cargo climbing net, but Squidward gets tangled and stuck on it.After Squidward's escape plan fails, he gives SpongeBob a plan to sabotage Larry's training sessions. SpongeBob does his plan, but forgets to untangle Squidward. SpongeBob puts butter, lard, and mayonnaise into a mixer and fills it into the protein power shakes. He gives them to Larry and his friends. Instead of drinking them, Larry rubs it on his chest. That plan fails, so Squidward gives him another plan, which is to sabotage the weight machines so they will leave. SpongeBob goes to do his plan, but once again, he forgets to untangle Squidward. SpongeBob sabotages the weight machines. Frank goes over to work out at the weight machine that SpongeBob just destroyed. He tries it and then he eventually gets himself tangled. He breaks out and loves it. SpongeBob goes to Squidward and says that he gives up. He leaves, yet he forgets to untangle Squidward.SpongeBob leaves and sees all of the customers waiting outside starving. SpongeBob asks why they are not leaving. Harold says that they will not leave because they need Krabby Patties and they do not have any at home. Because of this, SpongeBob declares war. SpongeBob and the customers get their weapons and walk out of the kitchen. They start the war, and SpongeBob's team is winning by making Larry's team eat Krabby Patties. They get everybody except Larry. Since he is too good at dodging, they have to distract him by getting Bubble Bass to try to lift weights. Larry gets distracted and SpongeBob slingshots a Krabby Patty in his mouth. Larry swallows it and thinks they are so delicious that he and his chest start crying because he could have been making Krabby Patties instead of trying to make people exercise. SpongeBob comforts him, telling him it is just because he wanted them to get in shape. Larry and his friends take their equipment back to his gym, with Squidward still stuck on the cargo climbing net. Mr. Krabs comes home and sees everything is exactly how he left it, as the episode ends.",Larry the Floor Manager,,2.07,Ben Gruber

Squidward tells them he is taking a vacation and tells SpongeBob and Patrick not to bother the guest who is renting his house while on vacation. SpongeBob and Patrick continue to play Junior Crime Breakers when they see a taxi stop at Squidward's house. Then a person steps out of the cab, only for it to be Man Ray. The TV Narrator introduces him, and Man Ray tells him he is on vacation. As Man Ray goes inside, SpongeBob and Patrick try to run up to him, but they do not get to him in time. Unknowingly, SpongeBob tells Patrick that he should be in their Junior Crime Breakers team.SpongeBob and Patrick try sneaking into the house, but that fails. So SpongeBob and Patrick decide to give him a sand pie to welcome him to Bikini Bottom. When Man Ray opens the door, SpongeBob gives him the pie and they walk in. They sit down and SpongeBob mentions about the Junior Crime Breakers to him. Patrick says he is not giving any snacks for them, so Man Ray gives him the pie, and he returns to the bathroom. SpongeBob and Patrick go to the bathroom to ask him about their Junior Crime Breakers team, but they realize this person is actually Man Ray.SpongeBob and Patrick retreat from Squidward's house and into Shady Shoals Rest Home. SpongeBob finds Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in a frozen chamber, while Patrick thinks they are ice pops. SpongeBob then realizes they are taking their cryonic nap, and they will wake up in a week. So they decide that they will have to be Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and stop Man Ray's ""evil"" vacation. They take their rings and unite them, causing an explosion. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy then abruptly awake from their nap due to the explosion.They arrive at Squidward's house, now as Mermaid Pants, and Barnacle Star. They climb a pile of trash cans up to the top windows. Patrick causes the pile of trash cans to fall down, awakening Man Ray from his nap while they hang from the window. They go into Squidward's house, and Patrick accidentally kicks SpongeBob into a shelf, breaking the shelf. Man Ray believes there are intruders upstairs, so he goes to look for a weapon. As SpongeBob and Patrick rummage through Squidward's items, they find their weapons. SpongeBob has a box full of stale cookies, and Patrick has a broken picture frame. Man Ray finds his weapon, an umbrella. SpongeBob and Patrick stumble down the stairs and confront Man Ray. SpongeBob and Patrick tell him to surrender, but Man Ray tells them he is on Holiday.They still do not believe him, so Patrick throws his broken picture frame at Man Ray. However, Man Ray opens his umbrella, and the picture frame bounces off of it and hits and destroys a huge red vase. SpongeBob then throws the stale cookies at Man Ray, but he runs away from them, as the cookies destroy Squidward's figurines. Man Ray takes cover from the cookies behind the sofa. He then throws the sofa at SpongeBob and Patrick, destroying a part of the house, and causing them to nearly fall out of the house. Patrick then gets spun around by Man Ray and thrown, hitting a glass shelf full of clarinets. SpongeBob then takes three clarinets and snares Man Ray with the clarinets. Patrick then charges at Man Ray and jumps onto him. As Man Ray is trying to get Patrick off of him, Man Ray breaks through the roof and gets them off of him.Man Ray states that he just wanted a vacation, but they still do not believe him. So, Man Ray then switches into his villain clothes, and they continue fighting, but they get scared by the thunder and lightning, and they fall back down to the ground floor. Squidward then calls Man Ray to tell him that he is returning home, due to the change of weather. Squidward says he will give him a full refund as long there is no damage to his house. Man Ray then leaves claiming that he gave Squidward a phony check, and SpongeBob and Patrick are left to deal with the damage.

The nurse tells SpongeBob and Squidward if Mr. Krabs does not get his checkup, then the Krusty Krab will get shut down by the Bikini Bottom Better Business Bureau (known as the B.B.B.B.B). Because he will not do the checkup, SpongeBob and Squidward tell the nurse they will do his checkup over the weekend for her.They first check Mr. Krabs' pinching ability by tricking him into thinking money is inside a box. However, Mr. Krabs severely hurts his hands due to pinching his own hands. Afterwards, SpongeBob and Squidward disguise themselves as a tailor and pretend to check Mr. Krabs' eyestalks, but he thinks the ""employee"" is abusing him and leaves.Later, they open a photo booth to take an X-ray of Mr. Krabs, but SpongeBob sets the machine to take too many, causing Mr. Krabs to come out all mutated and his skeleton to fall apart. Next, they open a massage parlor for the cold-blooded test, but SpongeBob thinks this means putting Mr. Krabs in extremely cold temperatures, rather than Mr. Krabs' temperature compared to the water around him, and traps him in a freezer.A frozen Mr. Krabs comes out of the freezer, and he finds out that SpongeBob and Squidward have been secretly testing him for his checkup. SpongeBob then decides to move on to the shell durability test and hits Mr. Krabs with a mallet, freeing him from the ice, but shatters his shell and teeth in the process, causing Mr. Krabs to cry because the Krusty Krab will be shut down. The two try to make Mr. Krabs exercise so he will be in fit shape when the nurse returns, but their attempts only result in Mr. Krabs getting even more hurt than he already was. Luckily, he comes up with a plan to get Larry to fill in for him for the check-up.

He finally finds a fat Spot and gives him a snack. Then, Karen comes to check Spot out, as she is wondering if Plankton is giving him too many treats. Plankton continues treating him well and Spot belches in front of him. Wanting to prove that the latter is still healthy, Plankton shows Karen its insides with X-rays, only to see that Spot is pregnant. Karen explains to him that food-rich environments such as the one Plankton provided to Spot causes amoebas to reproduce. Plankton starts panicking, while Spot is generating other amoebas. Plankton is happy that Spot made it out fine and Karen starts smearing the new amoebas on her screen.However, she gets overloaded from so much cuteness, resulting in her getting damaged. While she is rebooting, Plankton tries to control them. The amoebas destroy various things in the lab, leading Plankton to attempt to get rid of them, as they cannot hear him.A happy SpongeBob is walking down the street, making bubbles in the form of an elephant and a caterpillar. When he sees a sign near the Chum Bucket that reads ""Free amoeba puppy with order of chum,"" SpongeBob says hello to Plankton so he can see what is going on. Plankton tells him that he wants to sell Spot's puppies. SpongeBob offers Plankton to let him help have the puppies adopted.At Barg'N-Mart, Plankton drives off two scouts and their bench with their biscuits so he and SpongeBob can make room for their business. SpongeBob suggests that Plankton starts acting politely, but the latter does not seem to want to do so, evidenced by him making two of the Barg'N-Mart customers run away as fast as they can. Then, SpongeBob takes some of the amoebas, only to make a big puppy. Dave notices it and wants the puppy, so SpongeBob gives him one. A crowd of people is waiting to buy one, including Mrs. Puff, who remarks with how cute those amoebas are. SpongeBob makes, with the help of his body, more of them. However, things do not go quite positive, like an amoeba who is alone at Mrs. Puff's house starts destroying everything in their way, showing the consequences of leaving one alone.Mrs. Puff's puppy comes to the Chum Bucket. Plankton sees that it has swallowed a pearl necklace from Mrs. Puff, which makes him call him a bad puppy.It is not late for him to notice that all the other puppies came back, each of whom having something from their owner swallowed. Plankton takes from the puppies all those things, as a theft. That of the Krabby Patty secret formula is now on his mind. He is about to start training them, but Karen is still rebooting, and Plankton finds it difficult to do that alone.Plankton calls SpongeBob to train his pets. As soon as the training starts, SpongeBob shows them how to do innocent things, such as sitting and barking, while Plankton is shown at one of them how to do other things for evil purposes, such as opening a door and catching a grenade.After hours of training, Plankton introduces SpongeBob to the puppies: the Demolition Puppy, the Acrobat Puppy, the Identical Twin Puppies, and the Comic Relief Puppy. SpongeBob realizes that this has to do with the theft of the secret formula, and Plankton traps him inside a cage while explaining the plan he has in mind:Unbeknownst to SpongeBob, Plankton was actually explaining what the puppies were doing the whole time. While Plankton tries to open the bottle with the secret formula that the puppies gave to him after succeeding with the plan, SpongeBob throws with his tongue one of his eyes to Karen, which makes her fall.Plankton goes to see what happened to Karen, and SpongeBob takes again the shape and form of an amoeba, whistles at the puppies and starts barking, so the puppies can do one of the tricks he taught to them during the training.The puppies end up freeing SpongeBob from the cage with switching a lever, and he takes away the formula from Plankton, who just raised Karen. SpongeBob decides to throw some treats at him, so the puppies can eat them and become bigger.The final size of them makes Plankton's restaurant blow up, with the formula rolling to Patrick, who is Mr. Krabs' pet in this episode. He gives the formula he found back to Mr. Krabs, who rewards him with a treat.Meanwhile, Karen is now fully rebooted and looks at the amoebas on the floor of the restaurant again. She makes a maze of them, which results in a bigger amoeba. The episode then ends with it falling onto Plankton.",Spot Returns,,1.96,Andrew Goodman

The ingredients include a half-eaten Krabby Patty, two moldy pickles, and some smashed potatoes that look like Squidward. SpongeBob asks him if he got the ingredients from the garbage, but he claims that he intercepted them before they made it to the garbage. Mr. Krabs then starts listing everyone he wants to try the soup and SpongeBob asks about hippies, to which Mr. Krabs angrily repeats ""hippies."" SpongeBob informs him that there are hippies living out back by the hydrothermal vent. Mr. Krabs goes out to remove the hippies from his property, but they refuse to leave. He accidentally falls into the vent, and the hippies go inside the kitchen where it is warm. The hippies hop into the Krabby soup, while Mr. Krabs seals off the vent. When he returns to the kitchen, he and SpongeBob notice that the soup is just broth. He tells SpongeBob that he can add more ingredients. When SpongeBob throws in some ingredients, they keep getting eaten by the hippies and SpongeBob believes they are disappearing. He puts in an onion that they throw back out at him.At the tables, the hippies keep popping out of the customers' soup. They return the soup to Squidward at the counter, who tries to throw them in the trash but is stopped by Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs then returns the soup to the pot, but is surprised to see the hippies slide in while became explosive with his eyes exploded. He orders them to leave, but they refuse. Mr. Krabs tries to fish them out with long hair as bait, but is unsuccessful. He then tries to tempt them with a crochet foot-bag, but they end up kicking it into the pot with them. Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Squidward then form a drum circle that leads the hippies out. However, their hands begin to cramp and they can no longer beat the drums. Mr. Krabs says ""I wish we had another drummer,"" to which SpongeBob pulls out a toy monkey drummer. This causes the hippies to go back to the soup, claiming ""Drum machines aren't cool.""Mr. Krabs sends SpongeBob into the soup to remove the hippies. After having a conversation with the hippies, they all begin to meditate and SpongeBob becomes a hippie himself. Mr. Krabs pulls SpongeBob out and realizes he has gone too deep, so he sends him back in. Upon entering the soup again, SpongeBob finds Patrick, who also appears to be a hippie. SpongeBob says everything is getting confusing and goes to have a Krabby Patty to calm himself down.Back in the kitchen, SpongeBob realizes the Krusty Krab appears to be different. He exits the kitchen and finds Mr. Krabs meditating. Mr. Krabs tells him that he had to shut down the Krusty Krab since SpongeBob was not there to make the patties. This upsets SpongeBob, so they start dancing to cheer him up. SpongeBob asks him if they can reopen the Krusty Krab, to which Mr. Krabs replies ""I thought you'd never ask."" In order to get rid of the hippies, they remember that they need to be someplace warm. They send the hippies to Squidward's bathtub from his house, which shocks him when he begins to take a bath.

Due to a mishap, one of the Krabby Patties ends up getting stuck in the chimney, causing the restaurant to be backed up with smoke. Mr. Krabs orders SpongeBob to go on the roof of the Krusty Krab to retrieve the Krabby Patty. SpongeBob retrieves the Patty, but as he is about to walk back down the ladder, he slips on a splatter of ketchup. SpongeBob is unable to save the Krabby Patty as it splats on the ground and covers nearby people in ketchup. Mr. Krabs orders SpongeBob to climb back down, but not wanting to suffer the same fate as the Krabby Patty, SpongeBob develops a fear of heights and refuses to come back down. Sandy approaches them and offers to get SpongeBob down using her extendo-boots, but the boots end up going haywire, extending her legs all the way up to the surface of the ocean. Sandy wobbles around and accidentally kicks Squidward, who explodes in the distance. Patrick climbs up on the roof and attempts to help SpongeBob out, but he ends up falling off the roof and faceplants into the ground.Later that night, SpongeBob laments on how he misses spending time with his friends. Although, he is able to see through Squidward's window, notices that Squidward is eating all by himself, and decides to lend a helping hand, quite literally. SpongeBob brings out a flashlight so he can use his hand's shadow to date Squidward, but this backfires when Squidward starts freaking out and flees his house. SpongeBob then notices a bunch of construction supplies in the trash behind the Krusty Krab, and makes himself a bed out of wood. However, SpongeBob has difficulties sleeping that night. The next morning, Mr. Krabs approaches an exhausted SpongeBob and claims that he has a workaround for SpongeBob's roof problem. He has Squidward hoist the grill up to the roof so that SpongeBob can still cook even if he cannot get back down. SpongeBob is happy to see his grill, but claims that something is still missing. SpongeBob decides to build himself an entire kitchen on the roof using the tools he found the previous night. Later that day, SpongeBob has Krabby Patties prepared, but cannot serve them due to being stuck up on the roof.He then gets the idea to use napkins to parachute the Krabby Patties down to the customers, but the customers complain that the Krabby Patties are cold, and think that if they go up onto the roof, they will get the Krabby Patties fresh. In the next scene, we see that SpongeBob has built an entire dining room on top of the roof, much to Mr. Krabs' delight. Squidward is shown to be inside the Krusty Krab, and has decorated it to his liking, happy that he will not have to be bothered by anyone. Suddenly, rain-clouds form in the sky, and a thunderstorm reigns terror on the customers. Many people are blown off of the roof, including Patrick, who faceplants again. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to do something, and SpongeBob builds another Krusty Krab on top of the old one. However, the customers are now bored from being inside and are about to leave, but SpongeBob have an idea to make them feel entertained. He starts playing the same music that he played in the beginning of the episode, and everyone, including Mr. Krabs, starts dancing to it. Outside, we see that the rain is causing the ground to become muddy, sinking the bottom Krusty Krab underground, and sinking the top Krusty Krab to ground level. SpongeBob is happy that they are not on the roof anymore and makes a joke, causing everyone to laugh. As for Squidward, he ends up being trapped underground, making as a result in flooding him and the bottom floor of Krusty Krab in dirt, ending the episode.",Stuck on the Roof,,1.84,Andrew Goodman

He then finds out that Patrick is sleepwalking and that he is the cause of the mess. SpongeBob then tries to wake him up by calling his name, pulling his shorts, banging on pots and pans, using an air horn, pulling on his eyelids, and using his foghorn alarm. However, all of the attempts fail and Patrick sleepwalks towards the toaster. He puts two slices of bread in the toaster, then splatters a bar of butter on it, then he eats the toaster. He burps out toast, eats it, then walks towards the refrigerator. He eats a container, then puts a carton of eggs on his butt. He then continues to walk (with his head inside the fridge) and breaks the wall.

SpongeBob quickly turns him into the other direction, then quickly picks up a pot that Patrick dropped. SpongeBob then walks into a room, seeing Patrick screaming something to some fish, but SpongeBob quickly silences him. He turns Patrick around and smacks his buttocks, and then Patrick walks out of the house, over to the Chum Bucket, while SpongeBob gets kicked out of the house, through the window.SpongeBob goes to the Chum Bucket, where Patrick is about to eat some chum.

The hot chocolate used to free Patrick's tongue melts all the ice and a prehistoric sponge named ""Spongy Spongy"" emerges from it.

He has a little argument with Potty before taking a telescope to look underwater.Sandy is having a birthday party with her friends at Jellyfish Fields. SpongeBob made Sandy a birthday cake, but Patrick eats it in one bite, so SpongeBob brings a backup cake. Before Patrick tries eating her backup cake, Sandy karate-chops a slice for everyone. Squidward asks SpongeBob if it contains nuts since he is allergic. Though SpongeBob says that it doesn't, he doesn't count walnuts as nuts, causing Squidward to have an allergic reaction.A sudden earthquake happens. A big, shiny green rock arises out of a nearby volcano and is seen floating in the sky. Everyone notices it as the moon. Sandy, however, says that the moon comes out only at night. The green moon floats above a group of fish playing with a ball, turning them into biologically-accurate sea creatures. Sandy notices that every sea creature, including her friends, are enchanted by the green moon. Another fish, flying a kite, turns into a realistic fish and eats the kite. SpongeBob and Patrick run toward the green moon, turning into a realistic sea sponge (albeit a kitchen-sponge shaped one) and a real sea star. Sandy tries to warn the rest of her friends to hide from the green light and run to the shade; however, they are enchanted by the light and do not follow. Mrs. Puff and Mr. Krabs are de-evolved by the green light into a puffer fish and scavenger crab, respectively.Pearl is seen talking on her cellphone, saying that her friends should go outside and see the light. She takes a picture with her phone, then turns into a realistic sperm whale by the green light and eats the phone. Then the green light turns Larry into a realistic lobster, now unable to lift weights.The green light floats above Sandy and she fears it will turn into a natural squirrel, but when it crosses her, it does nothing to her. She assumes it happens only for sea creatures, yet she doesn't understand why this green moon turns all the sea creatures into wild fish.Sandy starts questioning if she's the only one left normal, then Squidward comes out of the bathroom. She runs towards him and puts him under a rock away from the green light. Squidward demands an explanation.Sandy calls the French Narrator, who's in a submarine in the ocean, seen on screen in a scuba-diver suit. The French Narrator stops Sandy in the middle of her sentence, saying he was looking at the green moon's actions all day. He explains about Neptune's moon and that it happens every 100 years, with its effects lasting for 2 hours.As Sandy is talking to the French Narrator, Squidward peeks out from under the rock and sees several giant fish eating each other. Squidward runs in panic to his house (and towards the moon) to save himself from being eaten, but falls over as a big, purple fish approaches and is about to eat him. Luckily, Neptune's moon is passing over, turning Squidward into a big, realistic octopus, who eats the purple fish.Sandy is afraid that Squidward will eat the rest of her friends if she doesn't act quickly. She collects them all in a net and rides on Pearl's tail. During the ride, Sandy bumps into Pearl's breathing-hole, only being blown to the air and hit by an airplane. The airplane contains only non-anthropomorphic fish, including the pilots, who are unable to control the plane and cause it to crash. Sandy lands back on Pearl's tail.Neptune's moon reaches the center of Bikini Bottom. Sandy tries to warn all of the fish, but no one seems to notice. An officer asking for a driving license from a driver is seen, when both fish are turned by the green light into realistic fish.Pearl is leaving the town and goes up. Sandy warns everyone to hold on. Then, Pearl approaches Patchy's boat, who is afraid of the coming whale. He tries to sail away, but doesn't make it, and Pearl jumps above Patchy's boat. The jump splashes water into the boat, and Patchy tries to get the water out. He unsuccessfully asks Potty for help, then decides to do it all by himself. Pearl goes back down, and Sandy jumps off her tail when she reaches her house.Sandy puts her friends, minus Pearl and Squidward, in an aquarium at her treedome. Sandy picks up another phone call with the French Narrator, asking him to explain more about her fish friends. He begins to explain every creature, but, while explaining about the scavenger crab and the puffer fish, Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff fight for a while, until Sandy picks them up, saying that she knows she would have to set them apart. The French Narrator continues explaining about the creatures and Sandy takes a picture of the primitive sponge.Squidward suddenly shows up at Sandy's treedome and starts to climb on top of It. The French Narrator explains about the octopus. Sandy says that her dome is made of pressure-resistant glass, but the French Narrator warns that giant octopuses can cut through hard materials using their beaks. Squidward cuts a hole in the dome with his beak, filling the dome with water. Sandy's aquarium friends start to float around. Squidward further breaks Sandy's dome and tries to eat her and her friends. Sandy throws her friends into her tree, then tries to escape.Squidward succeeds to hold Sandy and to insert his mouth and teeth into her tree, getting her aquarium friends cornered. The French Narrator says something about the climax of the battle. The French Narrator reminds Sandy she must remember who the giant octopus's natural enemy is. Then she remembers, frees herself from Squidward and uses her tail to create echolocation and summon the natural enemy of the octopus, the whale. As Pearl and Squidward are fighting, Sandy's aquarium friends run towards her.Sandy notices the 2 hours are up. The French Narrator says that Neptune's moon goes to the other volcano and that they'll see it again in 100 years. Then, he yells ""Goal!"" like in soccer.Everyone turns back to normal, but due to the effects of Neptune's moon, their clothes disappeared and end up naked. Everyone except SpongeBob and Patrick run away and SpongeBob asks Sandy why her treedome is broken and everyone's naked. Sandy responds that it has been the most interesting birthday that she ever had. The French Narrator says that Neptune's moon is followed by Neptune's sun. Another earthquake happens, followed by a red and yellow ball floating out of a volcano. However unlike earlier, this time it affects Sandy, and she turns into a realistic squirrel.Back at the island above Bikini Bottom, a live-action Sandy water skis on the surface of the water, passing by Patchy's boat. Patchy's boat is sinking and has a shark fin around it. He says to Potty that he never thought he would end as a shark's meal. They both accept their end, when they realize the shark fin is actually the French Narrator in his scuba-suit.The French Narrator says to Patchy that he came to warn him about Neptune's sun, but it is too late, and goes away. However, Patchy has never heard of ""Neptune's sun"". Then, Neptune's sun appears above his boat, turning Patchy into a caveman and Potty into a pterodactyl.

SpongeBob is eager to see them and takes his eyes out of his sockets to get a better view. Meanwhile, Patrick makes his eyes like binoculars. SpongeBob sees all the different kinds of clams, including the soft shell clam, the hard shell clam, the giant clam, and the razor clam. SpongeBob then takes bits of Krabby Patties as bait to lure the clams closer for a better view. Patrick then feels hungry and eats all of the bait with his tongue from the ground. SpongeBob notices and waits for Patrick to fall asleep. After he falls asleep, SpongeBob secretly takes out the bits of Krabby Patties to lure them once again for it to eventually work. Squidward notices and is not too happy with the idea. The clams enter and make a mess of his house. The clams then make a mess on Squidward for shouting at SpongeBob. Squidward, annoyed, takes a bath stating he will never be clean again.Later, SpongeBob is on his way to work, but the clams end up following him. SpongeBob tries to get the clams away from him, but they instead follow him some more. So he decides to take them with him. As a result of the clams stealing others' food, SpongeBob takes them to the Krusty Krab. Squidward notices the clams and hollers, fleeing the scene and screaming that he just got clean and that he does not want to be pooped on again. SpongeBob explicitly tells the clams to not steal anyone's food, only for this to result in all of them not listening. Mr. Krabs comes out wondering what is happening and puts him and SpongeBob under the boat. He then asks, ""What in barnacles is happening out there?"" SpongeBob replies by saying that they were stealing diverting the customers' food. Mr. Krabs then orders SpongeBob to get rid of the clams before one of them spits a pearl at Mr. Krabs. After SpongeBob scolds the clam, Mr. Krabs checks the pearl's quality and suddenly has a change of attitude towards the clams. SpongeBob decides to lead the clams away from the restaurant in the hopes of tiring them out, while Mr. Krabs chases them for more pearls.SpongeBob leads the clams to an outside café, where one of them tries to date a fish lady. SpongeBob then leads them to a children's playground, where they cause chaos. Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and most of the other townspeople find SpongeBob and the clams and order them to leave. SpongeBob sadly agrees to do so, and Mr. Krabs still asks for more pearls, only to be crushed a bigger one than before. SpongeBob leads the clams away, and the characters move back to reveal a violinist playing the background music. SpongeBob and the clams journey through the seasons, and eventually part ways when fall starts to arrive. One season later, Squidward has just finished cleaning his house when he mistakes SpongeBob for a clam because he has taken on a clam-like form. This alarms him and makes him fall in the drooling pool caused by Patrick's dribbling during his nap and freaks him out. Patrick immediately wakes up and runs around, alarmed along with Squidward. SpongeBob returns to his house where his bed is essentially a nest. He then spits a pearl at the light switch, as the episode ends.",The Clam Whisperer,,1.92,Ben Gruber

Larry even burns his eyes upon witnessing one of his paintings. Due to the chaos he has caused, Mr. Krabs decides to shut down the art show so Squidward will never be able to sell one of his paintings. SpongeBob, however, objects and disagrees with Mr. Krabs, stating that he bought one of his paintings. An art appraiser then comes in and says that the art will not even be worth a penny. However, he then says that art can be more valuable when the artist is out of the picture, which gives Mr. Krabs an idea to get rid of his employee.Mr. Krabs hands Squidward a delivery bag and orders him to send it to its respective customer. Squidward goes to Antarctica and encounters a snow sponge for whom he mistakes as SpongeBob. However, it turns out that the real SpongeBob is already there, eating some ice. Afterwards, they deliver an ice-cold Krabby Patty to an arctic sperm whale, who enjoys the food's frozen nature.Upon returning to the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs has Squidward do another delivery, which is to the Rock Bottomites. He has SpongeBob stay behind to not ruin his plan. Squidward is dropped off to Rock Bottom and then proceed to go down a ladder to reach his destination. Squidward is freaked out by the town and asks what kind of monsters its inhabitants are, to which SpongeBob arrives and says they aren't monsters, but rather his friends. He and the monsters break into a party afterwards.Later on, they return to Bikini Bottom, and Squidward is ordered to do yet another delivery, this time to Mars. Squidward is stuffed in a Rocket and sent to the planet. After touching down, he insults Mars and his words immediately angers the Martians, who eat him alive. Afterwards, Mr. Krabs is confident Squidward is gone, but SpongeBob points a UFO that drops Squidward off to mars, he is covered in green slime, affected by the events on the planet, though shortly recovers. The art appraiser then rips off the $150,000 tag off Squidward's portraits, angering Mr. Krabs for making him lose money.Fearing punishment, Squidward quickly runs away. As a result, Mr. Krabs resorts to chasing him around with a mallet in attempt to kill Squidward.Afterwards, SpongeBob sneaks up on Squidward, telling him he won't get off of him until he's safe. The latter says that he won't be safe until his paintings are gone, so the former gives him a chainsaw and encourages him to destroy them. Squidward can't go through though, since he views his paintings to be far too beautiful for destruction. After his hesitation goes away, he does tear them apart. Although Mr. Krabs finds this damage to be disruptive, the art appraiser deems it the most accelerating performance art he's ever seen. Upon realizing this, Mr. Krabs eventually joins in and he and Squidward damage the property of the Krusty Krab.This, however, goes too far, as the art appraiser does not put a cost to it. Eventually, the restaurant's roof falls apart and lands on the duo. The appraiser puts the merging of Mr. Krabs and Squidward on the wall in a museum and explains how he acquired a masterpiece with it. The episode ends with Squidward saying, ""I'm an artist,"" Mr. Krabs saying, ""I'm rich,"" and SpongeBob adding ""I helped,"" followed by a laugh.",Out of the Picture,,1.77,Ben Gruber

He crashes into a chair and finds a coupon for free ice cream under it.He leaves his rock and finds SpongeBob. Patrick tells him that he will buy SpongeBob an ice cream using his coupon. When he finds out that SpongeBob already has ice cream, he quickly throws it on the ground and tells him that he would buy a new one since he is a nice guy.Patrick goes out to get the ice cream, but is caught by Mr. Krabs' crane and Mr. Krabs says he felt the presence of something free. Mr. Krabs tries to con Patrick out of the coupon and nearly succeeds in obtaining it from him in exchange for a handshake, but Squidward appears and intervenes by admonishing his boss for taking advantage of Patrick's naïve nature. A defeated Mr. Krabs walks off, as Patrick is angry at Squidward for stopping his deal, but Squidward releases Patrick from the crane and leaves while telling Patrick that Mr. Krabs was really trying to steal his coupon.Hearing this, Patrick becomes paranoid and believes that everyone is after his coupon, causing him to run around the town getting caught in various situations like being stomped on and being attacked by toddlers until he falls off a cliff ending up in ice cream land.At the park, Patrick orders a large amazing ice cream sundae and tries to sample it before giving it to SpongeBob. However, the ice cream coupon is out-of-date, causing Patrick to throw a temper tantrum. This results in him being kicked out by one of the staff employees.Outside the park, the employee tells Patrick if he wants to redeem his coupon, he will have to go to the Ice Cream King, who lives at the top of the hill outside the park.Patrick goes to see the King, who is revealed to be a starfish who is reclusive and as clueless as him (so much that all the coupons are expired as he doesn't know the year). The Ice Cream King makes Patrick a deal. If he were to beat him in a competition, he would redeem the coupon and give Patrick the free ice cream. The two engage in a series of meaningless contests, including hair growing and ice-cream cone boxing, which ends with Patrick obtaining victory over the Ice Cream King, who agrees to honor the coupon. However, he gives Patrick a cone out of his armpit with the chocolate ice cream coming out hairy to Patrick's surprise and disgust.Patrick returns to SpongeBob, saying he wanted to give SpongeBob an ice cream, but it melted, so he got him a hearty-handshake (using Mr. Krabs' arm). However, SpongeBob lifts his dejected friend's spirits by showing he obtained a better-looking ice cream (similar to the one Patrick tried to get earlier) and the two friends eat the ice cream, as the episode ends.",Patrick's Coupon,,1.77,Kaz

SpongeBob serves the customer his Krabby Patty as he starts to hear a kid loudly crying in the distance over losing his teddy fish toy, and that his loud obnoxious crying is driving customers away. Mr. Krabs further explains that SpongeBob will have to venture into the Krusty Krab's Lost and Found underneath the kitchen to retrieve it. SpongeBob heads into the Lost and Found as Mr. Krabs wishes SpongeBob luck on his journey. SpongeBob turns on a light switch, revealing that the lost and found is actually a massive maze of shelves containing thousands of assorted items and knick-knacks. SpongeBob becomes distracted while looking for the teddy fish, playing with various lost and found's items, including sunglasses, whoopies cushions, and dancing with a rubber chicken. SpongeBob then notices a snow globe with what appears to be a miniature Bikini Bottom inside and shakes it, causing the entire town to have an earthquake. Suddenly, a cardboard box lands on SpongeBob's head, knocking him out as eerie laughter is heard in the distance.Back at the Krusty Krab, Squidward complains to Mr. Krabs that the kid is still crying. Mr. Krabs fears that SpongeBob might be lost in the lost and found and throws Squidward inside to go look for SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs warns Squidward to hurry, as the kid's constant crying is still driving customers away. Back with SpongeBob, he wakes up with four old people standing around him. The woman of the group explains that they used to be children, who have been lost in the Krusty Krab's lost and found for over 60 years and survived on the gum and mints. The old children prepare a feast of gum and mints to honor SpongeBob's arrival, but SpongeBob notices the woman has the teddy fish he's been looking for and tries to get it. The woman refuses however, since she's grown attached to the teddy fish, but SpongeBob swipes it from her anyway, determined to return it to its rightful owner. The four old children give chase.Meanwhile, Squidward, who is reluctantly searching the lost and found for SpongeBob but ends up finding a box of kazoos instead. Squidward reminisces on how he used to love playing the kazoo when he was a child, but a quick flashback reveals that everyone hated it. Squidward also finds a box of his old clarinets. Suddenly, SpongeBob runs past him, knocking over Squidward's clarinets and stepping on all of them. Back at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs accepts that SpongeBob and Squidward might be lost forever and tries to continue business as usual. However, the kids' crying drove out all the customers, prompting Mr. Krabs to give up hope and also start crying.Back at the lost and found, a chase sequence ensues, and SpongeBob and the four old children use various lost items like toilets and snails to one-up each other. The chase escalates to a point where SpongeBob is being chased through lost areas within the lost and found, including lost mines and a ""lost world"" with marine reptiles from the Mesozoic era. Back with Squidward, he sees a hatch on the ceiling and assumes it to be the exit. In actuality, it's the Krusty Krab's grease trap, which ends up flooding the lost and found. SpongeBob finally gets cornered at a series of lost dead ends, where the old children have SpongeBob surrounded. They stop their fight however when they notice the grease flooding the lost and found, and instead try finding a way to escape. At the surface of the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs and the child are still crying. SpongeBob finally returns from the lost and found by using a small Tylosaurus from the lost world, as well as bringing the old children with him. Four more elderly people arrive in the kitchen, revealing themselves to be the children's parents, explaining that they've been coming to the Krusty Krab for years in hopes of finding their children.

It has a sea urchin in it and Squidward is very freaked out by this. He tries to smash it with the register, but ends up getting the urchin on his nose. He tries to smash the urchin again, but falls out of the register, with the urchin still on his nose. SpongeBob takes the urchin off of his nose and takes it to his workplace, but the urchin bites him and falls down, turning the grill's heat to very hot, without SpongeBob noticing. As SpongeBob cooks, he becomes increasingly hotter and sweatier. He notices his mistake too late and shrinks to about the size of Plankton.SpongeBob gets up and climbs onto the counter. He notes everything he sees to be huge. He then skates on the grill using butter, but the grill burns out and turns off. SpongeBob goes down to the bottom of the grill to investigate.He finds the urchin in a mousetrap. He sets it free, and in return, it chases SpongeBob. The two run up and SpongeBob activates a soda machine. They then are washed into a drain, but SpongeBob is able to escape, while the urchin falls down.Squidward then rings the bell for a Krabby Patty. He carries one out down into the seating area and thinks SpongeBob is an urchin trying to steal a Krabby Patty, then tries to smash it. Mr. Krabs picks SpongeBob and the patty up, and flicks SpongeBob to the Chum Bucket, mistaking him for Plankton. He lands on Plankton, who wonders why SpongeBob is so small, but then measures both him and SpongeBob and boasts about being taller than him. SpongeBob then lets some measuring tape wrap Plankton. He touches it, slicing Plankton into pieces.SpongeBob is kicked out and lands on the Krusty Krab window. A kid picks him up, thinking he is an action figure. He shows the ""action figure"" to his friends and they fight over it. SpongeBob runs away, until he jumps into Squidward's shirt pocket. SpongeBob is now safe, and Mr. Krabs says the kids need to get their parents' money to get the ""action figure."" The kids run the customers out of the restaurant.Mr. Krabs then realizes the ""action figure"" is SpongeBob after Squidward points out that they do not sell action figures. SpongeBob explains how he shrunk and tries to get back to work but Mr. Krabs stops him. He says that now that SpongeBob is so small, it is too dangerous for him to cook. SpongeBob begs for a new task and Mr. Krabs says he will think of something but says SpongeBob will only earn a penny a year. He eventually decides that SpongeBob is now a personal hygienist. After doing stuff such as mowing a guy's back and doing something in another guy's toenails, SpongeBob takes a break and lays on the sink.An angry Squidward uses SpongeBob to clean the dishes, mistaking him for soap. Then Squidward, out of shock, then drops SpongeBob into the soapy water, growing him so big that he takes up the entire Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs, in SpongeBob's hand, yells for Squidward to call the fire department. The giant SpongeBob says there is no need for them to be called as he is on it, then walks there while using the restaurant as new clothes, as the episode ends.",The Incredible Shrinking Sponge,,1.83,Doug Lawrence

While SpongeBob is reading his favorite Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy comic book, he bumps into King Neptune while he is on his golden smartphone, and they both accidentally switch their hand-held objects. SpongeBob has Neptune's trident and Neptune has SpongeBob's spatula.SpongeBob continues walking to the Krusty Krab late for work reading his comic book until it is eaten. Mr. Krabs and Squidward are worried and in frustration, because the customers want Krabby Patties. SpongeBob arrives in the kitchen and wishes the tomatoes and lettuce were chopped, not knowing that the trident can grant wishes.He is surprised and doesn't remember his spatula looking different and being able to grant wishes. Later, the trident produces dancing Krabby Patties that all customers are satisfied with that they can eat. SpongeBob produces more but instead, the Krabby Patties turn evil and bigger and start to attack the customers, therefore resulting in everybody to leave the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is upset about losing money, as the frantic SpongeBob wishes he wouldn't worry about that. As a result, his boss becomes generous and starts giving away all his money to his worry.SpongeBob then thinks he can solve any problem. When a baby fish is sucking a pacifier, the parents drop it and the baby starts crying. SpongeBob soon hears the baby cry and thinks that it would put the pacifier back into the baby's mouth, it instead turns bigger and eats the baby from the trident's power without SpongeBob noticing.Later, SpongeBob sees a fish who is upset because his grass wouldn't grow, but SpongeBob uses his trident and makes his grass grow. SpongeBob continues to walk. The grass eventually turns bigger and they start talking and attempt to mow the fish. SpongeBob then finds Patrick and introduces Patrick to his new powers while Patrick is holding an ice cream cone. The light of the Trident was so bright that it makes Patrick's ice cream melt as Patrick is upset but still continues to eat it. SpongeBob then tries to solve the problem by getting an ice cream truck filled with ice cream but it later disappears. After that, SpongeBob gives Patrick unlimited ice cream using his trident, but instead, it turns into a big flood of ice cream that floods the whole Bikini Bottom.King Neptune, meanwhile still doesn't realize he has SpongeBob's spatula. He tries to battle a monster's angry mother using SpongeBob's spatula, thinking it is his trident, but nothing happens as he reads the spatula, reading ""Property of SpongeBob."" He is then beaten up and launched far away in the distance by the monster's mother for ruining her dress with the grease.In Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob tries his best to stop the flood, but he can't, and he bemoans that he has ruined everything for the town. Patrick tries to comfort his friend by saying that isn't the case, but when he sees all the things that SpongeBob has done to everyone with his deeds and the bad aftermath, he is forced to agree with him.SpongeBob states no sponge should have this power and is annoyed when the Greek chorus appears to agree with him. A battered Neptune then shows up, wanting to give SpongeBob back his spatula as SpongeBob finally learns the item he was carrying was really a trident.He tries to give it back, but the trident doesn't obey, forcing Neptune to combat it. After getting his trident to submit, Neptune scolds it for the trouble it has caused before being happy to have it back and the trident becomes delighted. With the trident, Neptune repairs all the damage caused by SpongeBob as the town and citizens return to normal.SpongeBob promises to repay Neptune as the latter says there is actually one way, he has SpongeBob join him as they create a giant Krabby Patty monster to go after the Krakens that beat Neptune up earlier.",Trident Trouble,,2.07,Ben Gruber

Plankton initially tells the newsman some of his evil schemes, but gets fed up when the cameraman frequently takes advantage of Plankton's interview.Later on, Plankton rides a robot seahorse to the Krusty Krab. Plankton peeks into the Krusty Krab to find Mr. Krabs' office safe appear to be open, appearing as though the Krabby Patty secret formula is exposed outside of the safe. Plankton rockets his way there, only to get hit by a paper photocopy of the safe that has been pinned on the wall. Mr. Krabs soon rolls him up into the piece of paper and feeds it to his robot seahorse.Plankton tries a variety of other different techniques to take advantage of getting the formula. All of them fail: first by grabbing a sea-urchin-infested Krabby Patty, second by getting intercepted of Mr. Krabs while flying, shoving a jellyfish-hive into a hole which causes jellyfish to sting Plankton, and even by Mr. Krabs hiding in the same stomach of another Krusty Krab customer.He tells Karen about all those failures, and Karen tries to calm him down. Plankton tells her about giving up the Krabby Patty secret formula. Karen criticizes how he frequently gives up, but Plankton unplugs the power before she can say anymore. He then steps outside to bury the Chum Bucket, with the help of the Chum Bucket hand, to show that he has retired.Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs notice Plankton's strange activity. They soon quickly follow the bus using a fishing rod as a grapple rope. They reach a town named Dullsville, a town full of retired people and elderly-people-targeted shops. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob soon follow Plankton to Plankton's new hotel room at Dullsville Senior Living. They watch all his activities in a ceiling fan.Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob suddenly fall from the ceiling fan, and Mr. Krabs explains that he is happy to retire. Plankton then states he is already at the Krusty Krab stealing the formula. This is revealed that Robot Plankton is actually a decoy of Plankton.Meanwhile, the real Plankton casually walks to Mr. Krabs' office to steal the secret formula, unseen by anyone. Soon afterwards, the real Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk in to catch him with the formula. They soon tell him the two in Dullsville are simply robots disguised as decoys. Then the real Plankton gets really annoyed and bashes his head on the ground multiple times. Later it shows the undisguised Robot Krabs, Robot SpongeBob, and Robot Plankton, talking about themselves as android decoys.Back at the Krusty Krab, Plankton is convinced the real Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are the real ones. He soon runs with the Krabby Patty secret formula, constantly crashing into fellow customers, while SpongeBob gets a call from someone and answers it. Meanwhile, with the robot characters, Robot Krabs, Robot SpongeBob, and Robot Plankton are enjoying their holiday time with each other. The episode ends with them cheering and suddenly exploding.",Plankton Retires,,2.07,Doug Lawrence

SpongeBob says that he is not feeling good about his life, and Gary pushes SpongeBob out of the room. SpongeBob suddenly falls down the stairs, crashes into the wall and the toaster, and then crashes onto his TV.The TV suddenly turns on and an advert for life insurance appears. Gunther Fitz, who appears on the TV, then interacts with SpongeBob about getting SpongeBob's life insurance. Gunther Fitz is trying to get SpongeBob life insurance by making him sign a contract through the television. Patrick then comes to his door to meet him to send him his mail. Patrick excitedly jumps around, but then suddenly asks what life insurance is. SpongeBob tells him that, by his interpretation, for the rest of their lives, they are protected from being hurt. Patrick disagrees on the contract, but SpongeBob tells him to try to get hurt to test the life insurance. Patrick then agrees to get hurt to test it.Outside, SpongeBob and Patrick are having a pillow-fight. Meanwhile, Squidward shows off his new toupee in the mirror. Squidward gets angry and asks SpongeBob and Patrick what they are doing. SpongeBob replies that he and Patrick are attempting to hurt each other. Squidward walks off, but suddenly has an idea of telling SpongeBob and Patrick to hurt each other with harder objects. Patrick then is handed a rake, which he uses to golf Squidward back to his house. Patrick then throws the rake into Squidward's house, disbelieving that Squidward got hurt. Squidward then suddenly finds his toupee on his nose, thinking it is a sea spider, and then bangs himself with a rake in an attempt to take out the ""sea spider.""Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick continue trying to get hurt by falling off objects several feet high. Squidward gets annoyed, and then tells them to fall off something higher. SpongeBob and Patrick then try to summon jellyfish to allow themselves to get stung. Squidward gets surprised, accidentally dropping his toupee into the toilet. He quickly retrieves it and re-puts it on his head. Squidward then asks what they are doing, and they reply that they are having their ""final test"" by attempting to be stung while having life insurance. A large jellyfish is summoned, but ignores SpongeBob and Patrick and zaps Squidward instead.Because of that, SpongeBob and Patrick recommend Squidward about life insurance. Patrick even tells him about their recently made dangerous obstacle course, which they name the ""Sushi-Maker."" SpongeBob and Patrick give him their life insurance contracts and he initially disbelieves that it will work. After several near-misses, he soon agrees and runs off to do dangerous activities, including running through a ""brick wall"" that turns out to be a super large canvas and intimidating a tough guy into attacking him, and avoids getting hit by him. SpongeBob and Patrick then come to meet Squidward and are concerned about his reckless behavior. Squidward then licks an ice cream that had recently been dropped on the ground by the same guy he was attacked by, then arrogantly tells them that he will try the Sushi-Maker.Near the obstacle course, Squidward climbs up a very tall ladder to jump into a pool of hot lava. Mr. Krabs happens to walk towards SpongeBob and Patrick to ask about what is happening. They reply to him that Squidward is proving that he is invincible because of his life insurance. Mr. Krabs then tells them that's not the way life insurance works and explains to them that it was really money the buyer gets when a person dies, and then asks who gets the money. SpongeBob takes the contract from Squidward and tells Mr. Krabs no one has signed it yet, so he signed it himself so he can collect the money. Mr. Krabs then cheers briefly for Squidward before leaving, hoping he will die so he can collect the life insurance money.A horrified SpongeBob suddenly realizes that Squidward was right all along that life insurance doesn't really protect them from danger and all those near-misses they had previously were only coincidental. He and Patrick try to alert Squidward of the news, but he ignores them and soon falls off the springboard into the lava pool when SpongeBob and Patrick shake the board to try to stop him. Squidward immediately screams as he jumps out of the lava and goes through the entire obstacle course, being repeatedly hurt by it before finally being launched from a cannon into a heavy bell at the local high school, and is trampled by the students leaving the building. Luckily, Squidward is still alive, but is full of blisters and grazes. SpongeBob and Patrick then run up to Squidward and tells him that they were wrong about life insurance and that it doesn't protect one from injury. When they ask how Squidward survived the Sushi-Maker, he tells them he thinks it was because of his toupee and SpongeBob and Patrick, once again thinking it is a sea spider, both step on it, ending the episode.",Life Insurance,,2.13,Kaz

One customer states he could die and go to heaven and kisses SpongeBob's feet, to SpongeBob's discomfort. Mr. Krabs tells Squidward that the customers love their Krabby Patties, to which Squidward tells him that some people are calling it the ""SpongeBob Patty."" Mr. Krabs calls that ridiculous, as it has always been the Krabby Patty, only for a customer to come up and order a ""SpongeBob Patty."" Squidward smugly tells Mr. Krabs that he should change the restaurant's name from the Krusty Krab to SpongeBob's Place.One of the customers overhears him and states that it is a great idea. The other customers agree, and they start chanting ""SpongeBob's Place!"" A jealous Mr. Krabs tries to get them to chant ""Krusty Krab"" instead, but they ignore him. SpongeBob tries to give the chant some juice, but this only makes the customers resume the chant of ""SpongeBob's Place!"" Squidward tells Mr. Krabs that he would be nothing without SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs asserts Squidward that that is not true, as he is the one who created the Krabby Patty, only for the customers to carry SpongeBob by on a throne, singing ""Let's all go to SpongeBob's Place."" This makes Mr. Krabs jealous at SpongeBob's success.Later, Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob that the Krusty Krab is haunted and needs ghostbusting. SpongeBob agrees to stay away until the ghost busting is done. Squidward easily sees through Mr. Krabs' lie and quickly deduces the real reason for sending SpongeBob home, which Mr. Krabs confirms by announcing that he is going to be doing the cooking from now on.Meanwhile, at SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob quickly gets bored and decides to make Krabby Patties at home. He sees nobody, so he puts them on the window. People smell the patties and, after eating them, insist that he make more.Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is having no such luck. The customers keep sending back their Krabby Patties. Squidward tells him that it is because they are not as good as they used to be, to which Mr. Krabs retorts that it is the same formula. One of the customers looks inside the kitchen and afterwards announces to the other customers that the problem is that SpongeBob is not in the kitchen. This announcement makes the other customers angry to the point where they decide to leave. To keep them from leaving, Mr. Krabs dresses up like SpongeBob and the customers actually fall for the paper-thin disguise.Unfortunately, his food is still poorly made to the point where it tastes disgusting. However, the customers say they like it for ""SpongeBob's"" sake. Not realizing that they are not being sincere, Mr. Krabs reveals himself and states that it is his food that they are ""enjoying."" This angers the customers to the point where they drop the act and flat out tell him they find his food disgusting and once again try to leave. Mr. Krabs tries to stop them by making a moat and filling it with molten lava, stating that anyone trying to leave will have to go through him. The customers use him as a drawbridge and leave. Squidward follows suit, and Mr. Krabs gets burned by the lava.When Squidward gets home, he finds a crowd eating Krabby Patties at SpongeBob's house, which has a sign that reads ""SpongeBob's Place"" on it. This angers Squidward, so he decides to call the health inspector. Meanwhile, in an ambulance, Mr. Krabs is having his burns tended to by paramedics. He gets out and looks around when he sees SpongeBob's home as the restaurant. This has made SpongeBob so rich he does not know what to do with all the money.He gives Mr. Krabs a Krabby Patty and the taste makes Mr. Krabs realize why everyone prefers SpongeBob's Krabby Patties over his, despite the fact they use the same formula: SpongeBob's food is delicious because he prepares his Krabby Patties with tender-loving care and is in most ways an excellent cook, while Mr. Krabs is in most ways a horrible cook and prepares his food with selfishness-induced carelessness to the point where his Krabby Patties are poorly prepared and disgusting. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob he deserves his own place, but SpongeBob tells him he needs a boss, and Mr. Krabs happily obliges. Mr. Krabs takes 99% of the business and money while SpongeBob agrees to have 1%.The next morning, Squidward walks into the empty, destroyed Krusty Krab and starts to sing in happiness because no one will be there to bother him. However, the health inspectors shut SpongeBob's Place down for violations, so they go back to the Krusty Krab. Just as everyone arrives, they hear someone singing inside. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob peek inside and see Squidward dancing and singing about how much he hates his job and people, Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and the Bikini Bottomites. Mr. Krabs is outraged at Squidward's insults and gets very angry at him while the customers laugh. Squidward shrinks in embarrassment. Afterwards, Mr. Krabs gives SpongeBob a very special surprise: he decides to share the name with his restaurant by adding ""SpongeBob's Place"" on the Krusty Krab sign, much to SpongeBob's delight, as the episode ends.",SpongeBob's Place,,2.27,Kaz

SpongeBob eventually allows the worm to stay in his head for a night after the worm cried when tried to be forced out of him. He later names the worm Prickles, after the prickly sensation the worm has on his head.Later, while SpongeBob continues to sleep, Prickles gives the all-clear to other worms about the good residential worm area and they all later party inside SpongeBob's head. Gary, being completely fed up with the new worms, kicks SpongeBob out of the door as well as throwing his pants and deodorant to SpongeBob. After doing his morning routines outside his house, he goes to work at the Krusty Krab. He tells all of the worms not to appear outside during his work time, or else he will risk losing his job.At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs notices SpongeBob with many worms peeking out of SpongeBob's pores. He warns SpongeBob against having worms on his body. However, the worms ignore Mr. Krabs' warnings and throw their trash onto the patty stove. Mr. Krabs soon loses his temper and fires SpongeBob immediately until SpongeBob gets the worm issue under control.Walking outside, SpongeBob meets Plankton on the way. He explains to him that he got fired from having worms around him. Plankton asks SpongeBob if he could remove the worms in exchange for a deed for Plankton himself, which SpongeBob agrees to. However, when Plankton tries to get rid of all of the worms, he ends up being crippled and surrenders.SpongeBob walks to his neighborhood and asks Patrick for help, but he refuses because of SpongeBob's scary appearance. Then he asks Squidward for help, but quickly hoses on SpongeBob in attempt to get the worms out of SpongeBob, and even Gary barricaded SpongeBob's house (and possibly locked the door) to prevent SpongeBob from coming in until the worms are gone.SpongeBob, now sitting by himself, and at the edge of insanity, declares himself to be ""SpongeBob WormPants"". Hopelessly believing he'll spend the rest of his life as an apartment for worms, SpongeBob laughs at the new name he has given to himself. He laughs so hard that all of the worms were annoyed by this; Prickles, realizing what they've done to drive SpongeBob crazy, quickly tells the other worms to leave his head, which they do so.Gary comes back to SpongeBob when he is relieved that he is finally worm-free, and he hugs Gary before heading back inside. Meanwhile, the worms break into Squidward Tentacles' house and settle in it, much to Squidward's horror.One morning, Prickles gets out of his house, which is a can of beans, to relax on a mouse trap. When a clam causes ruckus, the worm throws a boot at it, only for it to come back to annoy him further.Prickles cooks some beans, but unfortunately the clam smells them and comes to eat them. After it kisses the worm for making the beans, Prickles becomes extremely angry and screams for some time.He then puts a trail of beans towards the can of beans to trick the clam into getting trapped inside. The plan works, and he throws the can to a mailfish to send faraway.Unfortunately, Prickles no longer has a house as he sent the clam away using the can of beans. At night, he is wandering around, only to realize that the clam has escaped the can. It tries to attack him as revenge for sending him away in a bean can, but he finds a piece of coral to hide behind, and afterwards seeks refuge at SpongeBob's house, which starts the series of crazy events in the first place, as the episode ends.",House Worming,,2.12,Richard Pursel

He drinks some warm milk, turns on his noisemaker (which makes a bubbling sound), dims the lights, sings himself a lullaby: ""Sleep, little Squidward, catch some winks. Everything and everyone stinks,"" and attempts to sleep. He then gets quickly woken up by a giant, loud burp caused by SpongeBob and Patrick drinking a large amount of soda, which SpongeBob and Patrick both laugh at. Squidward tells SpongeBob to stop and that he has not slept for three days. He also tells him that he has to be ready for the Bikini Bottom Philharmonic auditions the next day. SpongeBob tells Squidward to take a walk, and Squidward decides to follow his advice. He finishes his walk and goes to SpongeBob's house, thinking that it is his moai. SpongeBob turns into a bed, and Patrick and Gary join with Squidward sleeping on SpongeBob.The next morning, the gang has woken up, except for Squidward. SpongeBob and Patrick try to wake him up, but to no avail. The two later make Lab Squidward, but he unfortunately crashes outside the lab and wreaks havoc to the town. Patrick later gets the idea of crawling up Squidward and playing him like a puppet. Later on, the two got ready to control Squidward's body. The two play around with Squidward's body for a while, then they both leave (while in Squidward's body) for the Philharmonic. While doing so, they have trampled on several people and crash a car. A police officer tells the two that the place is a ""no-dancing zone.""SpongeBob realizes that he does not know where the concert hall is. He later asks an old lady where the concert hall is. While doing so, they catch up with the attention of several people. SpongeBob sees a bus that leads to the concert hall and boards it.The two arrive at the concert hall for the audition, with Octavius Rex and the conductor inside it. While entering the concert hall, the two make a big mess on the stage. SpongeBob asks where Squidward's clarinet is, and Patrick says it was on his backside. The two have Squidward play the clarinet, at first terrible and off-tune (which leads to the conductor calling in the next person), but later plays it well, much to the surprise of the two. In the middle of the audition, Squidward wakes up and is surprised to see he is at the audition. Squidward later finds out that SpongeBob and Patrick were inside of him, and later spits them out of his body.The conductor later calls Squidward a ""musical genius,"" much to the happiness of Squidward. He later plays (without the two's control) and the two get so irritated by it that he gets kicked out. The scene cuts to the bus, with SpongeBob and Patrick sleeping beside Squidward. Squidward later sees Lab Squidward wreaking terror in the city while oddly playing a ""clarinet"" (in reality just a house), oddly much to the joy of the townsfolk, as the episode ends.",Snooze You Lose,,2.12,Kaz
